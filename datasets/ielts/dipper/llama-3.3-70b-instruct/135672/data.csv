1095;A country becomes more interesting and develops more quickly when its population includes a mixture of nationalities.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is belived that countries are developing faster and become more inspiring when their populations consist of variety of people with different nationalities. In my opinion, it is very controversial question, but I believe that nations who are tolerant to others and friendly are able to succeed in constracting better world not only for themselves and their surroundings but also for future generations. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view about attractiveness and development of countries based on national diversity.On the one hand, people of different nationalities are hardly able to understand each other and can be impatient for people who have another nationalities, that can create difficulties in communication, making agreements, sovling of problems. For example, people with different backgrounds can strat arguing about better governmental constitutions and politics, religions, educational system, traditional and another types of medicine, and so on. It worths to mention that none of those people will be completely right, if they deside to show off their experience instead of accepting ideas of others and just giving advice. Moreover, some disputes can even lead to quarrels, but not to finding the better dessisions, that can influence on safety of people with different nationalities. So, for living peacefully and sharing some ideas of better developmental practice, people should first of all respect each other independantly of their nantionalities.On the other hand, people of various nationalities are able to create not only interesting and diverse community, but also share knowlege and experience in order to achieve the best results in countries' development. For achieving this, people should follow several basic rules, which are usually unwritten, but those mental and behavioral lows should be understood by everyone. Firstly, they should be tolerant to each other and accepting some differences. Secondly, they should be polite when they want to share their knowlege and experiences, not showing off. Thirdly, it would be wonderful if they are able to create international community where people can communicate and make friends. Last but not least, they should remember that their attitudes for each other influence on the world as a whole where they and their children live, so they should be responsible for their words and behavior.In conclusion, countries which managed to connect people of different nationalities and create a friendly surroundings, in my opinion, are able to develope faster and look like fascinating diverse community which consist of people of various backgrounds.; On the one hand, a multiethnic society has the advantage of having different ideas, experiences and points of view, which can lead to progress and innovation. The question whether a country is more interesting and develops more quickly with a mixture of nationalities is often disputed. I would say, I think I agree to some extent that a diverse population can contribute to a country's growth and attraction. The United States, for example, has been a country that has thrived on diversity, where many people have settled in the country, thus making the country richer in cultural diversity, technology and prosperity. The multiethnic society has made the country a hub for international trade, education and tourism, thereby accelerating the country's development. In other countries such as Canada and Australia, where the number of people from other countries is high, there is a strong sense of community and solidarity. The diversification of the population has made the countries more open to new ideas and innovations, which in turn has contributed to their economic and social development. On the other hand, a multiethnic society can lead to creativity, tolerance and understanding between people. It is therefore conceivable that a country with a mixture of nationalities will become more interesting and develop more quickly. However, it is also important to note that the diverse population may bring with it some challenges, such as integration and linguistic barriers. However, with proper management and policies, these challenges can be overcome and the benefits of diversity will be achieved. Multiethnic societies also make people more tolerant, so the development of a country is faster.
1374;Advertising affects what people think is important and has a negative effect on their lives (agree/disagree);Today people are surrounded by advertising. This affects what people think is important and has a negative impact on people’s lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?With the advent of the Internet, advertisements, originally displayed only on TV, billboards, posters and so on, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and commonplace for the general public. In my view, this kind of impact could be both crucial and, on a certain level, detrimental.On the one hand, this phenomenon could denote that although we have already had a diverse range of , people are still capable of inventing innovative approaches catering for all kinds of requirements of advertising. It is a symbol that demonstrates the creativity rooted in human beings. Apart from that, it also represents that the speed of spreading information is conspicuously escalating. More purposeful is, therefore, the fact that, besides booming of the advertising, it constitutes a major reason why people could be so prosperous in this digital age.On the other hand, there are various unpleasant consequences as well. Firstly, with the omnipresent , it could potentially cause people to do impulsive shopping. Secondly, the , if regulated in a mismanaged , could make people constantly feel uncomfortable or annoyed. In this sense, instead of being an instrumental tool to promote amenities, advertisements could be considered a hindrance when people are frequently blocked by them. Furthermore, it would cost one precious time to have to sift the helpful ad from a host of others.In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, advertising is a beneficial phenomenon for all with a number of insignificant drawbacks. I believe that in the future we can improve the way advertising is done at present, and embrace the positive influence of advertising even further in the long run.This essay is another example of what Band 8 writing may look like. It’s weak point is that the author goes slightly off-topic while trying to discuss whether advertising affects what people view as important and instead talks about the reason advertising is spreading and about human creativity. However, the other part of task type (negative effects of advertising) is covered well, the ideas are well-developed and supported. There is a clear logical flow of information and a range of transitional words is used appropriately to sequence ideas. The way author uses synonyms to rephrase the task topic in the intro paragraph demonstrates their lexical skill, which is also evident in other parts of this essay. There are many complex sentences and very few errors. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.0.; This has become an integral part of our daily life and affects our thoughts, feelings, and behavior. The media, including social media, television, and billboards, have influenced us about what we want, what is important, and what is necessary. I agree that advertising affects what people think is important and has a negative effect on their lives. Advertisements often show unachievable and perfect lifestyles, making people feel insufficient and not satisfied with themselves. This often leads to an insatiable desire for more and more things, resulting in financial stress, debt, and reduced satisfaction. In addition, advertisements change people's values and priorities, thus changing their lives. The focus on external appearance, wealth, and status can distract people from what is really important and rewarding, such as relationships, personal growth, and social responsibility. In addition, constant bombardment can also lead to anxiety and a decrease in self-esteem, because people feel the need to conform to a society. To conclude, advertisements have a significant impact on what people think is important and can have a negative effect on their lives. They create a sense of dissatisfaction and alienation, because people focus more on material things and status than on personal fulfillment and personal values. Individuals must develop a critical awareness of the influence of advertising and a more balanced and realistic view of what is important in life.
1395;Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone’s life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is a negative one. Discuss both views and include your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. You should write at least 250 words.;Many people wonder about . Some people think that it has negative impact in our life. However, positive effect on this world.? Of Course for several reasons: firstly, it motivates the psychological point in everyone, and women in particular. They will run to buy this advertised product especially if it’s from , just to show their beauty to men, which may lead to negative effects of too much sexual attention. Secondly, you can sit comfortably with your family and suddenly the telephone is ringing, but it’s nothing important, it’s just another company to convince you to buy one of their products. It is a real . Lastly, sometimes you do not have the financial ability to buy something, but with these new methods of advertisement, you run to buy it, which affect your budget.On the other hand, there are some good sides to advertising. For instance, it compares the prices of many companies which the consumer. Besides, it really see more products which we unless the TV or Radio advertised them. , it breaks our daily routine and allows us to see new faces and learn the language better with the help of the daily updates they deliver through .In conclusion, as we can see there are many aspects to this . I feel that we gain no benefits at all from advertisement, it plays buy more things that they do not need it at all.; The views are often very controversial. On the one hand, some people believe that advertising is a positive part of our lives because it informs us of new products, services and ideas, which can improve our lives and give us more choice. In addition, it can promote certain cultural and social values, such as equality and the environment, by its powerful and thought-provoking messages. On the other hand, some people see advertising as a negative part of our lives. For example, drug advertisements and health campaigns can educate people about diseases and their prevention. But some advertisements for food or cosmetics often exaggerate or make false claims about the products which can be harmful to consumers. Also, advertisements can be misleading and deceptive and lead consumers to make poor buying decisions. Finally, some people believe that they can influence people to buy unnecessary products and lead them to live a materialistic life. In my opinion, advertising can be both positive and negative, depending on how it is used. For instance, some advertisements, such as pop-up windows, unwanted emails and loud commercials, can disturb our daily lives and cause annoyance. I believe that to make advertising a positive part of our lives, companies and marketers should make their ads truthful, fair, entertaining and respectful to consumers’ time and intelligence. We as consumers should evaluate advertisements critically and make responsible buying decisions.
845;Boxing is a blood sport which often results in physical injury. It is inappropriate for this sport to exist in the modern age.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;There is debatable issue as to whether boxing, a seemingly bloody sport, should be excluded from the modern society. As far as I am concerned, the attempt to remove boxing from the current age is utterly unjustified.Admittedly, boxing is often associated with various disturbing factors, such as foul language, disregard to rivals, violent punches and inelegant appearance as a result of intense physical contacts. However, such gory scenes may frequently take place in underground boxing games which are barely recognised by the professional community of boxing and by the legal system. Unlike underground boxing, professional boxing upholds moral principles and universal values, for examples, respect to opponents, obedience of rules, etc. Also, professional boxers are protected by safety equipment and judges who may stop the game when witnessing any player suffering serious injuries. Therefore, the health hazards involved in boxing games may not be as severe as the public assumes.Another reason reinforcing my position is that boxing already enjoys considerable popularity around the world and plays an important part in people's entertainment, as exemplified by the successful ticket sales of most boxing games and high audience rating of TV programmes broadcasting boxing matches. Given such popularity of boxing, the removal of this sport may cause widespread dissatisfaction and complaint.To draw a conclusion, the exclusion of boxing is completely groundless and irrational, given the safety protection, sportmanship and popularity as reflected in this sport. I expect in the future, more views could arise to furnish the understanding in this regard.; While it is true that boxing often results in physical injury, I do not think it is inappropriate for this sport to exist in the modern age. The first reason for this is that boxing, like any other contact sport, carries inherent risks that participants are aware of and are willing to accept. In addition, boxers and boxing organizations place great emphasis on the importance of health and safety and emphasize the need for responsible behavior in the sport. The second reason why boxing should not be abolished is that boxing may have some benefits. Boxers go through rigorous training and preparation to minimize the risk of injury and are required to wear protective gear. In addition, boxing can help people develop discipline, self-confidence and self-esteem, which are essential skills for life. For example, the world champion boxer Manny Pacquiao came from a poor family to become a world champion, which shows that boxing can change people's lives. And finally, boxing has a rich history and culture and is considered by many to be an art form that requires strategy, skill, and physical strength. Therefore, while boxing does involve the risk of physical injury, I think that with proper health and safety measures, and the encouragement of responsible behavior, it can still exist in the modern world. The benefits of boxing, such as personal development, social mobility, and cultural significance, far outweigh the disadvantages.
1429;Boys are most influenced by their fathers and girls are most influenced by their mothers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons to support your opinion.;It is true that nowadays have a great influence children. Some people hold the opinion that the same sex is the major determination of influencing parent, but others . As far as I am concerned, . My arguments for this point are listed below.First of all, a father is the person who have already passed ways his son is passing now, in other words, sons are following their father’s footsteps. , based on experience it is easy for a father to notice his sons’ drawbacks and to influence them.Secondly, it is true that a boy is , a girl is a subtle and fragile one. It is hard for mothers to influence their sons, because it is not likely that can affect a strong one.In conclusion, it seems to me unfair that boys are most influenced by their mothers. Based on at least two points above I strongly agree that children are influenced by a parent of the same gender.; If I agreed with this statement, I would say that while parents have an important influence on the upbringing of their children, the idea that it is a strict male-female split is oversimplified. However, I don't agree with this statement. For example, a boy can learn emotional intelligence and sympathy from his mother, and a girl can learn self-reliance and toughness from his father. In reality, both parents have a very deep influence on their children, regardless of their gender. It has also been found in research that the upbringing of children is very complex and influenced by many different factors, including family background, social environment and individual personality. It can be seen that in many families, both parents share the responsibility of raising children and both parents are able to teach children, so it is difficult to find one parent who is more influential than the other. As a result, it can be seen that the influence of the father and mother on the child is not limited to one or the other gender. Therefore, it is not reasonable to say that the influence of the father is on the boy and the mother is on the girl. It is important to understand and appreciate the different family relationships and different ways of teaching parents.
1364;Changing drivers age limits is the best way to reduce traffic accidents (from Target Band ;This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskThe best way to reduce traffic accidents is to raise the age limit for younger drivers and to lower the age limit for elderly ones. Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsIn today’s world the number of traffic accidents is constantly rising as well as the number of injuries and deaths they cause. A better regulative approach is required traffic accidents can be reduced. Some people say that changing the drivers’ age limits is the best solution to the problem. However, there are other, more practical ways to deal with this problem.One alternative is imposing heavier fines the drivers who exceed the permitted alcohol consumption. According to recent , a great proportion of traffic accidents has alcohol as its reason. Utilising technology and installing devices that detect drunk drivers and lock car ignition can be used to keep people with track record of drunk driving off the roads. On some occasions and for repeat offenders in particular, a prison sentence may also be considered.Furthermore, people should be better educated and more careful while behind the wheel. To be more specific, people should learn to obey road rules and respect the other drivers instead of causing tension or submitting to road rage. In addition, heavy fines should also be levied for exceeded speed limits. Last but not least, safer and wider roads should be constructed to make for easier and more comfortable driving.Tightening age limits for drivers can be a complementary approach. For example, the elderly with vision problems or other important health issues should be excluded from driving. Besides, young people under 18 years old are considered immature to drive. However, maturity does not necessarily always increases with one’s age, which is why other measures are needed dangerous driving.In conclusion, I believe that stronger measures should be implemented for the prevention of traffic accidents, and drivers should have a more responsible attitude. Setting age limits could be helpful but should not be considered the optimal and only solution to the problem.The writer’s position is clear throughout the essay. There is a logical organisation of information and effective use of paragraphing. The range of vocabulary is wide enough for the student to show flexibility and accuracy of expression. Overall, the control of grammar and punctuation is good, with only a few errors made. The essay is up to the mark and is likely to get Band 8 in IELTS.; At the same time, it is the best way to prevent accidents caused by inexperienced young people. The argument that changing drivers age limits is the best way to reduce road accidents has led to much controversy. On the one hand, increasing the driving age could reduce the number of accidents by inexperienced young people, but on the other hand, this solution is not sufficiently simple and does not deal with the basic causes of traffic accidents. The tendency for young people to drive dangerously in their first years of driving is well known, and the risk of accident increases as they gain experience. Driving at a higher age could have the unintended consequence of increasing the number of accidents by unqualified drivers. It is far more effective to improve driving instruction, improve road conditions and enforce stricter driving laws. In addition, it would be more effective to introduce a system of graduated licences, under which the privileges of the road are granted as a driver gains experience. This approach not only reduces the number of accidents by young people, but also improves the general safety of road users. With this system, the road will be safer for all road users, regardless of their age. A more general approach, which deals with the basic causes of accidents and creates a safe driving culture among all road users, is needed.
1366;Childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents (agree/disagree);"Childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion and include relevant examples.It is true that parents need some knowledge and experience in order to raise their in an appropriate way. In this regard, many families attend different training courses. While I agree that these courses might be useful for some of them, I totally disagree with the recommended obligatory of such training.On the one hand, training courses usually offered by governments could be very useful for those guardians who have a with special needs. For example, if a child has a birth defect or has been diagnosed with any mental or musculoskeletal disorders, these kinds of training could be lifesaving. Additionally, as we know, the first few months after birth are really a crucial period of a child’s life; parents should obtain different information related to their child’s vaccinations, common health problems, different developmental issues and so on, which can be delivered through such training courses.On the other hand, I believe that making these programs a mandatory option would cause several problems for societies and individuals as well. To begin with, in order to achieve this goal, many professionals should be trained which may not be affordable for some governments. From an individual’s point of view, this kind of programs could be very time-consuming for some families who have other at home or who work long hours. The other important consideration is that parent training courses may not provide all the necessary information for each and every family. To be more specific, parents could get more beneficial information through different websites such as YouTube according to their own preferences.In conclusion, although I believe that many families can take advantage training courses, I do believe that making them a compulsory option for everyone is too time and money-consuming for individuals and governments.The introduction is very good and relevant. The writer’s position is balanced, relevantly and properly developed in two body paragraphs. The conclusion summarizes both sides of the argument and logically finished the essay. To maintain the necessary level of formality the word ‘kids’ should be replaced with ‘children’ everywhere in this essay. The use of prepositions needs more attention as some are inappropriate or incorrect. The length could be reduced – it’s not necessary to write a very long essay to get a higher score, and often it is better to write a shorter essay (no shorter than 250 words though!) but spend more time proofreading, correcting errors and improving the quality of writing. Overall this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS."; I think that mandatory courses are ineffective. It may be seen as an intrusion of government into personal family matters. Although it is true that parenting is a serious responsibility and that parents should have the necessary skills to perform this duty, making such courses mandatory would not be the best solution. For one thing, not all parents may require or benefit from such courses. Parenting is a personal and individual matter and what works for one family may not be the best solution for another. As well, access, availability, and the potential added pressure to new parents may be problematic. In many cases, parents already have the necessary skills and knowledge to raise their children, through experience, education, or natural ability. It would be more beneficial to make such courses available and available to parents who feel they would benefit from them. This approach respects the autonomy of parents while still offering resources and support for those who require it. In addition, parents who struggle with the demands of parenting may feel that such a policy will reflect poorly on their parenting skills, which may affect their self-esteem and their sense of competence. However, a policy of voluntary participation and support will be better able to facilitate the development of a community that values and supports all parents in their unique role as parents.
1384;Children should be engaged in paid work, agree or disagree?;"In many countries children are engaged in different kinds of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?The issue of whether or not children should be engaged in some paid work has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that having some employment experience is conducive to a child’s learning and development, I contend that it would bring harm to the child’s and learning.First of all, a workplace designed for adults normally child-friendly facilities. Desks and chairs are too high for a child; the light switches are installed on the walls unreachable children; also emergency training and facilities such as phones are only provided to adults. Furthermore, various hazards such as polluted air and chemical fumes are still produced in factories and farms. Undoubtedly young people would suffer in such workplaces.Also, children would find it frustrating when they are not properly inducted before starting a job. A child working in a cement factory would feel a setback when he could not get immediate support while struggling with the procedures of recording different raw materials that required by the job. Further, without sufficient support, a child’s misunderstanding or inappropriately communicating with adults would only disappoint him and prevents him from active learning and interacting with other people.To conclude, a child’s paid employment experience would lead to a negative impact on their health and active learning. However, recognizing the importance of children’s learning and their awareness of responsibility, it is advisable to encourage them to be involved in some volunteering opportunities where they can meaningfully learn and interact with other people with sufficient care and support in place for such jobs.This is a good essay. There are only a few errors (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections), but otherwise this work seems worthy of Band 7.5 or 8. Remember to always proofread your essay before submitting it. Keep up the good work!"; There is a lot of discussion about this topic. Some argue that this can give children valuable skills and financial independence. I strongly disagree with that. There are several reasons for this. First, the child's primary responsibility is to attend classes and concentrate on their education. Paid work will be a distraction for them, which will lead to poor results and a lack of foundations. Secondly, paid work can lead to child abuse. Without supervision and restrictions, children can work in dangerous conditions, for long hours and for low wages. Children still need to play, rest and develop their physical and mental abilities. Thirdly, paid work deprives children of childhood, a very important period in their lives when they form their personalities, develop their social skills and emotional intelligence. In this case, children can become physically and emotionally ill, and lose their full potential. In my opinion, the solution is not to engage children in paid work. Children should not be taught to earn money at an early age, they should be taught useful skills for their future lives.
1383;Children these days are suffering from obesity, why and how can it be solved?;Modern children are suffering from the diseases that were once considered to be meant for adults only. Obesity is a major disease prevalent among children. What are its causes and what solutions can be offered?Nowadays, the increasing rate of overweight children and adults is a worldwide health issue. Obesity is a major problem which is increasing day by day in children. There are various reasons behind it. This essay will discuss the causes of obesity and offer some solutions.The first cause of obesity is junk food. It is often seen that mostly children are fond of burgers, pizzas, noodles and . These types of foods are easily available to them in school canteens. Children love to purchase chips, , ice-cream for lunch. Moreover, in this modern era, parents are working and they do not have time to cook at home. Parents often buy dinner for their children instead of preparing food at home. This calorie-rich diet is making children obese. This problem can be solved by teaching children to cook healthy foods for themselves and banning junk foods and fizzy drinks in schools. This diet can be replaced by milk, juice and fruits for lunch.The second cause of obesity is . It is true that the use of computers and television is increasing children. They spend most of their time watching television or playing video games on a computer. This technological advancement has reduced the level of physical activity in this specific age group. This issue can be resolved by encouraging children to do physical exercises. Parents can take their children to park to encourage playing with friends. Furthermore, schools can add sports in their curriculum to maintain physical fitness in their students.To sum up, it is clear that main causes of obesity are unhealthy eating and not enough physical activities. This ailment can be prevented and treated by healthy eating and physical exercises.This is a good essay. There are only a few minor errors that could have been easily prevented by proofreading this essay one last time before submission (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). Overall, this work seems worthy of IELTS Band 8. Keep up the good work!; In recent years, the number of obese children has risen sharply. The percentage of overweight children is now one in five. The combination of a sedentary life, unhealthy eating habits and lack of physical activity is causing this alarming trend. The spread of screens such as television, the Internet and smart phones has led to the fact that children spend more time on their backs. A major reason for childhood obesity is the consumption of junk food and sweet drinks. These are cheap and easily accessible foods that are aimed at children and are also advertised. So far, parents and carers have to play a very important role in promoting healthy eating and physical activity. Providing nutritious meals and reducing the time spent on screens and encouraging children to do sports and outdoor activities are some of the ways to address the issue. The government should also act by supporting physical education in schools and regulating the marketing of unhealthy foods to children. Schools can also play an important role by including health and physical education in the curriculum and by offering healthy meals in the canteen. Besides, schools should have more time for physical activity. In the end, it is up to us to prevent this from happening and give children a good start to a healthy and fulfilling life.
857;Competitiveness is a positive quality for people in most societies. How does competitiveness affect individuals? Is it a positive or negative trend?;Life is full of competition. Soon after the release from competitive university exams, the hard fighting for higher positions in a company will be waiting for you. While the competitiveness has been bringing us a convenient society, no small number of employments have been tired of never-ending competitions. No doubt about a positive effect on societies, but when we start to argue about the effect on individuals, it becomes more controversial. This essay will argue the drawbacks of competitiveness for individuals, especially from the perspective of Japanese modern society and typical Japanese office workers. I believe that cooperativeness and uniqueness are sometimes more important attitude than competitiveness.Firstly, competitiveness causes less diversity. If there is a competition, there must be the same evaluation metrics to differentiate winners and losers. The evaluation procedure needs to limit the metrics into specific aspects of the human being. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to prove that the metrics are proper for all of the possible cases and effective for the HR evaluation. For example, Japanese companies are likely to judge quantitatively based on the numbers related to performance. However, how can we evaluate the cooperativity or the non-quantitative performance like in creative jobs? Most Japanese companies adopted the HR evaluation methods based on average working hours per day and number of reports monthly. That’s why the Japanese tend to overwork to fulfill this requirement. In addition, as a result of placing more importance in quantity of reports, rather than quality, Japanese employees are prone to choose easy and short-term tasks or outsourcing instead of building by their own methods. This tendency causes fewer complicated and long-term tasks.Secondly, competitiveness causes less cooperativeness. Fewer people volunteer to play a disadvantageous role for smooth teamwork. Moreover, some people play an evil role by blaming or cheating the competitors in order to be superior to them. As a consequence, overall efficiency will decline and some people will be overestimated. Even if there are no problems temporarily, the long-lasting large companies will eventually become corrupt, and those who have the most political power, rather than real power, will remain at the top.Consequently, competitiveness is the basis of capitalism which brings us a brighter and more convenient society, however, biased evaluation and less cooperative working environment possibly drive people into nervous breakdowns. Karoshi, overwork death derived from too much stress and less sleeping, is one of the most serious social problems in Japan. We may need to rethink about the competitiveness.; On the one hand, the competition can make people work hard, achieve their goals, and raise their self-esteem. In most societies, competition is considered a good quality that pushes people to excel and surpass themselves. On the other hand, competition can make people feel a lot of stress. Besides, a competitive environment can foster a healthy rivalry between individuals who learn from each other’s strengths and weaknesses, and develop strategies to overcome their limitations. This can lead to personal growth, improved performance, and a feeling of achievement. The ability to compete also gives people the confidence to take risks, learn from mistakes, and build self-esteem, which are essential skills for success in many areas of life. It is also true that too much competition can be damaging to individuals, causing stress, anxiety, and an unhealthy focus on winning rather than learning and self-improvement. Finally, competition prepares people for the challenges of the real world, where they will face competition in their careers, education, and other areas of life. Competition can be a positive force in individuals’ lives, pushing them to achieve their full potential. However, to get the best out of life, it is essential to strike the right balance between competition and other values such as cooperation, empathy, and self-knowledge. Too much competition can make people place success above relationships, mental health, and well-being. Competition can be a powerful force for personal growth and success when it is used in a constructive way, but when it becomes an obsession, it can be damaging to individuals and society.
425;Computers are now the basis of the modern world. They should therefore be introduced into classrooms, and their programs used for direct teaching purposes. However, dependence on computers in teaching may carry a certain degree of risk to students.Discuss both sides and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Computers are presntly an integral part of the civilized world and are essential to daily living. Some individuals believe that they should be introduced into the classroom and used for teaching purposes while others are of the opinion that dependence on computers in teaching may pose a risk to students.Introducing computers and their programs in educational instuitions for learning purposes is a beneficial thing to students. The world is fast changing and students need to meet up and be at par with others in the world. The globe is becoming a more digital place and computers are the core of that, teaching using computers will open students' minds to new possibilitiies, faster approaches and more advanced ways of solving problems. A recent study showed that 75% of students who were taught using computers are currently more successful than others in their work places.It is understandable that people also think that dependence on computers in teaching may be detrimental to students. The students may become lazy and may not necessarily want to use their brains to calculate or understand things because the computer has already done that for them. Also using computers to learn in the school environment is also just adding to screen time for the learners; they are already being exposed to lots of wrong things at home adding school to it may not neceesarily the best option.Personally, students have a lot to learn using computers but truthfully speaking most of them already have the technological know how when it comes to using computers and if they actually want to learn more about how to use them, they can do so at home using the popular learning sites, it doesnt necessarily have to be introduced into the school learning system.In conclusion,computers are currently the foundation of the modern world and have their advantages and disadvantages, if they are put to the right use at the appropriate place and time, its benefits are beyond measure."; On the one hand, introducing a computer into the classroom can enhance the learning experience for students, because of the fact that their programs can make lessons much more interesting and help students learn complex lessons in a better way. In recent years, the use of computers in classrooms has been the subject of heated debate. However, the dependence of students on computers in the teaching process may carry a certain degree of risk. For example, the teaching program can create virtual laboratories where students can do experiments and research in a safe and controlled environment. In addition, the students can access the vast amount of information on the Internet and find their own. Furthermore, it can be used for non-academic purposes, such as social media and games. It has been shown that the students who used the computers in the classrooms spent more time on extra-academic activities than they did on learning. Besides, the excessive reliance on the computer can lead to the fact that people forget to develop basic skills, such as handwriting and calculation. In my opinion, it should be introduced into the classroom, but only in moderation and with a certain degree of control, because the development of basic skills is extremely important, and not the fact that the students must be able to use the machines. In addition, it can reduce the social and communication skills between teachers and students. There should be a balance between the use of new technology and the use of traditional methods. For example, a teacher can set a task for a group of students, in which the student must use the Internet for research, but also write a report on handwriting.
1329;Crime rates are likely to decline due to the advancements in technology, which will help prevent and solve crimes in an easier way. Do you agree or disagree?;"Nowadays technology is advancing faster than ever and many fields are benefitting from the opportunities this trend presents. Some think that crime prevention can be one possible application of new technologies, by allowing to deter offenders or solve crimes in a faster and easier way. In my opinion, innovation in crime prevention can be a game-changer that will reduce both the number of crimes committed and the time it takes to catch those responsible for them.Not everyone is optimistic about the prospects of the use of new technologies in crime prevention, and those who subscribe to the more pessimistic view say that advanced technologies can be accessed by criminals, therefore raising the crime rates. Such tools can, indeed, cause more damage if they fall in the wrong hands; however, it would require the offenders to be highly skilled to be able to use the modern technologies. Statistically, many of them tend to have a lower level of education, and for that reason they are likely to stick to the old ways of committing crimes, whereas the minority of highly skilled criminals are unlikely to make a big difference to the crime levels.Law enforcement workforce, on the other hand, has a much better grip on modern technology. Nowadays police officers and detectives undergo special training, take regular skill update courses, and use high-tech equipment. Facial recognition and thermal imaging are just two examples of the important tools that police are already using to find and catch offenders faster. Ordinary citizens can do their part in preventing burglaries by installing sophisticated systems with sensors, CCTV video feed and various alarms to detect and deter thieves. The combined effort will, no doubt, push the crime curve down.To sum up, even though the wonders of technology are available to everyone, it seems to me that they will better assist law enforcement in solving crimes, and law-abiding citizens in protecting themselves and their property, rather than felons. This will tip the balance in favour of reduction in crime rate and make the world a safer place."; In my opinion, I agree that technological advancements lead to a decline in crime rates, one of the main reasons being the improved capability of preventing and solving crimes. The idea that crime rates will decline due to technological advancements is a widely discussed topic. Such as the use of facial recognition and vehicle number plate readers, enabling criminals to be more easily caught, and the ability to study big data to predict and prevent potential crime hotspots, enabling police to do more accurate and effective policing. Through the development of technology such as surveillance cameras, artificial intelligence and data analysis, police forces have better capabilities to monitor and monitor crime. With this increased capability, there is a good chance of deterring potential criminals and reducing crime rates. In addition, citizens have been empowered to help prevent and report crimes. With the development of mobile phone applications and other information platforms, individuals have become easier to report and provide information to the authorities. The benefits of technology in preventing and solving crimes outweigh the disadvantages, and it is a trend that will continue to increase. However, it is necessary to recognize that technology can also create new opportunities for criminals, such as cybercrime and fraud. And so on. So in the end, technology must be used by the police and the public.
1363;Dieting can change a person’s life for better or worse (from Target Band ;This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskDieting can change a person’s life for the better or ruin one’s health completely. What is your opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsSome argue that dieting has an extraordinary impact on one’s life, whereas others are of a view that it absolutely adversely affects a person’s health. It cannot be denied that dieting taken to extremes may cause more harm than good, however, in my opinion effective dieting is pivotal for maintaining good health and keeping a more attractive body shape.First of all, the possibility of increasing level of physical health lies with incorporating proper dieting in our lives. It is reasonable to suggest that dieting is effective for controlling our body weight within an ideal range in order to achieve the normal score of body mass index (BMI), which is essential for preventing us from overweight or obese. As a result, the risk of suffering an illness will be reduced. A recent research concluded that dieting is one of the most effective measures to cut down one’s body weight among the obese group, and it helps to improve their medical condition indirectly.Moreover, dieting is crucial for keeping ideal body features regardless of gender and age. A fit and presentable body outlook absolutely boosts up one’s level in his or her social life, not to mention professions that require keeping one’s body in an attractive physical shape. For example, dieting is adopted as a popular way for reducing weight among actors and actresses. A recent article reported that an actress who successfully regained her slim body after a period of dieting was offered an excellent job opportunity in the Hollywood film industry.In conclusion, in my opinion dieting has a positive influence on one’s life in terms of maintaining a profound level of health and keeping a more attractive body outlook.The writer’s opinion is very clear from the start and throughout the entire essay. Paragraphing is used effectively to organise ideas and information. The use of advanced vocabulary enables accuracy of expression and highlights flexibility. Overall, the control of grammar and punctuation is good, with only a few errors made. The essay is a good example of an IELTS Band 8 work.;" 1). A well-planned diet can have a profoundly positive effect on a person's life. The old adage ""You are what you eat"" is a fair assessment of how food affects our health, and it is difficult to judge whether a diet is good or bad for a person. On the one hand, if you approach a diet in the wrong way, it can have negative consequences. A balanced and nourishing diet can make you lose weight, give you more energy and make you more alert. A healthy diet can also help reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, and thus increase life expectancy and quality of life. But if a person starts a diet for the wrong reasons, it can lead to eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, and to a constant need to have an ideal body that is unhealthy. Also, the constant pressure to look a certain way can lead to poor self-esteem, anxiety and depression. In conclusion, a diet can change a person's life for better or worse, depending on how it is approached. A well-planned diet can lead to improved physical and mental health, but a distorted and excessive diet can have severe and long-lasting consequences. A balanced and sustainable diet that focuses on gradual change of life rather than short-term fad diets is therefore the best way forward. If you start a diet with this in mind, you can make sure your diet is a positive and life-changing experience."
1417;Dieting can change a person’s life for the better or ruins one’s health completely. What is your opinion?;Almost of the women today want a beautiful figure. That is why we are able to find a diet programme almost everywhere in the country. Most of the women have and gone on a diet before either to or just health problem.A proper diet programme will help you not only to slim down but also to have a eating habits. For instance more vegetables and fruits meat, fried food and carbonated drinks. For a diet programme we shouldn’t food and water. There are some diet programmes from the doctors that help you to have a heart like the “Three day diet” which we can find on the Internet. This programme allows you to eat fruits and also some meat. This way of dieting will help you to avoid some of the health problems in the future like or a heart attack.However some people do not only go on a diet but they avoid eating and hungry for the whole day. All they have is just either water or juices. Also there people who buy special diet programmes over the counter which are not approved by the health department and they are doing so without consulting a doctor first. They do not follow the basic rules of dieting and this will lead them to some serious health problems like of some body parts or, even worse, death.In my opinion there is wrong with going on a diet as long as we follow the correct way of eating and .; My opinion is that dieting can have a two-edged blade and it can either improve a person’s life or completely destroy it. On the one hand, a well-planned, balanced diet can be the source of many benefits, such as weight loss, an increase in energy, and the prevention of such chronic illnesses as diabetes and heart disease. The old saying “You are what you eat” is not in vain: diets can seriously affect one’s health. Such crash diets can lead to malnutrition, dehydration, and imbalances of mineral and electrolyte salts, which can cause a host of serious health problems. On the other hand, strict and extreme diets can have devastating consequences for the human organism. On the mental side, a balanced diet can improve the mood and give rise to greater self-esteem and a sense of self-confidence. It is obvious that such diets, lacking in important nutrients, can weaken the immune system and make a person more susceptible to various illnesses. The answer to the question is balance. It is essential to approach dieting from a more holistic perspective, giving priority to health and general well-being over rapid weight loss or aesthetic goals. This way, dieting can have a positive effect on a person’s life and a long, healthy and happy life. Such a diet should consist of a variety of natural foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean meats. A person should eat such a quantity of these foods that he or she is unable to eat more. It is essential to approach dieting with caution and with a proper understanding of the complex relationships between food, the human body and mental state.
1409;Dieting can change a person’s life for the better or ruins one’s health completely. What’s your opinion?;Dieting seems to be of our life in this modern society, especially for those who are health conscious. Different people choose different type of dieting methods, trying to achieve what they believe to be good for either their health or physical appearance. In general, most of the people who diet are focusing on controlling their weight.In our urban society, most of the working class not have the opportunity to consume . Their daily meals consist of fast food which contains large amounts of fat and salt. The most significant of this unhealthy lifestyle is the weight gain especially among those middle age working professionals.Therefore, most of these young and energetic people have to control their diet in order to stay in shape either for their appearance or health. The most common and proper method of maintaining one’s weight is eating less oily food, preferably more green vegetables, fruits and alcohol.However, some have resorted to losing weight by taking their diet to the extreme, not eating at all for days. Others will make themselves vomit after each meal. Many others will go for dieting medication and beverages that help them to lose their appetite. These unhealthy will cause internal damage in the long run.In my opinion, dieting for better health is more important than solely for looking attractive. Individuals who wish to control their weight should seek professional if they are unable to reduce their weight after switching over to a healthy diet for a period of time. Losing weight and losing your health at the same time does not benefit any individual.This essay needs some work. The first body paragraph explains the reason people have for dieting, whereas it should explain what are the advantages or the dangers of it. The second body paragraph explains how to diet, whereas it should present arguments for or against dieting. Therefore, the task is only partially covered here.; I think dieting is indeed a double-edged sword that can change a person’s life for the better or ruins his health completely. In my opinion, dieting is indeed a double-edged sword that can change a person’s life for the better or ruins his health completely. On the one hand, dieting can also have disastrous consequences if it is not approached sensibly and sustainably. Dieting can lead to significant weight loss, higher energy and better health. In addition, the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and some types of cancer is reduced, which in turn increases life expectancy and the quality of life. However, in the end, the key to successful dieting is a balanced and sustainable approach to healthy eating. Extreme diets, crash diets and other forms of extreme dieting can lead to malnutrition, eating disorders and other health problems. On the other hand, it can lead to constant pressure to conform to the standards of social beauty and the cult of thinness, resulting in psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety and a low self-esteem. People who are interested in a long-term relationship with food and self-nourishment instead of following the fads of the moment can unlock many of the positive effects of dieting while reducing the risks and ensuring a healthier, happier and more successful life.
1323;Discipline is a growing problem in modern schools. Some people think that parents should discipline their own children, while others think it should be the responsibility of the government. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;While some people argue that parents should take sole responsibility for disciplining their children, others take the view that the government should be in charge of such matters. In my opinion, the young generation should be primarily guided by their parents where rules of behavior and moral principles are concerned. However, in some instances government intervention is necessary.On one side of the argument, there are people who hold the opinion that the responsibility of disciplining a child falls squarely on parents’ shoulders, since they are their first educators, and it is their duty to equip their children with good manners and morals even before their first day at school. In addition, every family has a unique understanding of what a suitable form of discipline entails. Therefore, some parents are concerned that any form of punishment meted out at school might be too harsh. To overcome this issue, they believe that parents should be informed by the school of their child’s wrongdoing so that they could decide an appropriate consequence for their behavior at home.Unfortunately, not all parents are objective enough to make the right decisions when it comes to the upbringing of their children. Some may lack information or sound moral background to discipline their children in a meaningful way. Therefore, the state should shoulder some of the responsibility by implementing a strict set of guidelines and policies on how to discipline children at school. I believe that such policies result in children who flourish and are more likely to become productive citizens that actively contribute to a prosperous nation. Also, this would help both parents and teachers understand which punishments are suitable for minor infractions like missing an assignment or major incidents like bullying or skipping school.In conclusion, while both views are commonly held in society, I believe that the government must be actively involved in the policies related to discipline at schools as this would ensure the well-being and successful development of the youth.; In this essay, I would like to discuss both views and give my opinion. The first view is that parents should control the education of their children. It is believed that parents know their children best and are the most suitable person to raise and educate them. Parents are responsible for their children and they should be held accountable for their behavior. On the other hand, some people think that it should be the government's responsibility to discipline children in schools. This view is based on the idea that schools reflect society and that government should be able to ensure children learn in a safe and respectful environment. The second view is that the government should control discipline in schools. This view is based on the idea that although parents have a major role in educating their children, the government is also responsible for creating a safe and supportive learning environment. In my opinion, I think that discipline should be a shared responsibility between parents and the government. Ultimately, a shared responsibility between parents and the government is essential for the healthy and safe development of children in schools today.
1066;Eating sweet foods produces acid in the mouth, which can cause tooth decay. (High acid levels are measured by low pH values)Describe the information below and discuss the implications for dental health.;The given graph shows the level of acidity in the mouth from consuming food that contains fruit or cane sugar and honey.To start with, if we take a look at honey-consistent food, we will notice that the acid level increases within the first 5 minutes. After that, the level of acidity remains at the rate of less than 5 pH, and, then goes down to a normal level. So, it is unlikely tooth decay to occur within such a short period of time.Regarding fruit and cane sugar-consistent food, it is quite noticeable that the acidity level increases dramatically at a level of less than 5.5 pH and 4.5 pH, respectively. However, the main difference between fruit and cane sugar is that the acid level of fruit sugar decreases within a bit more than 15 minutes. In contrast to it, the acid level of cane sugar goes down to a normal level within more than 25 minutes, which is more likely to get tooth decay.; When you eat sweet foods, bacteria in your mouth break them down into acids, which makes the pH value drop. This increase in acidity can lead to tooth decay, a disease in which tooth enamel deteriorates and cavities develop. You can stay with a low pH for a long time, depending on what you eat, and how you brush your teeth. A study showed that after eating sweets the pH of the mouth can fall to a value of 3. Some people think that if you brush your teeth regularly you will have a lower pH value and fewer cavities. There is no doubt that good oral hygiene, including regular brushing and flossing, and avoiding sweet foods and drinks, are very important for the prevention of dental decay. In addition, the regular consumption of sweets can aggravate the development of tooth sensitivity and gum disease. Aware of the connection between eating sweet foods and acid production, people can prevent cavities and other diseases. Visit your dentist regularly for regular dental checkups and cleaning to prevent serious diseases.
1362;Education in financial management should be a mandatory component of the school program, agree/disagree (from Target Band ;This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskEducation in financial management should be a mandatory component of the school program. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsMore and more young adults in our country are heavily indebted. Thus, it is considered by some that it should be mandatory to educate school children the administration of money. In my opinion, people should not leave school without a sound knowledge of financial management.To begin with, a country’s development is strongly upon the purchasing capacity of its inhabitants. That is to say, people who are in debt or financially vulnerable, would not be able to spend freely or invest, for example, in a new house, thus hindering the economic growth of the country. As a consequence, the rate of inflation would rise and people would be able to afford even less, which could ultimately result in the collapse of the entire economy. A good example of this vicious circle can be seen in countries such as Argentina, where people have to buy household items in the black market, because they cannot afford to buy them in regular stores due to skyrocketing prices. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to teach children early money management.Another point to consider is the low standard of living that people have when they mismanage their finances. Individuals who are constantly short of money could eventually end up being socially isolated and unhappy, because they couldn’t afford to participate in leisure activities, such as going to the cinema with a friend, resulting in their from social life. However, this could be avoided with ease by offering courses in money management.In conclusion, I strongly believe that school children should be taught how to manage their finances to prevent social isolation later in their life as well as to maintain the economic force of their country.The writer’s position is clear throughout the essay. Paragraphing is used effectively to organise ideas and information, however the paragraphs could have been balanced better in terms of the amount of content. The advanced vocabulary the writer uses creates a good impression of mature and fluent writer. Overall, the control of grammar and punctuation is fine, and the number of errors is small. The essay could achieve Band 8 in IELTS.; I, page 86). I strongly agree that education in financial management should be mandatory in schools. In today's complex and constantly changing financial world, it is extremely important for people to have a good understanding of their personal finances and the ability to manage their own finances. The students will learn the basic skills of budgeting, saving and investing, which they will then use throughout their lives. Students will also be able to make good decisions about student loans, credit cards and other financial products, which will help them avoid common traps and financial difficulties. Many young people leave school without any basic knowledge of how to manage their finances, which can lead to very bad decisions and a lifetime of debt. Therefore, financial management should be a mandatory subject in schools to promote financial stability and responsibility among young people. In addition, financial education in schools will have a positive impact on the wider society. By giving students a solid foundation in financial management, we can help them to make good decisions about their finances and set them up for a life of financial success. This, in turn, will have a positive impact on the individuals, on the society and on the economy, which can lead to a more stable and prosperous future. In conclusion, I firmly believe that education in financial management should be mandatory in schools.
1421;Even though Globalization affects the world’s economics in a very positive way, its negative sides should not be forgotten. Discuss.;Everything has sides in the world, and so has the of globalization . The effects of globalization on the world economy are .We must acknowledge that the negative effects are from a different kind than the positive ones. the negative sides, like low in less developed countries are important to .If we take the Eurozone for example, the economic changes the process are huge. Many companies have transferred their factories into cheaper production to in the world . The results are rising unemployment rates in the “old industrial countries”.In regard to the other countries on the world market, such as China, this job transfer is a big opportunity. But no one can that the consequences for the less developed countries where economy flourished, based on availability of cheap employees are highly important: globalization based on this facts brings problems.Nevertheless, there are also . In general it is remarkable that there is a new tendency in “Thinking Global”. For instance, people are willing to more languages and get educated about cultures. Countries as undeveloped, such as India, are getting chances to be the in a certain field.All in all it can be said that the effects of globalization are enormous. The of economic processes has changed completely. It is important to think in bigger terms, not just about the country. The positive things that this globalization process have brought us for the negative sides. The should be a world in balance, but this has yet to come.; The evolution of globalization has had a profound effect on the world economy, which has brought with it the growth and interconnectedness of nations on an unprecedented scale. The positive and negative sides of globalization are obvious and cannot be ignored. One of the important drawbacks is the widening gap between the rich and the poor. Despite the fact that the economic growth has increased, the living standards of people have improved and poverty has been reduced in many countries, some people are still living in extreme poverty and they have no access to basic amenities, such as clean water and electricity. Also, globalization has resulted in the decline of local industry, which has lost its competitiveness and is unable to compete with large, international companies. As a result, the uniqueness of local customs and traditions are being lost in the face of dominant international brands. Besides, as a result of cheap labor and raw materials, multinational companies have taken advantage of the weak economies of developing countries and exploited the labor force, which has further widened the gap between the rich and the poor and has increased social and economic inequalities. On the other hand, the rapid economic growth has led to the exploitation of natural resources and the loss of bio-diversity, which has increased the threat to the stability of the eco-system. Moreover, it has been criticized for its harmful effects on the environment. The increase in the transport of goods and services has increased the production of greenhouse gases and has led to climate change. One must take into account both the benefits and drawbacks of globalization if we are to create a more equitable and prosperous world. It is essential that we recognize and tackle these problems in order to ensure that the benefits of globalization are shared more evenly and fairly.
1319;Even though experts believe that walking is a great way to improve one’s health, very few people walk nowadays. Why aren’t people walking? What can be done to encourage them to walk more?;The benefits of walking are numerous, and experts recommend it as a good way to keep healthy and fit. Despite this, the number of people who walk on a daily basis is on the decline. The reasons for this are manifold, but there are also several solutions that may help people walk more.Lack of time is the most common reason people cite for not engaging in any form of physical activity. These days most people have hectic schedules that involve juggling their work and home responsibilities. As a result, they are often too exhausted or pressed for time and therefore opt for faster and more comfortable forms of transport, such as cars, bikes or public transport. Another major reason for the reduced number of pedestrians on the roads is a lack of safety. Most full-time workers are not free to walk during the day, and will skip it in the evenings or early morning hours, if they do not feel safe enough to do so.Fortunately, there are quite a few solutions to this issue. One is making walkers safe, which means the government should ensure that there are enough sidewalks and streetlights available in every suburb, so that pedestrians can walk or jog safely whenever time allows. Another useful option is to create special walking tracks and parks in neighbourhoods where people can get some much-needed exercise in the evenings. The added benefit of promoting the healthy lifestyle and walking in the community makes this solution even more attractive.To conclude, the pressures of daily life and lack of safely while walking reduce the popularity of this healthy practice. Governments can reverse this trend by creating more green spaces for people to walk in and addressing their safety concerns.;" This is largely due to the fact that people are becoming more and more dependent on technology and transportation. Since the invention of cars, buses and trains, people have become used to the quick and easy ways of getting from one place to another, and this has made them forget about the simplest and most effective way of getting from one place to another—walking. One of the main reasons for this is that in many cities there is not enough space for pedestrians; the sidewalks are either in poor condition or nonexistent, making it difficult and dangerous for people to walk. Modern sedentary jobs, which require people to sit for long periods of time, also contribute to the reduction of walking. The governments can play an important role by providing safer and more pleasant conditions for pedestrians, including the sidewalks, bicycle lanes and pedestrian crossings. In addition, the popularity of entertainment on the Internet and social media has created a situation where people prefer to stay indoors instead of doing physical activity, like walking. Walking more can be encouraged by simply introducing walking into people’s daily routines. People can walk instead of taking the bus during their lunch break, or walk to the store instead of driving. Besides, the governments should promote walking to work or schools and establish “Walk to work” or “Walk to school” days to raise awareness of the benefits of walking and promote the culture of physical activity. In conclusion, it is essential that people appreciate the value of walking and promote the walking culture."
1410;Even though globalization affects the world’s economy in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. Discuss.;Everything has two sides and the globalization is not exception. Our first thoughts about this topic include the process of global “McDonaldisation” and, generally speaking, spreading across the whole Globe.Firstly, I would try to concentrate on the positive aspects of globalisation. As far as economy is concerned, like the Global Bank or IMF are always focused on developing the ‘Third World’ and helping poor people to combat their life obstacles (through loans and donations). Moreover, the world becomes an area of sharing thoughts (e.g. philosophical or economical doctrines), which become popular due to lack of barriers.However, disadvantages of globalization are also widely known. Some people insist that because of this process, the spirit of countries and nations rapidly disappears. The integrity, established years ago is on the verge of collapsing. Furthermore, there’s a strong lobby of communists who , that the globalization indicates an uncontrolled reign of capitalists and slave work of lower labour-class. We should never forget about the detrimental impact of global investments on the environment – the green house effect or soar rains are triggered by globalization.To sum up, globalization has both positive and negative influence on our everyday life. I can’t agree with the popular statement that we should try to avoid being affected by it. However, we must not forget about our surroundings and local communities. They have a great value which should last forever.; Certainly, globalization has had a great influence on the economy of the world, helping the free movement of goods, services, and ideas, which has led to an increase in the production of goods, employment, and cultural exchange. However, despite all these advantages, the negative side should not be ignored. One of the major disadvantages of globalization is the increase in the gap between the rich and the poor. As a result, many countries have seen a significant increase in economic growth, and millions of people have been lifted out of poverty and have improved their standards of living. However, the expansion of global corporations has led to the devastation of the environment and the homogenization of the population. As large companies expand, small industries and local businesses are less able to compete and thus lose their jobs, which leads to a decrease in employment and increases in income inequality. Moreover, the dominance of Western culture has threatened the identity of many societies, causing them to lose their traditional habits and customs. In conclusion, although globalization has brought many economic benefits, its disadvantages should not be ignored. It is important for governments, companies, and individuals to work together to minimize the negative effects of globalization and to promote a more equitable and sustainable economy. It is vital that these problems are acknowledged and dealt with in order for the benefits of globalization to be shared equally and sustainably.
1306;Every household should have a government-imposed limit on the amount of rubbish it can throw away. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"The amount of waste people produce can be quite shocking, with every person generating kilograms of rubbish in a single day, and all this can be difficult to manage. This has given some people the idea that there should be a limitation on the amount of rubbish produced per household; however, opinions are divided as to whether this would be the the most effective option.Having a limitation on the amount of waste produced sounds like a fine solution to a significant problem, with over two hundred and fifty million tons being generated in 2016 by the U.S. alone. Taxing households that break limits would push people to produce less waste and make them more mindful of what can be recycled or composted. However, forcing people to produce less waste might not be attainable.Households produce as much waste as they need to live their lifestyles. The waste people generate is only a result of the products they purchase, and will most likely wish to continue to purchase. Taxing people may be a cause of resentment, with many of them already struggling to pay their usual bills. In addition, if people produce more than they are allowed, this will encourage littering and dumping, so that they are not caught with more waste than entitled, and this in turn will damage the environment.Though controlling the amount of waste produced is important, there could be other ways of encouraging lesser output. In my opinion, governments should encourage composting and recycling, which will also reduce wasted material. People should also be more aware of what waste they produce and how it can be reduced. An education drive on these issues would perhaps be more likely to succeed in reducing rubbish than imposing limitations."; In my opinion, I partially agree with the idea of limiting rubbish because it could be beneficial for the environment and public health. In recent years there has been a great deal of discussion about whether there should be a limit on how much rubbish each household is allowed to throw away. Some people say that it would protect the environment and others that it would infringe people's freedom. By setting limits, households will be encouraged to reduce, reuse and re-use rubbish, which will lead to a cleaner and healthier environment. On the one hand, setting limits on rubbish could reduce the amount of waste that ends up in a waste bin, which is a major source of greenhouse gases and pollution. For example, Japan and Sweden have implemented a very successful system of waste management that mainly uses composting and biodegradable materials, which has reduced the amount of rubbish in the bin. In addition, a new system of waste management requires large financial and educational investments, which would be costly and time consuming. On the other hand, imposing strict limits on rubbish may not be practical or effective for all households. Families with a large number of children may be in difficult circumstances because of the lack of disposal options and may even resort to illegal dumping. In my opinion, the government should encourage households to reduce rubbish and offer them the opportunity to dispose of it in an environmentally friendly way without imposing limits on them. In conclusion, although I agree that limiting rubbish can be beneficial for the environment, a more moderate approach is needed. In addition, the needs and possibilities of households should be taken into account in order to create a more effective and equitable waste management system.
1406;Every year an increasing number of students choose to go to another country for their higher education. Do you think the benefits of this development outweigh the problems associated with it?;The past twenty years have seen a dramatic change the number of students who go abroad . In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of this trend.On the one hand, both students and their country can benefit from this trend. First, students can choose more suitable methods for themselves because there are more options. The and teaching methods are quite different . According to foreign experts, Secondly, people can improve their foreign language, they can contact with when they are in a foreign country, and they quickly master the foreign language. Thirdly, it helps to promote the mutual understanding between their mother land and their destination countries. These students exchange information with the locals. Students can get better understanding of the countries. People in their home country will get more vivid information about other countries . Similarly, the locals also can get more clear recognition about other countries.On the other hand, there are disadvantages too. Firstly, it costs people a lot of money to begin college in foreign countries. Many families have to take out all their savings to support their children abroad. Secondly, some students cannot stand the big difference the new environment, they quit their study and come back home.To conclude, given the fact that in foreign countries helps students with their studies and promotes the mutual understanding countries, even if there are some drawbacks, I think the benefits outweigh the problems.; In my opinion, the benefits of this development far outweigh the problems associated with it. Every year, more and more students choose to go abroad for higher education. There has been a debate on whether the advantages of studying abroad outweigh the disadvantages. The benefits are numerous, for example, to learn a new language, learn a new culture, and get a new perspective on life, which will make students independent and successful in their careers. On the other hand, there are also some problems associated with studying abroad, such as loneliness, cultural shock and financial difficulties. However, with proper planning, preparation and support from parents and friends, these problems can be overcome. Many foreign universities also have world-class faculties, modern equipment and famous professors, which are very attractive to students who want to get the best education. In addition, the knowledge and experience gained from studying abroad will be a great asset to the students in the future, which will give them a lot of opportunities in their careers. To sum up, although there are some problems associated with studying abroad, I still think the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. It is a life-changing experience that can change people's careers. So, I think students should be encouraged to go abroad for higher education.
1305;Everybody today should pay a small amount from their income in order to help people who are homeless and / or suffering great poverty. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Homelessness and poverty is a terrible but topical issue in both more economically advanced and less industrialised countries. To deal with this, many people feel that a small proportion of everyone’s income should be used to aid the homeless and poor. This could create more opportunities and change the lives of many disadvantaged people for the better.Though there are certain facilities such as shelters and soup kitchens to aid the poor and homeless, it is clear that this is not enough. In the U.S. alone, a very developed country in itself, nearly two million people are homeless. These facilities can lend a helpful hand; however, they do not help eradicate the problem. Those people who are homeless or poor can have trouble finding jobs, or, if they are lucky to gain employment, the pay may not be enough to support them and their families.If a small percentage of everyone’s income was used to help build more aid facilities and fund organisations to help the homeless and poor, the suffering of many people could be alleviated. However, this is not a perfect world, and taxes are high enough for many people. A similar argument could be that a portion of the taxes already paid to the government should then be set aside for this cause, but of course government funds are usually stretched to breaking point as it is, as governments have so many financial responsibilities already.Though the fundamental idea that people should pay a small percentage of their income to help the homeless and poor is admirable, it is unlikely that enough people would agree to it. People need all the money they earn after taxes anyway and, although governments already have too many calls on their available funds, in my view they should prioritise support payments for the homeless.";" In my opinion, I support the motion. The fact that everyone should contribute a small part of their income to help people who are homeless and / or in great need has given rise to a controversial debate. But in my opinion, it is a good idea to help people who are in need. Firstly, the little people would have to give up would be a very small sacrifice compared to the significant positive changes that could be made to the lives of homeless people and those in extreme poverty. For example, the collected money could be used to establish and maintain homes, give food, clothes and make people who suffer from homelessness regain their dignity and independence. This would be a sign of unity and shared responsibility between the citizens and would encourage them to engage in voluntary work and care for their fellow citizens. Secondly, this would contribute to a greater sense of community and social responsibility among citizens. It is important, however, that the money collected should be used properly and wisely. In Finland, for example, Helsinki has introduced the concept of ""housing first"" to reduce homelessness by providing permanent housing for homeless people before addressing their other needs. In conclusion, although there are some practical and administrative difficulties to overcome, the advantages of using the public's small, but regular financial contribution to support homeless people and those in extreme poverty outweigh the disadvantages. Transparency and accountability for how this money is used and distributed is important for the sake of public confidence and the effectiveness of the initiative. But with a shared effort and contribution, we can make sure that no one is left out in our prosperity and well-being. It is not only a moral obligation, but it is also a pragmatism that makes a more equal and compassionate society."
1407;Financial education should be a mandatory component of the school program. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;In many countries the discussion about financial education getting more serious due to financial problems of young generation. Some people that financial education should be considered a mandatory subject at school.The common problem for those young people is that they don’t know how to spend money in right way. As we can see many advertisements often carry out the message, “Only 10 dollars a week, no deposits” which is misleading think that living in debt is normal. Financial education is one of the solutions for . The basic idea of financial education as a core school subject is to teach those young ones to understand the concept of using money and to estimate a risk of borrowing money to buy something in the future.However, another factor we need . In my opinion, the role of financial education is getting more important and it should be a part of the school program but the parents are also important and have responsibility to how to manage the money. More than 70% of young people’s money is from their parents. In addition, it has to be considered that a student might become person, talking about money all the time in class or even in a public place. It can be harmful for some students and affect their normal social life.In conclusion, I that financial education will have a positive effect on all young ones and other such social commutations should be considered just as important as financial education.; I agree to a large extent that financial education should be part of the curriculum. In today's complex and constantly changing financial world, it is necessary that the student be able to manage his finances. By making financial education part of the curriculum, students will learn basic skills such as budgeting, saving, investing and avoiding common financial mistakes. Many young people, not having a proper financial education, are at the mercy of their own finances, and often make mistakes that are expensive for them. They get in debt, they make bad investment decisions, and they struggle to achieve long-term goals. Furthermore, financial education will encourage entrepreneurship, innovation and growth as the student is able to make wise financial decisions and take calculated risks. Finally, financial education can also positively affect the development of society. An educated person is less likely to make unwise financial decisions, and therefore less likely to become a victim of financial crisis and to rely on the state. In short, I think financial education should be a mandatory component of the curriculum, as it is necessary for achieving financial stability, economic growth and a well-functioning society. Although it may be argued that financial education is not a classic academic subject, I believe that it is an important part of a well-rounded education. For a well-educated person is better equipped to make long-term decisions and achieve financial security.
1404;Full time university students spend most of the time studying. They should be doing other activities too. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Full time study in university is a great experience in life but in parallel to that students other activities such as working for their pocket money, sports, participating in debates and . People differ in their opinion if students must in other things or stay concentrated on their studies only. The discussion will be presented below, followed by my opinion.Some people say that mere studying does not youth for a country. This way, students only earn theoretical knowledge not practical. For instance, students can be their studies but at the same time when they , they fail and cannot develop their confidence and work as brilliantly as they were in university. Hence, the best approach for them to be engaged here and there for practical experience.On the other hand, others believe that building a better career is the foremost thing in today’s world. So, they are targeted to their studies and gain as much knowledge as they can. Furthermore, if they are diverted from their studies, they will not be able to their .In my point of view, there must be blending of full time education and extra activities. It refreshes students’ minds and provides more energy . Moreover, by this way, they will learn how to with other people in the society.To summarize, it can be said that it is important to concentrate on but on the other hand there must be something to keep active and relaxed being involved in games, music, work and other extra activities.; On the one hand, it is obvious that the study is the core of university life, and students must allocate sufficient time to attend classes, lectures and study assignments. However, I partially disagree with this statement. While the academic pursuit is the main purpose of the university, it should be balanced with other activities to achieve the ideal balance and to achieve the ideal of personal development. Besides, university is a critical period for the acquisition of knowledge, the formation of professional skills, and the intellectual growth of the individual, and learning is an indispensable part of university life. On the one hand, the pursuit of academic excellence is often the first priority of university students, and they must study hard in order to get a good grade and satisfy the requirements of professors and parents. However, learning is the first and most important, and other activities, such as sports, volunteer work and other activities, can not only help students develop valuable life skills such as communication, self-discipline and time management, but also provide a space for students to relax and reduce their pressure, so as to achieve the ideal of work and life balance. In the end, it can be seen that, while learning is an important part of university life, other activities should also be given priority in order to achieve a well-rounded development.
1293;Having a salaried job is better than being self-employed. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;If one wants to work for money, there are really only two options, working for someone else for a salary and being self-employed. Most people are involved with these two options and they both have advantages and disadvantages.Being self-employed means that the worker owns the business that is being done. This might be a small one-person business or a large company with hundreds of employees. The first advantage of this is the capacity to earn more money. If the business does very well, the income can be considerable and the owner of the company will receive the benefits. On the other hand, if business is not good, the owner’s income will be low. Self-employed people also have the benefit to some extent of choosing their working hours and holidays and they have the right to change anything within their business. With this autonomy, however, comes the pressure to succeed and the reliance on one’s employees, if there are any, to do their best to make the business thrive.Salaried workers do not experience the same stress as the self-employed owners of companies. They might have stress in their duties, but the pressure that comes with keeping one’s own business operating successfully in order to support oneself and one’s family is just not felt by an employee. The employee also has a certain knowledge of his or her income, as the salary is usually fixed every month. The self-employed owner’s income often depends on how successful the business is. The employee’s fixed income, however, does not give much scope for earning large amounts more. In addition, an employee does not have the freedoms of the owner or the autonomy, and for many people, having control over their lives is a significant factor to their well-being.It is certain that there are advantages and disadvantages for both being self-employed and salaried. I personally disagree that being salaried is better than being self-employed. I prefer the autonomy that being self-employed brings and, although there is more risk and pressure, this can lead to greater and more fulfilling rewards.; In my opinion, I partly agree with this statement, as salaried positions and self-employment both have their own advantages and disadvantages. Salary versus self-employment is an ongoing debate. Some argue that salaried positions are more secure and stable than self-employment. Others, however, argue that the freedom and the possibility of unlimited earnings far outweigh the advantages of a salaried position. For example, a person who has a family to support and is interested in certainty and predictability might choose to work in a salaried position to guarantee that he will always be able to provide for his family. On the other hand, salaried positions are generally more stable and often offer more security than self-employment. Self-employed people can pursue their interests and create their own schedules and in some cases earn an unlimited income. In addition, salaried positions often offer the possibility of advancing in the company, receiving additional training and meeting people with similar interests, which can have long-term benefits for the company. Self-employment can also offer a sense of achievement and personal satisfaction that salaried positions may not offer. Finally, the decision to become self-employed depends on the personal circumstances and priorities of the individual. Many famous entrepreneurs such as Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg have become successful by starting their own business. The choice between salaried positions and self-employment ultimately depends on the personal preferences of the individual, the needs of the company and its long-term goals. Salary positions offer security and stability, while self-employment offers the freedom and unlimited earnings potential.
1339;High-rise vs. low-rise buildings, which solution is better for a growing population?;Some cities create new housing for their growing populations by constructing a smaller number of high-rise buildings. Other cities create more of low-rise buildings. Which solution is better, in your opinion?Sample EssayRising population in urban areas leaves governments with no choice but to build more houses to meet the demand. However, when it comes to construction, there is more than one way to build new homes. Some cities prefer to construct fewer residential towers, while others build a larger number of low-rises for their residents. In this essay both options will be discussed and a viable solution will be suggested.One advantage of tall buildings is that they can accommodate a large number of people while having a small footprint. This type of construction is popular in central city areas where land is scarce and expensive. For example, in New York City high-rise buildings have significantly reduced housing problems, by as much as 55% in the last few years. As a result of this strategy, rents tend to decrease which has a further positive impact on the economies of such cities. However, tall buildings offer little or no privacy, they force certain rules and regulations upon residents, and attract higher maintenance costs.Given a chance to voice their opinion, many individuals would prefer to live in low-rise buildings or even build their own houses. This option might be more attractive for big families and for older generation people who like to have their own personal space. Accessibility is also a concern for the elderly as taking the stairs when the lifts break down may not be an option for them. In addition, one or two-story houses are easier and cheaper to maintain compared to modern apartment towers. The downside of this type of dwellings is that they occupy much more land, and since land is cheaper on city fringes, new estates tend to be built away from city centres. This increases commute time to work for their residents and negatively affects their quality of life.In conclusion, high-rise and low-rise buildings have their unique advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, high rises are more suitable for younger residents and should be built in the areas where young population is prevalent, closer to the city centre and employment opportunities. Senior citizens should have a supply of lower dwellings available in quieter locations. Such flexible approach can be a good way to address the needs of growing city’s population.; Both options have their advantages and disadvantages, but I think that the solution with high-rise buildings is the best solution. As the world population increases, the need for sustainable and effective urban planning becomes more and more important. High-rise buildings have a number of advantages. One of the advantages is that they save a lot of space, as they can be built higher, so as not to disturb the environment and greenery. Moreover, high-rise buildings can be more energy-efficient and eco-friendly with green roofs, photovoltaic panels and better isolation. Low-rise buildings are often larger and can require more space than high-rise buildings, so that urban sprawl and the destruction of natural areas can occur. Furthermore, they are often less energy-efficient, as they have a larger surface exposed to the environment, which increases the heating and cooling costs. In addition, not only does this reduce the carbon footprint of the building, but it also helps to reduce the urban heat island. Furthermore, high-rise buildings can offer a variety of housing solutions, from cheap apartments to luxury penthouses, which promotes diversity and diversity. However, high-rise buildings should also be considered in terms of their social and economic effects. Despite the fact that urban planning has its advantages, I believe that the high-rise solution is better for a growing population.
1365;IELTS Essay, topic: Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between the rich and poor, while others disagree (discuss);Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between rich and poor people, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.There is no doubt that modern technology is reshaping our planet and affecting every aspect of human lives. From a social perspective, many people argue that the gap between the upper class and lower classes is widening as a result of technological advancements. Others, however, believe the opposite.There are several reasons why one could think that the wealth inequality is, indeed, increasing. The most common reason is automation. Driven by technology, automation reduces the need for manual labour. As a result, less work opportunities are available for unskilled people. With each iteration of the cycle the competition increases and wages decrease. , technology has increased the minimum level of needs that should be satisfied. Nowadays, everybody should have a mobile phone and an internet connection, including the poor. This increases the monetary burden on them as they must borrow to cover these new needs.However, I firmly believe that the aforementioned opinion is ludicrous. The most obvious reason is that modern technology has facilitated the road to riches in an unprecedented manner. For instance, many of the internet billionaires are from lower and middle classes. Moreover, the major leaps in agricultural technologies magnified food production. As a result, food has become more affordable and available. Finally, leveraging technology has dramatically increased workers’ productivity. Consequently, compensations and salaries have increased.In conclusion, I strongly believe that technology could possibly narrow the difference between social classes. Increased food production, opportunities and productivity are just few examples of technology’s contribution to bridging the wealth gap.This essay adequately covers all parts of the task. The ideas expressed in this written response are relevant, well-developed, ordered in a logical way and supported. The paragraphing is suitable and cohesion is maintained throughout the essay. A good range of vocabulary and the writer’s fluency are evident. There are no spelling errors and very few mistakes in word choice and grammar, most sentences are error-free. The essay is likely to get Band 8 in IELTS.; , a question about the role of technology in society. The argument that the gap between rich and poor increases due to the fact that many people can't afford the latest technological developments is completely wrong. But the automation of many industries has a negative impact on the labor market, especially for low-skilled workers, which, in turn, increases unemployment and social inequality. High investment costs in the development of artificial intelligence, in the development of robots, make it so that only large companies and wealthy people can afford to buy this technology, so that the rich have powerful tools to increase their wealth, while the poor have to live with their small amount of capital. Some people think that technology reduces the gap between the rich and the poor. It is argued that the Internet and cell phones have opened up many new possibilities for information, education and employment for people from all social strata. Moreover, these tools have opened up new avenues for entrepreneurship and innovation, which allow people from the lower strata of society to set up their own businesses and compete with large companies. For example, digital money and mobile banking have increased financial access for the poor and enabled them to better manage their finances. In conclusion, it is clear that technology can both increase and decrease the gap between the rich and the poor, but it all depends on how it is used and distributed. So, in my opinion, both governments and companies should take measures to ensure that the benefits of technology are equally distributed between rich and poor people.
1388;In many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?;Nowadays, many children involved in different types of jobs to have some kind of financial assurance for themselves. However, whether this is good for their development and personality is a controversial issue. I personally believe that paid works is harmful for children for several reasons.It is said that children gain valuable experience in the work place. This may be true. However, I would argue that children are mainly employed in jobs that require manual work and are poorly paid. The recent statistics reveal the common tasks that children are assigned to are washing dishes, mopping floors or serving food in restaurants. Meanwhile, this kind of jobs actually provide children with necessary and useful skills to apply in their future .This brings me to the second point. Defenders of child labour that it is an effective method of learning. The point is children should be able to apply knowledge taught to them in a real life working environment. Although this is undoubtedly true, it also means that children may neglect the classroom study and even fail the class. The worst thing is yet to come. They may become so preoccupied with the benefits ahead of them such as small salary that they may leave school.Finally, supporters say that it helps them to build responsibility in the family. They will understand how it is difficult to earn money and therefore have compassion for their parents. This is true to a certain extent, but may have a totally adverse effect on children. As children can make money at an early age, they would feel that it is appropriate to spend it on luxury things.In conclusion, I think that parents should take measures to restrict their child from work, otherwise it would have negative consequences to their future.; In my opinion, the question of whether a child should be allowed to work is not so easy to answer. On the one hand, it is undeniable that many children are forced to work out of poverty, and it is unfair to prevent them from earning their own bread in such cases. On the other hand, I am also of the opinion that children should not be allowed to work if it is dangerous, exploitative or if it interferes with their education. Children are entitled to their childhood and should not be denied this right. On the other hand, it is undeniable that certain kinds of paid work, such as an internship or a trial work, provide children with valuable work experience and teach them important skills that will be useful to them in the future. In conclusion, I believe that it is important to find a balance between allowing children to work and protecting them from exploitation and harm. Above all, it is the responsibility of governments and societies to protect children from exploitation and to ensure that their education and development are given priority. It is the responsibility of us all that children can develop and reach their full potential without being forced to work and be forsaken.
1411;In many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it to be a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion on this?;In the Third World, children are usually sent to factories for laborious work. Many people believe that it is merely exploitation, while others think it is a good opportunity for them to life experience. In any case, children have their right to live and study in peaceful conditions. Therefore, using them as workforce is considered an unacceptable action.First of all, children are not workers. They have just learned about the vast world and do not have any experience or concept of working. Since these innocent children are naive and , they can be easily cheated and exploited. There are many examples of this in poor nations. Because using children is cheap and to control, many enterprises hire them and don’t pay them much. Although the government in these countries has tried its best, this kind of taking advantage of children cannot be eliminated.Moreover, children do not need such thing as ‘valuable work experience’ that is supposedly ‘important for learning and taking responsibility’. The brief responsibility of children is learning. They are not old enough to understand what working experiences are. Nevertheless, they can help parents do chores or housework. This will be a much better way for them to become more responsible for . In addition, childhood is one of the most remarkable memories and must not be taken away by forcing them to work.In conclusion, since all children are the great concern of parent and society, they should be allowed to enjoy life and rather than to work. Hence, one must ponder what view is actually appropriate for the sake of the children.; I think the latter view is correct, but only if the work is appropriate and does not prevent proper education. In addition, many children from poor families are financially dependent on work and not working would only deepen the inequalities in society. Children learn important life lessons from work, such as responsibility, time management and financial management, and a sense of discipline and entrepreneurship, which are of great importance for later work. Nevertheless, the government and authorities should establish and enforce strict regulations to protect children from exploitation and to ensure their well-being. Children must not be employed in unhealthy or exploitative work, and working hours must be limited so that the child does not become tired and this does not prevent his schooling. In short, I think children can benefit from work if this is well regulated and does not compromise their well-being and education. With a good balance between work and study, children learn important life lessons, help their family financially and prepare for responsible and successful adulthood.
361;In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?;"Money can not buy happiness! Is one of the most famous sayings while talking about finances. It is argued that topics around money, wealth, and poverty are becoming dramatically more frequent between humans in different countries around the world. In my opinion, the extream part of it is a negative development; although, it has some positivities. I will address some of both sides in this essay.Talking about money during the major part of the day might make the person look stingy and this is an attitude that majority of the community would not like, thus, might effect on the person's social life. Moreover, having the same topic in mind all day might lead to an obsession, and as a result, this could lead to a depression because the person might not find the proper way to reach to the financial position that meets their satisfaction, which could lead to depression, or even worse such as going through illegal paths where it could destroy their lives entirely!Nevertheless, the person should be aware of his /her income and spendings and try to enhance their financial position to the best possible way. Also, the inflation that we are currently living and the noticable increase in prices could be a driver for people to talk about money more often.In conclusion, people should not be obssessed in money and to talk with everyone about it all the time. However, I believe that people should discuss this matter in order to benefit from each other, and to find more ways to enhance their quality of life."; The general financial difficulties and uncertainty that people have to face daily have increased and increased the frequency with which people talk about money, their earnings and expenses. At one time, a conversation about salaries and expenses was considered impolite and rude. In the meantime, people's openness and trust in their own and each other's lives has made it easier for them to talk about and share their own financial situation. Also, an unhealthy obsession with money and possessions can lead to unhealthy competition and envy between people, or it can lead to an unrealistic expectation and consumerism. This development can have negative consequences. On the one hand, it reflects the growing need to establish contact between people and to share their financial experiences, on the other hand, it can lead to unhealthy preoccupation with money and possessions and lead to the acceptance of consumerism. In conclusion, it is a complex development that has both positive and negative aspects. The best way to do it is to keep a balance between openness and discretion in private conversations so as not to reinforce a culture of materialism and competition.
671;In many countries women and men are working full time. It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;I strongly agree with this statement. If women and men are both working full time, they should share household works.First of all, if women and men are working full time, and they are working in the same amount of time, logically, the amount of time they do household works should be the sam e. However, if one of them work for longer hours, the household works should still be shared but the other one should do more household works.Second of all, everyone have responsibility to do household works because everyone lives in the house, makes the house dirty, creates dirty clothes and dishes. If there is only either women or men doing household works, it is not fair at all, because they both work full time.But as I mentioned before, the amount of time doing household works can be arranged, it doesn't have to be evenly shared. For instance, if the woman in this family work for longer hours or got an extra call by work, the man should help and do her part of household works. And when the man are working more, the woman should do the same. This does not only solve the problem of who should do household works but can also show that women and men are supporting each other in various situations.In conclusion, when women and men are both doing full time jobs, they should share household works. But it doesn't have to to be split in two halves, it can have alternatives depending on the working hours or special situations. In this way, the house can be more peaceful and have more harmony without arguments about who should do the household works.; I completely agree with this statement, and I believe that it not only creates equality, but also recognizes the changing role of families. By sharing this work equally, both partners can have equal opportunities for leisure, self-development and professional development. This division of work also alleviates the burden of women, who have traditionally been the bearers of the burden. But it should be pointed out that the division of work may not be completely fair and equal. Often it is important to recognize the fact that the division of work is not always equally distributed and that it should be recognized. The children in these families also grow up with a healthy sense of gender roles and responsibilities. In conclusion, with the changing role of women and men in society and the working environment, it is fair and logical for women and men to share household chores. Each individual has different abilities, preferences and work schedules that affect their ability to share household chores equally, and therefore it is important to communicate and be flexible to create a balance that suits both partners. However, the division of household chores is ultimately conducive to strengthening families and developing society. This division of work not only reflects the changing role of women and men in society, but also contributes to a more balanced, respectful and equal relationship between the two partners.
1343;In many countries young people start living on their own after high school, is this a positive or negative development?;In many countries around the world young people decide to leave their parents’ home once they finish school. They start living on their own or sharing a house with friends. Is this a positive or a negative development? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples.Sample EssayNowadays it is becoming increasingly common for youngsters to start their independent life by moving out of their parents’ home after graduation from school. This trend has positive effects on the society and the reasons behind it will be discussed next in this essay.There are various benefits for both young people and their parents when individuals start living independently after finishing school. Young adults, in this way, have to take care of their daily needs, from house chores, cooking or cleaning to financial independence. Thus, instead of wasting time on childish activities, they are motivated to learn skills and work part-time or full-time in order to cover their living expenses. Although it might seem challenging for them to live on their own at first, it would give them valuable experience, helping them to become mature, responsible adults. Parents would also be pleased with this practice since they can enjoy their own lives by having more time for themselves. Not only would they have more financial flexibility due to independence of their children, but they also don’t have to change their habits in order to adapt to the new generation’s lifestyle. For instance, it allows many people to travel around the world, which would be impossible if their children were to stay with them after finishing high school.Admittedly, there might be some challenges involved in this way of life. In some cases and especially under the influence of new friends or housemates, youngsters might choose to get involved in dangerous activities that involve drugs or petty crimes. However, instead of keeping their children close through adulthood, parents should prepare in advance and raise their children to distinguish between right and wrong and teach them to take responsibility for their actions.In conclusion, although there might be some adverse consequences to this relatively new practice, I believe that the advantages of young people leaving family home outweigh its drawbacks, for both children and parents.; On the one hand, the transition from school to a new home can be a valuable learning experience for young people. The trend that young people move out of the family home after graduation from high school is a common phenomenon in many countries. This development is a subject of controversy, where some see it as a positive step towards independence and others as a negative development with adverse consequences. Young people who live on their own are forced to take on their own responsibilities, for example, for their own daily schedules, budgets and goals, and this may contribute to developing their self-confidence and their maturity, which are so important for success in the future career and personal life. It teaches them important life skills, such as time management, financial planning and self-reliance. For many young people, it can be a big challenge to plan and manage living costs, education and other expenses on their own. However, there are also negative aspects to this. For many, the transition to life on their own is a difficult one, which can lead to anxiety and worry. While it can be a valuable learning experience for many, and they can learn to take on more responsibility, it can also be very difficult. In addition, when young people are no longer guided and supported by their parents, they may be more vulnerable to negative influences and to taking risks. On the other hand, the most favorable outcome for young people is a balanced approach that combines self-reliance and the support and guidance of family and community.
1320;In many countries, a lot of food is wasted. Why do people waste food? How can we reduce the amount of food waste?;"Despite the fact that millions of people in the world go hungry every day, a surprisingly large amount of food gets wasted daily in certain parts of the world. In my opinion, the main reason for this is that people in the first-world countries tend to only buy food that is aesthetically pleasing, and fortunately, there are some ways to tackle this issue.It is shockingly sad to know that large amounts of perfectly edible food in the form of fresh produce get sent to landfills, and the main reason for this is that these foods do not meet the standards of perfection set for fruits and vegetables by consumers and grocery stores. For example, veggies and fruit that are misshapen or have a few spots on them are still good enough to eat, yet they are often left on shelves to rot in favour of something that looks less damaged. In addition, a lot of customers confuse the ‘best by’ and ‘use by’ dates, thinking that foods that have passed their ‘best by’ dates are no longer fit to eat. Another major reason for food wastage is that people often overestimate the amount of produce they require on a weekly or monthly basis, and most of it ends up getting thrown out instead of being used.There are many ways to reduce the amount of food being wasted, and I think one of the best ideas is to increase people’s awareness of just how much good food is disposed of, only because of our superficial biases as to how food should look. Raising the awareness of the staggering number of people that go hungry in third-world countries would make it harder to throw away an apple just because it is a little bruised. Also, teaching people how to better plan their monthly food requirements would help them not to overspend on food that they do not need; it would be great for the environment and their budget. The role of the government in this endeavour is indispensable as such task would be too great for any smaller organisation.To conclude, the wasting food is a serious issue that merits increased awareness from both people and the leaders of the world. It is unacceptable to discard any food when there are so many people who are starving, and hopefully our joint effort can help improve the current situation."; There are several reasons why people waste food. Food waste has become a significant problem in many countries. It is estimated that each year a large amount of food is wasted, which is not only inefficient, but also harmful to the environment. Moreover, the food that is not yet eaten is often thrown away for aesthetic reasons. The main reason for food waste is over-buying - buying more food than you can eat in a short time, and not enough or faulty storage. What can be done to reduce the amount of wasted food? Firstly, one should plan their own meals and write a shopping list to avoid buying more than they can eat in a short time. Secondly, food should be stored correctly and leftovers should be eaten. Thirdly, governments and companies should take a more active role in reducing food waste. For example, they could establish public awareness campaigns, and introduce various regulations and laws to encourage the redistribution of food that has not been used. Also, one can introduce other ways of reducing food waste, such as converting food waste into fertilizer, which is then used in agriculture. In conclusion, food waste is a significant and urgent problem that requires immediate attention. By taking small steps such as planning meals, storing food properly, and using leftovers, we can make a significant contribution to reducing the amount of food waste in the world. Everyone, individuals, governments and companies, should work together to address this issue and create a more sustainable food system.
1331;In many countries, young people are finding it harder and harder to find permanent jobs. Why is this happening? What can be done to improve the situation?;In this fast-moving age, with the development of education and modern technologies, people strive to have a secure job after graduating from colleges and universities. Despite their efforts, so many young adults in different parts of the world have a negative experience of finding a long-term job.It so happens that most colleges and universities focus on students’ academic performance much more than their practical skills. Unfortunately, many companies reserve permanent job opportunities for experienced applicants because there is no need to invest much in their training. Lack of practical experience in new graduates puts them at a disadvantage as far as companies are concerned. The situation is made worse by the abundance of advanced technologies that can easily replace human labor. Robots and computers work more efficiently and with higher precision than humans. That shrinks the pool of available job placements even more, as companies only need to hire highly educated and experienced staff.Fortunately, there is a number of solutions that can help inexperienced workers gain permanent employment. An obvious one is that universities could offer internships to their students, or arrange workshops in addition to classwork. This would help students to get training and experience in their respective fields. Also, the government could examine the demands of changing labor market and steer young people towards professions that will be popular in the coming years. Together with colleges and universities the government could create special awareness programs for graduates, providing them with an overview of various job offers and their benefits. This way students would be able to choose the right jobs for themselves.To sum up, lack of demand in the labour market and insufficient experience are two major reasons why many young people have trouble finding a permanent position. Helping them gain hands-on experience as part of their studies and educating them about career options early on is key to improving the employment outcome for them.; For the first time, explain that the main reason for this phenomenon is a change in the world economy, which has led to an increase in temporary and contract work. Many companies prefer flexible forms of employment, which allows them to react quickly to changes in the market. Another important factor is the automation of industry and the development of new technology. Machines and artificial intelligence are increasingly replacing human workers, especially in the production and service industries. As a result, young people often have to take on temporary or freelance work, which lacks the stability and security of a permanent position. As a result, fewer permanent jobs are available for young people, especially those who are just starting their careers. Moreover, the high cost of hiring and training new employees can also deter companies from hiring permanent workers. Finally, government and business should work together to give young people the skills they need to succeed in their careers. Companies should provide more permanent positions and invest in their employees to create a stable and secure workplace. The government should encourage companies to offer permanent positions through tax breaks and other subsidies. In addition, vocational training and apprenticeships should be introduced to give young people the practical skills they need for the modern workforce. The government and business should work together to help young people find jobs and build successful and secure careers.
1318;In many workplaces online communication has overtaken face to face meetings. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?;In today’s ever-increasingly digital world, online communication has become the norm for many workplaces. While this development offers numerous advantages for companies such as greater flexibility and efficiency, it also brings with it certain disadvantages like miscommunication, which must be weighed against its benefits.One of the primary advantages of online communication is that it makes it easier for teams to stay in touch without having to physically convene. This is especially beneficial when individuals or groups are dispersed across vast distances. Reduced travel costs, as well as time saved from not having to travel to and from meetings, also represent meaningful savings for businesses. Additionally, online communication platforms often have a range of features designed to make collaboration more efficient, such as providing an easy way to share documents and other materials with remote team members. To illustrate, digital resources can be sent quickly and securely via email or other software services like Dropbox or Google Drive.There is a potential drawback associated with relying too heavily on online communication at work, as the lack of physical proximity between members of a team can often lead to misunderstandings due to a loss of context or nonverbal cues that would otherwise be present during face-to-face meetings. However, in my opinion, issues of this nature can be solved by using written language more carefully to avoid any confusion or miscommunication among colleagues.In conclusion, when online communication tools are used properly, they undoubtedly provide companies with greater flexibility in how their teams collaborate without sacrificing clarity of communication, quality or efficiency.; In my opinion the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages to a certain extent. However, this development has both advantages and disadvantages. Firstly, thanks to the development of the Internet, teams can easily communicate across time zones and distances. This development has opened up new opportunities for international business and remote work. Secondly, the advantages of online communication include: more flexibility, less travelling time and more opportunities for collaboration across the world. On the other hand, too much reliance on online communication can lead to a lack of personal contact, which is important for building trust, resolving conflicts and developing creativity. Finally, it enables fast and easy information exchange, allowing for faster decisions and greater productivity. However, with the growing trend towards remote working and digital collaboration, online communication has become an essential tool for modern working practices. However, it can also lead to distractions, technical problems and miscommunications which all reduce the effectiveness of the collaboration. In conclusion, although there are disadvantages to using the Internet for business communication, it is essential for modern business practices. Moreover, a balance needs to be found between the advantages of remote working and the benefits of face-to-face communication, to optimize the advantages and minimize the disadvantages.
713;In many workplaces, online communication is getting more common than meeting face to face. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?;According to COVID-19 event forced many company to change their way of working. One of the most significant transformation is the communication. The online communication becomes a must or inevitable for the company to be implemented. In this topic, we're going to disscuss the advantages and disadvantages for both ways of communications. The online meeting can introduce a significant impact to the organization while face to face meeting can be outdated for this new era of 2021.First of all for the online communication's advantages is that in the pandemic period the actual physical contact is a significant way to transmit the disease. Video conference can help mitigate this problem by lower the physical contact for each conversation or meeting. Also communicates through online channel can help individual to organize or manage their time efficiently according to each person preference. For example, a single mom parent may be able to spend times for her sons/daughters at home, while be able to have a cross country meeting with another department in other region. Another reason is that some people are quite introvert and find it difficult for face to face human interactions or conversations, in which online chat or messages can help them to mitigate this problem and communicate efficiently. Lastly as mentioned about video conference across region, online meeting can help the multi-national corporates save the transporations cost and additional resources needed to spend for face to face meeting.For the disadvantages, all of the online communications required hardware, internet connection and technological knowledge on how to use them. This technological gap can be seen as one of the most significant obstracle or disadvantage for people to use online communications. For example, in one company, there obviously have a various age of people, in which some of them are not familiar with the technology. Since video call conference has been introduced and utilized widespread among corporates not so long time ago. This can be a big technological gap for some people to use the online communications and result in a lost in communications among the workplaces.As a result, online communication helps an organization to reduce the risk of transmitting the disease, improved the time mangement ability and productivity for each individuals, and lower the financial cost or resources required to spends for international business activities. With all these advantages of online communication stated, they can be seens as a significant reasons to outweight the disadvantages of technological gap on this current year of 2021.; In this essay, I will examine the advantages and disadvantages of a move to online communication at work, and I will argue that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. The move to communication on the Internet at work has become increasingly common. There are many who claim that this development has brought many advantages, and there are others who claim that there have been many disadvantages. In the first place, it increases flexibility and convenience, because employees can communicate with each other and respond to messages at any time or place. This is especially useful for groups that work in different time zones or with employees who work outside the office. It is also important to point out that online communication can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations, because the digital medium often makes it difficult to convey body language and tone of voice. Another advantage is that employees can avoid lengthy meetings and can focus on their work, which also increases productivity. With the development of technology, however, it has become possible to use more advanced tools such as video conferencing and screen sharing, which help to overcome these disadvantages. The disadvantages of online communication are, however, also disadvantages, because employees miss the personal contact and the exchange of views with others. However, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. In conclusion, it can be said that the advantages of increased flexibility and productivity outweigh the disadvantages and that it has become an indispensable tool in modern workplaces. Moreover, companies in the globalized economy that employees often work in different countries and time zones need to use the Internet to stay competitive.
1265;In recent years, the family structure has changed, as well as family roles. What are the changes occurring? Do you think these changes are positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In our modern days, families had witnessed a considerable change regarding their structure and the roles of individuals inside it. These changes are mainly the patriarchal structure that was dominating families in the past compared to a more balanced arrangement nowadays. In addition to that, there are more freedom and rights for women in recent years. And I believe its an advantageous development.Fathers used to be the only leaders of the families of past decades, however in recent days mothers had shared the leadership and started taking part in family decisions just like their partners. Also during recent decades women obtained greater deal of their civil rights which allowed them to take different roles from those that were common for females in the past decades. As an example, women can now own the family house, sign important documents, drive cars which were a breakthrough for women to be able to participate in family plannings and decisions.It appears to be an advantage to have women being able to be effective members of their families, that is because they can share responsibility, add their feminine qualities to the lives of their families as well as for them to be able to fulfill their own life by feeling the importance of their existence and their roles.As in a recent research that found families with women in them are happier, more content, and definitely healthier.In conclusion, the family system nowadays differs vastly from before, owing to the more roles that women are taking, and to the more rights and freedom they gained, and in my perspective it is a positive change.; It is worth noting that there are many single-parent families and many stepfamilies. The role of the male breadwinner is less dominant. In my opinion, these changes are generally positive, as they show that society is becoming more flexible and equal and people are free to make their own choices in their lives. In addition, the growth of gay marriage and the family system has further diversified the concept of a traditional family. Another positive thing about these changes is the reinterpretation of gender roles. For example, single mothers are no longer embarrassed to raise children. Moreover, the balance of responsibilities in the family has become more equal, and this has led to the breakdown of family stability and values. For example, men have taken over the role of child-rearing and domestic work, while women are more willing to enter the workforce and work. It can be said that this change in the family is a natural response to the changing needs and values of society. However, I believe that the advantages of a more flexible and inclusive family outweigh the disadvantages. There are many families with different combinations of family members, and many families need resources and services to meet their needs.
1399;In some countries children have very strict rules of behavior, in other countries they are allowed to do almost anything they like. To what extent should children have to follow rules?;Freedom plays a pivotal role in everybody’s life. We can see in today’s modernized era that nobody likes to be restricted, whether it is a child or an adult. Some people think that there should some strict rules of behavior for children, but I disagree with this statement.that sometimes more restrictions can cause more frustration in children, which leads to many other mental problems as well. they can . Sometimes they feel under pressure, which can be the main reason for their poor performance in their field. In some cases children may insist on doing .In other words we have to look other aspects as well, if we usually ignore our children’s bad habits, then they good human beings in their future life. Moreover if we never draw attention the children’s main activities then they might end up in a bad company. They the value of respect for their elders importance of relationships. They their cultural values as well.In a nutshell, I would like to say that children should be the value of their customs, rituals and respect towards their elders for their future life, but most of the additional restriction should . It would good human beings in their future.; I think children should follow rules to some extent, it is essential for their development and well-being. The question of how far children should have to follow rules is a world-wide debate. In my opinion, children should have rules to follow for several reasons. On the one hand, following rules makes children disciplined and responsible. In the process of following rules, children learn respect for authority, self-control and time management. On the other hand, children should be given too much freedom, which is essential for their mental and emotional development. In the long run, children will become more independent, more creative and more confident. Besides, rules also protect children from danger and make them feel safe. Children must be allowed to follow rules to some extent. On the other hand, total freedom can lead to chaos and anarchy, which can be detrimental to children's development. Clearly, there is a need for parents, teachers and other carers to establish clear boundaries and give children some freedom to choose and learn from their own mistakes. It is important for children to be able to follow rules and still have enough freedom to develop. Children must be allowed to follow rules to some extent.
681;In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development;Nowadays, many businesses have to compete each other in order to survive from the rapidly changing world, leading to the high amount of time that employees spend on working. There are also other reasons why the employees work for a long period which I will discuss in this essay. In terms of consequences, I personally believe that spending most of our time at work is the negative development.It is the fact that people have various rationales to work for long hours. A classic example is the dynamic working condition. There are many companies that provide services such as consultation to customers, meaning that if their service does not completely satisfy the clients’ need, such client may decide to use the service from other competitors. Hence, the employees are required to dedicate their time to deliver the best service to the clients. Another common criticism is a bright career path. When the employees work for a long period, they can carefully check their works and, as a result, delivery the works with less mistakes. Doing this way could impress their manager and they are likely to get promotion in return.With a careful consideration regarding the consequence of working for long hours, there are many vital drawbacks. An obvious effect is the increase in illness. People who work very hard have to spend a lot of their time at work. Therefore, they may not have enough time to do exercises, weakening the immune system of their body. Furthermore, with the rise in the amount of working hours, people tend to lack social skills. This is because they may not be able to manage time to join social events or meet their friends, resulting in the less ability to adapt to new environments.In conclusion, it is undeniable that people work for long hours because of the requirement in business and personal career goal which, in my opinion, leads to negative development for themselves. This is because this behavior negatively affects their health condition and social competency which are the two most important aspects in our life.; Write about it and make an analysis. The answer to this question lies in many factors. Firstly, the competitiveness of the global economy, where companies compete for success, with each other and for the most profitable activity. In some societies, it is a sign of loyalty and loyalty to work long hours, and employees who work overtime are often rewarded with promotions and bonuses. As a result, employees are often forced to work overtime in order to meet deadlines and achieve targets. Another reason is that people want to be dedicated and work hard. However, this development is more negative than positive, as it can lead to physical and mental exhaustion, reduced efficiency and a poor work-life balance. In addition, the development of modern technology has blurred the boundaries between work and private life, making it easier to be connected and available all the time. It can also lead to increased absenteeism, turnover and ultimately affect the company's performance and success. In short, the reasons for working long hours can be justified, but the consequences are worse than the advantages. Thus, it is important that companies and governments recognize the importance of maintaining a good work-life balance and taking measures to prevent employee burnout.
101;In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .;Over decades, there has been a belief that adults should support adolescents to work in a company or travel to another country at least one year before going to university. Despite the fact that there are many positive aspects of having experiences in terms of working and travelling before studying at university, with a careful consideration, there are also negative points of this.It is true that working or travelling before starting a university program positively affects juveniles’ development. A classic example of this is an effective way to truly understand their academic preferences. When juveniles have work experiences, such as having a one-year internship in a company, they tend to learn a wide variety of work functions, helping them know the academic discipline they want to learn at university. Another benefit from taking a long journey to another place before studying at university is the opportunity to get exposed to new culture. This is because while adolescents are on an epic expedition to other parts of the world, they tend to meet new people with different nationality and belief, leading to valuable life experiences that they cannot receive from a professor at university.In spite of the aforementioned advantages of working or travelling before starting university courses, there are also drawbacks. A common example of this is graduating from a college late, compared to juveniles who immediately start a university program after they finish high school. This is exemplified by Thai culture which believes that young people who graduate from university later than their peer would not have a successful career path. In addition, opponents of this notion might argue that working before finishing university is not well worth doing. Since most works require a strong academic foundation in order for juveniles to deliver results with fewer mistakes, the juveniles should study at university instead.In conclusion, it is undeniable that having work experiences or taking a journey before starting a university life has many benefits for young people with respect to knowing the academic fields they want to study and learning new cultures outside a classroom. Nevertheless, doing this could also have drawbacks in terms of the delay in university graduation and an ineffective performance in working.; In this essay I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this period of a gap year. The year between high school and university is becoming more and more popular in some countries. During this year, many young people choose to work or travel to gain life experience and widen their horizons. This year is also a time to acquire work skills, learn and build up a network of peers and internships. Taking a gap year is beneficial in several ways. Firstly, young people have an opportunity to acquire practical experience, which can later be beneficial to their careers. However, there are also some disadvantages to consider. Travelling during the gap year can expose students to different cultures, meet new people and develop independence. Secondly, students can be delayed in their studies, which may affect their careers. Finally, students who take a gap year may find it difficult to enter a study system after a year-long break, and this may affect their academic performance. Students may also find that they are unable to cope with the pressure of work and study. In conclusion, I would like to say that this period of a gap year is a useful experience for young people. During this time, they have the opportunity to learn, to be independent and to travel. A gap year can be a fulfilling and rewarding experience that prepares young people for their future studies and careers. Whether a gap year is necessary depends on the individual's circumstances and priorities.
1304;In some countries, boys and girls are educated separately after the age of about ten years old. Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;In many countries around the world, boys and girls are educated together. There is a group of countries, however, that educate boys and girls separately. This is frequently done on religious grounds, but not always. Having such a system can produce various advantages and disadvantages.One of the principal reasons for educating boys and girls separately is that, if they are together, they can distract each other. After puberty, boys can be strongly attracted to girls and vice versa, and this can result in disruptive conduct in the classroom as, for example, they show off to one another. Separating boys and girls can therefore have the distinct advantage of reducing this disturbing behaviour. However, some teachers have pointed out that this model does not always work, and that separated boys and girls are equally disruptive in class, and sometimes more so. These teachers say that having the opposite sex in the classroom can actually improve behaviour.Many educators also believe that boys and girls have different learning styles and needs. Separating boys and girls can allow teachers to address these needs more easily. There is also a belief that single sex schools allow gender stereotypes to be challenged and therefore education aspirations can be broadened.A major disadvantage of separating boys and girls in education is that the children miss important formative behavioural development when they do not have interaction with the other gender on a regular basis. This can lead to shyness and, more seriously, dysfunctional relationships later in life. Some people also feel that mixed sex schools can promote gender stereotypes rather than reducing them.In conclusion, I feel that children should be educated all together, although I would respect a system in which they are separated due to religious beliefs. My personal opinion is that different genders should learn to interact together from an early age, as this would allow them to develop healthy working relationships with each other.; This view is based on the idea that a single-gender school can improve learning, discipline and reduce distractions. Some people argue that this view makes it possible to give the boys and girls more appropriate teaching. However, I strongly disagree with this view, and I believe that it is more beneficial to teach boys and girls together because it develops social skills and students learn to work together. Besides, it may reinforce gender stereotypes and create gender discrimination. In most western countries, where boys and girls are taught together, they have been observed to be more confident, open-minded and able to deal with both personal and professional challenges. In conclusion, the idea of teaching boys and girls separately may seem to be more attractive, but I am convinced that the idea of co-education is more beneficial. In a single-gender school, the student will miss the opportunity to learn from and appreciate the perspective of the opposite gender, which can lead to a narrow and biased worldview. The schools should therefore be able to provide a balanced and inclusive learning environment where boys and girls can learn together and from each other. This will prepare the students for the future, develop their social skills and help them to break down gender stereotypes.
785;In some countries, only few young people go to classical music concerts or or play classical music. Why? Should young people be encouraged to attend and learn more?;Classical music is one of the oldest artistic samples of our history. However, the young people of the new generations do not appreciate this kind of music. I believe that governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and I will support my stand with valid arguments in the following paragraphs.First of all, the main reason behind the little interest of young people in classical music is the impact of globalization in music and arts. That is because people have the opportunity to know more about multiple things without leaving their homes. However, all this knowledge is only superficial and arts, more specifically classical music, is diminished by the big international industry of music. For instance, reggaeton music, despite the fact that its lyrics are often misogynous, is the most popular style of music these days.Another reason is that children and young people have less interest in cultural matters than in the past because governments do not invest in culture and arts. In most countries, investment in culture has been drastically reduced and young people have no access to classical music concerts and much less a musical instrument that has a huge cost. Consequently, governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and the arts.To summarise, this essay has examined the idea of classical music and why young people do not have an interest in this kind of music. As far as I am concerned governments should take responsibility in this matter and invest more money in culture and classical music encouraging young people to learn more about this kind of art.; There are many reasons for this decline in young people's interest in classical music. The main reason for the decline is the lack of contact with classical music at a young age. The complexity and difficulty of classical music can also be a reason. Another reason is the prevalence of modern technology and the Internet, which has led to a change in entertainment preferences. Unlike pop or rock music, which is all around us, but is not as appealing and interesting to the younger generation as pop music. Further, the musical and social image of classical music, which is usually regarded as elitist or outdated, is also a reason. Young people are more inclined to listen to music that is more energetic, catchy, and easy to share, than to the complex, detailed, and more complicated classical music. Despite these reasons, young people should be encouraged to attend and learn more about classical music. It should be introduced into schools, cultural centers, and even on the Internet, so that young people can access it. It has many benefits for the younger generation, such as improving thinking, creativity, and cultural awareness. In addition, it also gives young people a unique opportunity to develop emotional intelligence and critical thinking. By encouraging young people to participate in and learn more about classical music, it can be ensured that it will continue to be relevant to the young generation, and they will be able to enjoy its beauty and significance. Workshops, concerts, and other interactive activities can also be used to break down barriers and reveal the richness and variety of classical music.
1334;In the modern world, it is possible to shop, work and communicate with people via the Internet and live without any face-to-face contact with others. Is it a positive or negative development?;The feasibility of shopping, working and communicating through the Internet is gradually eliminating the necessity of in-person encounters. I believe the merits of this opportunity outnumber its demerits and the lowered volume of traffic in addition to the possibility of long-range communication will be discussed as reasons for this claim in this essay.One chief benefit of using the Internet as a means of making purchases, working and communicating would be the lowered demand for transport, through eradicating the need for face-to-face contact. Such decreased volume of transportation would result in fewer harmful gas emissions which could significantly contribute to creating a cleaner environment. Furthermore, reduced commuting burden yields more free time for individuals. It could be spent in various ways such as working, studying and socialising with family and friends to name a few, which would be more productive and enjoyable.Another key merit of using the Internet would be the emergence of state-of-the-art telecommunication applications. These technologies have made it possible for those with access to the Internet to get in touch and send and receive audiovisual content by pushing just a few buttons. This presents a stark contrast to the situation only a few decades ago, when long-distance communication was possible solely through paper-based letters, which could possibly take months to reach the recipient.There are, however, some drawbacks to online communication, in particular the possibility that the lack of contact brought by technological advancements could potentially weaken human bonds. Taking into consideration that humans are sociable species, this could pose a dire threat to our mental health. This predicament, however, would be mitigated by the extra free time technological developments create for us. This free time could be spent with friends and family and in the long run would strengthen our relationships and improve our emotional wellbeing.To recapitulate, the Internet’s demolishing the need for person-to-person contact brings about numerous benefits. A more sustainable environment as well as more free time generated for individuals, a reduced need to commute in addition to the feasibility of conducting long-distance communication in the easiest way possible, are all instances of the above-mentioned merits.; Though this development has led to many benefits such as greater comfort and availability, I firmly believe that it is a negative development. The Internet has changed the way people live, work and relate to each other. Humans are by nature social beings and we thrive on social interaction. Prolonged isolation can be very unhealthy for us mentally and emotionally. On the other hand, the Internet has made us less proficient in many of the skills required for social interaction, such as communication, empathy and conflict resolution. When these skills are deprived of face-to-face interaction, it is difficult for us to develop and cultivate them. In addition, the lack of non-verbal communication, such as body language and facial expressions, can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications that can affect both personal and professional relationships. The balance between our digital and physical lives must be maintained for the sake of our emotional, mental and social health. In conclusion, though the Internet has made life much more comfortable, I believe that the lack of face-to-face contact is a negative development. It is important to strike a balance between our digital and physical lives. Only then will we be able to benefit from the Internet while satisfying our innate human need for social interaction.
1344;In the past people wore their traditional clothes, but these days most people wear similar clothes, is this a positive or negative development?;In the past, people wore their traditional clothes and followed their culture. These days, most people wear similar clothes and therefore look very similar to one another. Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?Sample EssayThese days, people’s perspectives on the value of clothing are changing, and individuals tend to wear similar clothing compared to people in the past who opted for their traditional clothing. I believe this tendency exerts a positive influence on the society.It is certainly true that there are some drawbacks to this tendency because it may lead to a loss of global diversity. It can be argued those who wear ordinary clothes such as T-shirts and jeans cannot feel a connection to their roots, and they are likely to neglect their culture and the contribution of their ancestors. Therefore, these people may not take pride in their region, and they might migrate to an urban location rather than contribute to the development of their community. Consequently, many ethnic minorities could suffer from depopulation and eventually disappear.However, I believe that there are more positives than negatives in people opting for similar clothes. The first explanation is that individuals can feel a sense of unity with people all over the world even though they have different religions and ways of life. This would motivate people in the world to support one another, instead of thinking that different parts of the world should deal with their own problems when natural disasters and other terrible problems occur in different nations. Furthermore, this tendency is economically profitable. Generally speaking, as ordinary clothes are automatically manufactured, they can be produced faster and more affordably than traditional clothing such as Japanese Kimono, which is hand-crafted.In conclusion, although people today tend to wear similar clothes instead of traditional ones and this trend cause several problems, I believe that the society as a whole can reap more benefits of this tendency.All parts of the task have been covered.

Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.; Many people in the past were very proud of their own clothes, which often represented their cultural identity. But since the onset of globalization and modernization, a great change has occurred in the way people dress. The transformation from the old clothes to the modern uniform is the world's trend. This uniformity makes it easier for people from different cultures to understand and communicate with each other, and at the same time brings about a sense of equality and unity, so that people of all walks of life are all dressed in the same clothes. From one point of view, this is a positive development. The disappearance of traditional clothes is also a loss to the cultural uniqueness of a country. Because people can no longer be recognized by their clothes, this is a bad development. But from another point of view, this is also a positive development. Because modern clothes are more comfortable and convenient, they are more suitable for daily wear. And the same kind of clothing also promotes the development of fast fashion, which is bad for the environment and society. In summary, although this development is beneficial in terms of unity and practicality, there are also disadvantages such as the disappearance of cultural diversity and the negative impact of fast fashion on the environment and society. People must strike a balance between the old and the new, and can wear their old clothes on special occasions, but also wear the comfortable and practical modern clothes on ordinary days.
641;"Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference. To what extent do you agree or disagree?";There is no doubt these days that the action of the individual is not powerful enough to make the environment better. Unless through laws created by the government and activities have been taken by companies that have a high impact. I strongly disagree with this idea. because there are other ways to help the government as an individual.In essay will prove my point with reasons and examples.Nowadays, people can use social media as a platform that has the power to tell people around the world how to behave. Therefore, an individual has the power to convince others to give higher attention to our environment and create a community that has specific goals to improve. For example, social media influencers could educate the volunteer and work with the youth to make the environment better. For instance, show the young people how to sort the waste and how dangerous the impact is if they do not act in such as way.Moreover, as individuals, people can start doing many actions which benefit the environment by themselves without obstructions. On the other hand, the government and companies should be aware too. For example, while the companies use the factories the government must be monitoring the discharge of fule.In conclusion, after carefully explaining my points of view, in my opinion, it is not necessary to wait for the government and the big companies to act activity for the environment because we as individuals can create and provide educational activities for the public to preserve the environment for the next generation.;" In my opinion, although governments and large companies are certainly capable of producing large effects on the environment due to their large size and resources, it is still possible for individuals to make a considerable difference. For example, individuals can make a difference by adopting more environmentally friendly habits in their daily lives, such as reducing their energy consumption, using public transport, re-cycling and saving water. I do not agree to the extent that governments and large companies can only make a difference; individuals can do a lot to help the environment. Then, through education and example, they can influence others and create a chain reaction. In addition, they can make their purchasing choices, choosing more sustainable and eco-friendly products. For example, choosing products with less packaging or buying local goods can help to reduce carbon emissions and support local economies. In addition, individuals can participate in local conservation activities, such as beach cleanups, tree planting and water saving, which have a significant impact on local nature. Finally, although governments and large companies have an important role to play in protecting the environment, they should not underestimate the power of their own actions. This will create a grass-roots movement, which will force governments and companies to take more sustainable policies and practices. So it is very important to recognize the power of individuals and encourage everyone to take responsibility for their impact on the environment. If everyone made small changes to their daily habits and choices, they could contribute to the overall goal of achieving sustainable development and achieving more environmental protection."
1237;"Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.";"Pollution free environment is important for our life's health and even enjoyement.Everyone whether an individual or large entitiy has an impact on the environment; regardless whether it was good or bad. Hence, I believe it is the responsibility of individulas as well as governments and large companies.Individuals can do a lot to improve the environemt around them starting with taking some actions to make a difference. For example, every memeber in the sociaty can support recycling efforts by sorting their garbages into different categoreis, instead of wasting the efforts of recycling companies to do so. Another exmaple would be to stop using plastic products and replace them with more environemt friendly products like pepar products.Moreover, teaching and spreading awarness about the importance of keeping our environemt clean are another way to make a difference. For instance, we can use social media to spread awarness and start campaigns about enviorment and pollution. Furthermore, we can teach some classes in schools and universities about this subject. As a result, this will help the upcoming generations to understand the problem and have them continue the efforts of improvement.While individuals efforts are essential, they must be supported by governments and large companies in order to complete the circle. A main example here would be establishing regulations and laws that would minimze the damage to the environment and maintain pollution at low levels, which is the role of the governments around the world. As for large companies, they can support by adopting the best practicies and take the proper actions to reduce pollution and improve the environment. As an example, they can start using clean and renewable energies to power their facilities and plants. In addition, those companies can develop technologies that contributes toward keeping the environment safe, and prompet the use of clean energy and vehicales.To sum up, the responsibility to improve the environemt must be divided between all three parties individuals, governments, and large companies. Each has his role to enhnace the environemnt and reduce the pollution. They complete each other and they should work together toward a better future for our world."; Individuals can help the environment in many ways. I disagree strongly with the statement that individuals can do nothing to improve the environment, governments and big companies can do a difference. The individual can, for example, reduce energy consumption, use public transport and buy sustainable products. Local campaigns and conservation efforts can also have a significant impact on the local environment. These campaigns can reduce the consumption of single-use plastics, encourage people to reuse what they can and encourage people to think about the environment. One recent example of a campaign that has had a significant impact on the environment is the reduction-reuse-recycle movement, which began as a small movement and has now become a worldwide phenomenon. By making a conscious choice and doing small things, people can help to create a sustainable future. So, I strongly disagree with the statement, and I think the collective effort of individual people can have a positive impact on the environment. In conclusion, governments and large companies do have an important role in protecting the environment, but I also think that individual people can do a lot.
1301;It is a fact that the majority of people who are sent to prison commit further crime after their release.What is causing this? What can be done to change this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is a sad fact that criminals who leave prison go on to commit further crime. There are various reasons for this, but there are also some things that can be done to prevent it from happening.One reason for this recidivism is due to a lack of legitimate income. Many people turn to crime as they cannot find an alternative to earn money. When such person comes out of prison, it is very often the case that they have the same few opportunities for a legitimate income. In fact, these opportunities will even be reduced, as employers are often less willing to give an ex-prisoner a job. Some people also return to crime, as they spend all the time of their prison sentence with other criminals. This is not a great environment for rehabilitation, and sometimes even a network of contacts can be made to help develop criminal activities on release.One important way to help address this problem is education. Criminals who have turned to illegal activities because of no alternatives to earn a living need to learn a way to earn a wage, such as a trade or vocational skills. Computer skills, for example, are in high demand and someone trained in these could very possibly find work. In addition, governments can offer incentives to employers to attract them to give jobs to newly-released prisoners. This would help people who don’t really want to return to crime achieve a fresh start. As keeping people in prison is an expensive business, governments might find it cheaper to pay these incentives.To sum up, people returning to crime is a tragedy that should be avoided if at all possible in today’s society. Education and incentives can directly address the reasons for it and could make society a happier and safer place.; Write your answers in English. The problem of high recidivism in the criminal justice system is very urgent, and it is caused by many factors such as the lack of rehabilitation, the lack of social support, and lack of employment. For example, according to the research, prisoners who took part in vocational training and received guidance were much less likely to commit crimes than those who did not. Another reason for high recidivism is the failure of prisons to offer effective rehabilitation. Many prisons are more aimed at punishment than rehabilitation, and therefore the former prisoners have no tools and support to be reintegrated into society. Also, former prisoners are faced with stigma and discrimination, which prevents them from getting a job and restoring family and social relationships. It is therefore very important to give prisoners access to education, job training and mental health care in order to equip them with the skills to live a law-abiding life. To break the recidivism cycle, governments and correctional institutions must invest in evidence-based programmes such as cognitive behavioural therapy and vocational training and help ex-convicts find employment and access social services. In addition, the community should provide former prisoners with a network of support and help them to be reintegrated into society. In this way, we can reduce recidivism and create a safer and more supportive community.
1336;It is believed that people who read for pleasure develop their imagination more and acquire better language skills compared to people who prefer watching television. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Some people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. Personally, I support this opinion for several reasons, which will be laid out in this essay.As we all know, books use text to convey ideas and quite often there are no images or illustrations to picture the scenes described in the book; therefore, we have to use our own imagination while reading. For example, reading a fantasy novel that contains mythical creatures one would normally see the appearance of those characters in their mind while following the plot. In contrast, movie heroes on a TV screen are usually created for the viewer by directors and producers of the film. Watching TV substitutes the need to develop one’s own imagination because the characters and their surroundings are shown on the screen.Furthermore, it is argued that reading is the best way to expand one’s vocabulary. The reader learns the correct spelling of a word by seeing it printed in a book, and they grasp its meaning from the context, without having to look it up in a dictionary. Not only new words but also numerous sentence structures can be learnt from books. To take advantage of these benefits English teachers in many schools use English novels as teaching materials. Students are asked to read the story and capture the keywords to answer the questions in the exam. In comparison, learning new words while watching a TV show isn’t always easy because the viewer’s attention is drawn to the action on the screen and if there are no subtitles, the spelling of the words is not obvious. All this makes a book a more effective tool for a language learner compared to TV.In conclusion, I believe people who love to read tend to have a more active imagination and advanced linguistic comprehension than those who watch television, since readers are required to imagine the story in the book and learn the meaning of new words from the context."; I agree to a large extent. Reading for pleasure has been shown to have a major impact on development, especially in the area of imagination and language. In addition, when reading, the mind is developed by thinking about what the characters, places and events are like. This thought process develops imagination, which is a precondition for creativity and innovation. While watching a film, the viewer is offered a visual narrative that has already been prepared for him. Moreover, if there is some contact with language through film, this is often confined to spoken language and does not offer the same depth and complexity as written texts. By reading, you can learn more about different writing styles, genres and dialects, and you can therefore enrich your language repertoire. But it must be said that some types of television, such as documentaries and other educational programs, can be a good source of knowledge and encourage the imagination. However, I still consider that reading for pleasure is the most effective way to develop imagination and language skills. Reading is a valuable activity for both personal and intellectual development.
753;It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;"Nowadays a lot of primary schools are starting to introduce the teaching of animal care and general agriculture. Many people think that primary children should study and understand how to grow vegetables and keep animals; this essay will discuss why primary school should learn about this two arguments and how the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.It is very important study and understand how to grow vegetables and how to keep animals, especially in a younger age. Most of the kids, that frequent the primary school, have this desire of having a pet and, the opportunity of studying how to take care of it in the school, can make the child more aware of the responsibilities that he will have if, one day, he has to own one of them. At the same time, for a primary children it's also important to understand how vegetables grown and what's the process behind that , learning about this arguments will help the kids to appreciate more the food and, as a consequence, in the future there will be less waste of it .It's clear that the advantages will be more than the disadvantages, if there are any. If every kid will know more about the arguments, the world in the future will become a better place, with more respect for the animals and more appreciation for the vegetables that, will also help people to make a healthier life.In conclusion, this essay discussed on how the introduction of subjects like animal care and general understanding of how vegetables grow, will help the kids to become better adults in the future to make of this world a better place."; On the one hand, the benefits of growing vegetables and raising animals are many. In my opinion, the advantages of teaching children these skills far outweigh the disadvantages. Children learn from growing vegetables where their food comes from and what it takes to keep themselves healthy. The care of animals develops the ability to care and care for animals and plants. In addition, these activities can support and enrich academic subjects. For example, the growth of plants and the feed needed for animals are an opportunity for math lessons. On the other hand, it is possible that introducing these activities into a primary school curriculum would be time consuming, expensive and distracting from core subjects. A further difficulty would be that these skills are usually learned outside the classroom, which could lead to learning difficulties. In conclusion, teaching primary children to grow vegetables and raise animals offers many benefits, from developing life skills to encouraging conservation and improving academic learning. Children who are taught these skills in school will be responsible, kind and aware of the environment.
1296;It is the responsibility of individuals to save and provide for their own retirement. Governments have no obligation to provide this benefit.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The responsibility for providing funds for retirement is incredibly important and something that is often overlooked by younger people. Some believe it is the responsibility of the individual to plan for this, but others feel it is the responsibility of the state.People who believe that the state should be responsible for funding retirees, base their argument on the fact that in most countries, people pay taxes and social charges to the government. This money, they argue, should also go towards the provision of a pension for the person paying the tax. In addition, those who have very small or no income, pay little or no tax and do not have the ability to provide for themselves. The government, therefore, in its role of caring for the population, has an obligation to pay a pension and provide other social benefits, such as medical treatment.Many others, however, feel that it is the responsibility of individuals to fund their own retirements. As adults, they argue, people should be able to set aside and invest money throughout their lifetime, so that they can retire with few financial worries. In many countries the government has legislated a framework allowing and encouraging citizens to save up and accumulate sufficient funds for the period after their working years have ended.I neither agree nor disagree with the statement, but rather my opinion takes in parts of both arguments. I feel that people should be responsible for saving money to fund their retirement, but I also feel that individuals who have not had the chance to do so should be supported by the government out of taxes. In my view, therefore, it is wrong to say that governments have no obligation to help people in this area. Governments are there to support the entire population of their countries, which includes the poorer elements of society.; I partly disagree with the statement that it is the responsibility of individuals to save and provide for their own retirement and that governments have no obligation to provide this benefit. The ability of individuals to make their own decisions about the financial future and thus be able to plan their retirement according to their personal circumstances and goals is the first reason for me to agree with this statement. On the other hand, I think that governments should contribute to retirement provision for valid reasons. There are cases where individuals do not have enough to save for their retirement due to unforeseen circumstances such as unemployment, illness or a low salary. In such cases, government support can ensure that pensioners maintain a minimum living standard. Individuals may also lack the financial skills or access to suitable retirement savings vehicles to allow them to plan their retirement effectively. For example, countries with well-developed retirement provision, such as Denmark and Sweden, demonstrate that government-funded retirement provision significantly reduces poverty among the elderly and contributes to social stability. In general, I believe that while individuals should take responsibility for saving for their retirement, governments should also contribute to ensuring that their citizens have a safe and dignified retirement. Therefore, a combined approach between individuals and governments will lead to the best possible retirement provision for citizens.
1287;It must be a woman who stays at home to care for children. Men are not suited to this kind of work. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Traditionally in many parts of the world, it has been women who have stayed at home to care for children. This has led to the ideology and expectation that women are more suited to this type of work than men.The overwhelming status quo where women stay at home to care for the children probably derives from the fact that women are the ones who have to actually give birth to children and, following that, they are the ones who for the early part of a child’s life have to feed the child until it is weaned. In times past, this state of affairs probably led to the women assuming the permanent role of carer for the home and children, whilst men went out to work, whether it was to gather food or work in fields or factories.In spite of the fact that this became what was expected in family dynamics, it does not mean that men are necessarily less suited to caring for a child than women. It is very possible for men to care for a child, even from birth onwards in today’s world. Babies’ milk formula can be mixed by anyone and fed to a child. The fact that many women today choose not to do this again does not mean that they are better suited by nature to care for the child.Suitability for childcare is a matter for individual temperament and aptitude. Not many people, whether they are men or women, feel totally confident and knowledgeable about how to care for a baby or young child at the start. They need advice from their own mothers and fathers, midwives or from books. It is only from experience that skill with childcare comes and this skill can be acquired regardless of gender.All in all, I do not agree with the statement that men are less suited to childcare than women. I believe that aptitude to look after children is a matter of individual temperament, not gender-specific inherited qualities.; The question if it is a woman who stays at home to take care of the children and that men are not suited to this kind of work is a completely outdated view and it represents a harmful gender stereotype. The statement that it must be a woman who stays at home to take care of the children and that men are not suited to this kind of work is false. There are more and more men who have a greater role in child care and show that they can be very good caretakers. Men are just as good at raising and caring for their children as women are. In addition, research has shown that fathers' involvement in the child's development has a positive effect on its development. Children who have active and engaged fathers have better school results, higher self-esteem and fewer social problems than children who have less involved fathers. This type of role is not only beneficial for the children, who get the affection and care of both parents, but also for the men, who become more close to their children. In addition, many countries, such as Sweden and Denmark, have established a policy to encourage men to take parental leave, which has led to a significant increase in the number of men staying at home with their children. This not only contributes to a more equal sharing of family chores, but also that it can be a man who stays at home. This demonstrates that it is important that men are involved in child care and that they are not suited to this kind of work. As society continues to develop, it is important that we do not only deny and deny the outdated gender stereotypes, but also that we support greater equality and more flexible division of child care tasks. In conclusion, the statement that it must be a woman who stays at home to take care of the children and that men are not suited to this kind of work is no longer correct.
1105;It's generally believed that success in fields such as art and sport can only be achieved if a person has natural talent. However, it's sometimes claimed that any child can be taught to become a good sports person or artist.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"It is common to think that in fields like art or sport success is linked to natural talent, even though it is stated that children can obtain good results also trough learning and pratice.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------In my opinion, I believe that only a combination of natural talent and sacrifice can lead you to obtain success; for this reason, you can learn and improve several skills, but you will not win against a person with this type of gift, unless this person does not pratice enough.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------To provide an example, if we think about Raffaello, one of the most remarkable painters of all times, and his life we may be disappointed; in fact, thanks to his natural talent he started to paint since he was 8.However, we have to bear in mind that he constantly made a research in order to discover new techniques and to gain new inspirations.If he was not so focused on his art's improvement, he would not be able to paint an entire church.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------If we move to another field as sport is always more evident the existence of a pattern. Indeed, it is crystal clear that professional players need to pratice everyday, regardless their talent.However, Ronaldo this year has winned the nominee for the best football player in the world not only for his innate talent but also for the effort put during training in order to reach always an higher goal.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------In conclusion, through commitment you will obtain good results, but to achieve the highest level you must be gifted with a natural talent."; It's generally believed that in order to be successful in the field of art or sport a person must have natural talent. On the other hand, there are people who argue that anyone can be taught to be good at these things. One way of looking at it is that the person who is naturally good at it is given a head start, but with good training, perseverance and the right guidance they can achieve success. A child who is naturally built for sport or who has an eye for colour and composition has a head start in becoming a good sportsman or artist. Nevertheless, a person who has no natural talent can learn and become good at these things. One good example of this is the artist Stephen Wiltshire who, despite being diagnosed as having Asperger’s syndrome, taught himself to draw and paint. So I believe that a combination of both nature and nurture are required to achieve success and that if a child has the right attitude and the opportunity they can become a good artist or sportsman. Moreover, talent is a subjective concept which can be influenced by many factors such as opportunity, encouragement and personal drive.
1420;Learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Evaluation of the importance of timing is essential, past to show the importance of their present, while that to even remember their past because it would not help them at all. It is a very controversial and complicated matter., many people believe this statement, for many reasons. Firstly, all of us had made many mistakes which we would not like to remember, they will affect their present because they can create some problems with our families example. Secondly, instead of remembering those past trials, one should get the benefits of their present.Regardless of what I said previously, many people are sticking to their past to give themselves a push in their present. It can give a way of learning from mistakes, and a good chance to try to avoid anything that once lead to a past failure.Moreover, success will not come without failure, everybody should make an attempt, even if it fails, and it may become a big success if they try it again and again. In addition, our past is our culture and heritage which we should not forget at all, it is a matter of value to our present and future, and will remain such till the day will die.To sum up, in my opinion, we can not live without a past, it is our value of life. it can help create your experiences and solve your problems better in the future.; Learn from the past. The result of the World War II should be taught in schools. Is it not useful for us to learn? And we should not ignore the experiences of the civil rights movement in the United States. Then we will be able to see what progress has been made and how much more needs to be done. Then we can recognize our mistakes and find out what could have been done better. History gives us a sense of belonging. It makes us realize what our cultural roots are and how they have been developed. So we can work towards a better world, a more fair world. Those who live in the present should be interested in the past. It gives us important lessons, a sense of belonging and a deeper understanding of the complexities of the human experience. This also gives us a sense of community and shared values that are so important to building a strong and cohesive society. Knowing the past makes us understand the present and future more clearly and enables us to make more informed decisions that will benefit us and our children.
1197;Learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Learning about the past may provide advantages and disadvantages, depending on the position we are situate ourselves in life ;Undoubtedly, it has great advantages for the ones who need to progress in life, despite what they had been through, because to my opinion, greatest lessons in life come with our own experiences. Advantages of learning about the past are also on the side of the ones who personally know themselves very well and stay honest to themselves at all times.For example, someone who try to be someone, acting to please influent people or trying to get somewhere he or she would not be able to if he were playing real, could be embarrassed by their own mistakes or feeling humiliated when looking back to what he accomplished to get where he/she is now ; therefore the past in this situation would not be a great option for him to look back after.Despite this kind of personality, there are lots of people who find out constructive knowledge in looking back to the past, regardless of how great or bad it could be.The kind of people who actually face their own past and do not try to hide it are the ones who are not scared of how people will judge them, but are willing to make greate changes in their future.It is ,to me, the definition of true progress; how could we learn from our own experiences if we are not willing to face ourselves ?Past can be hurtful but I do think that everything we have been through is a constructive lesson for today and tomorrow."; Writing an essay like this can be a difficult task, but I strongly disagree that history has no value for those of us living in the present. Understanding the past is necessary to a more complex understanding of the present and the future. By looking at the past, we can see recurring patterns that still have an effect on us today and can help us make better decisions about how to resolve these problems. For example, the World War II period gives us a better understanding of the importance of diplomacy and the devastating consequences of nationalism and bigotry. Similarly, the civil rights movement in the United States can give us a more complex understanding of social issues today, such as discrimination and equality. And by looking at different cultures and different times, we can expand our perspective and challenge our own ideas about what it means to be human. Finally, learning about the past also increases our sensitivity to the past, which is good for our cultural understanding and our empathy for people and the world. The main thing I want to say is that learning about the past has tremendous value for those of us living in the present.
1375;Many believe that international tourism is bad for their country (reasons and solutions);Many people believe that international tourism is a bad thing for their countries. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to change this negative attitude towards international tourism?Many individuals think that foreign tourism brings negative effects to their countries. There are several reasons for such negative attitude towards international travelers. However, a couple of solutions could be adopted to handle this situation, as will now be discussed.International tourists are often criticized for their contribution to the environmental degradation. It has continuously been noticed that they throw rubbish in their surroundings irresponsibly, which increases the amount of litter everywhere, despite all attempts to reduce waste produced by the local community. This contributes to water, air and soil contamination.Furthermore, foreign tourism has a harmful influence on traditional customs and indigenous practices of host countries because many tourists are careless and insensitive the emotions and feelings of local residents. For instance, in India, some foreign travelers wear inappropriate clothes or expose too much of skin when they visit sacred places, which leads to some negative attitude and the local public.However, this situation can be improved different solutions which could be handled by the government. The government should explain the benefits of international tourism which contributes to the development of local . They not only spend money in shops and restaurants but also create jobs in service industries, and this aspect could be publicized. Additionally, the government should increase the awareness among the foreigners through different media such as roadside billboards and advertisements, and tourists should be encouraged to get rid of rubbish correctly.In conclusion, the inhospitable feeling that the local people have for international tourists can be explained in many ways. However, in my opinion, the government’s involvement is essential to change the negative attitude by citing various advantages of international tourism to their country and raising awareness among tourists in order to protect local habitats.This essay covers the entire task topic by exploring both reasons for negative attitude towards international tourism and some possible actions to change it. The writer explains why locals may resent international tourists and suggests what steps can be taken to transform the way people feel about foreigners in their country. The information is well-organised by the use of paragraphing, and the writer moves from one idea to the next effortlessly, with the help of linking words. A wide range of vocabulary is used, including less common words such as “degradation”,”inhospitable”, “habitat”, “awareness” and “sacred”. Instances of inaccurate word choice are rare, and even these slips don’t cause difficulty for the reader. Overall, this looks like a Band 8 essay.; Some believe that the influx of foreign tourists harms the local environment, culture and economy. Many believe that a lot of foreign tourists harm the local environment, culture and economy. As a result of this, the local culture and local tradition can disappear in the midst of foreign influence. The commercialization of local monuments and historical places distorts their significance and originality. The high demand for these resources leads to their depletion and depletion, especially in the underdeveloped areas. The tourist industry, especially in countries with underdeveloped economies, often displaces and impoverishes local populations. In addition, it is a common practice for foreign tourists to take precedence over local people, so that the local population is pushed out and impoverished. To combat this, governments and tourist agencies can develop and promote the concept of sustainable development. On the other hand, if we are not afraid to take responsibility for the whole life cycle of a tourist object, we will be able to reduce the negative effects of tourism and ensure that its benefits are shared more evenly. Moreover, it is necessary to regulate the number of tourists and spread them throughout the year, so that the environment and resources are not overwhelmed. We must also consider the interests of the local population in this respect.
1297;Many cities have areas where the only cars are taxis and buses.Is this a positive or a negative development? What are the effects of this on individuals and society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Banning cars from the centre of various cities around the world has been a strategy to reduce pollution and encourage people to use public transport. It has had various positive effects for both individuals and for society as a whole.Banning cars from the centre of cities seems to be a very positive development. Fewer cars on the road means less pollution and fewer fossil fuel resources being used up. Although the effect on resources might be relatively negligible, it can create a newer way of thinking regarding the dynamics of transport within cities and this could be the most important benefit to society. Some people working in the centre of these cities may complain about inconvenience, but many would agree that this is a small price to pay.A reduction in the reliance of people on private vehicles is likely to encourage them to use public transport or even bicycles. Using public transport, especially the types that run on clean sources of power, will significantly raise air quality levels in cities, which will of course benefit everyone. The clean air could even further encourage the use of bicycles, which would in turn promote more healthy lifestyles and less obesity. This would contribute on an individual level to people’s well-being and a better and longer life, and on a societal level, it would lessen the strain on public health resources. Governments could encourage this by creating more bicycle lanes to make cycling easier and safer.In conclusion, it is clear that banning cars from the centre of cities is significantly beneficial. Better health and ecology, as well as improvement in longevity and well-being can benefit individuals and the entire society.; It is a positive development to prohibit cars in some parts of the city and allow only taxis and buses. Reducing private traffic reduces congestion on the road and makes it safer and more convenient for both public transport and taxis. In addition, public transport and taxis are more efficient, which makes it easier and more predictable for people to get around, which can lead to increased productivity and a better life. This development brings many benefits for both individuals and society as a whole. In society, the development contributes to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which is crucial for global climate action. The development also promotes a shift towards more sustainable mobility, such as walking and cycling, by making the city more friendly to pedestrians. There are cities such as Copenhagen, where such policies have been successfully introduced, with the result that the city is cleaner, safer and more liveable. Besides promoting sustainable transport, the development strengthens the sense of community and cohesion in the city and reduces the costs for health care. This shift can also lead to a healthier and more active population, which relieves the health service. In conclusion, the prohibition of cars in certain city districts and the possibility of using only taxis and buses are future-oriented solutions that offer a host of advantages for the city's development, from increased health and better quality of life to greater social cohesion. A proper plan and provision of accessible and viable alternatives to transport is essential for the development to be successful for everyone. With a well-thought-out implementation, the development can significantly contribute to more sustainable, equitable and sustainable cities.
1332;Many countries are experiencing population growth and need to build more homes. Some say that new homes should be constructed in existing cities while others argue that new towns should be built to accommodate the growing population. What are the advantages and disadvantages of these points of view?;In the past two decades, there has been an exponential increase in the migration of people to different cities and countries, indirectly resulting in a considerable infrastructure development. However, there has been a long-standing debate on whether to direct these infrastructure projects to current cities or establish new counties. Careful consideration of both alternatives reveals that each has its positives and negatives.One of the major advantages of focusing on current cities for new construction is that it would benefit the residents of the cities in multiple ways. Tenants living in Vancouver would prefer to buy a newly constructed house in the city where they work rather than in a new town, to reduce their commute time. Moreover, the city has everything they desire such as efficient public transport, thriving job market and affordable healthcare. This would not be possible in new towns because of the time it takes to establish services and generate opportunities for people.On the other hand, accommodating people in houses built in newly created towns would put them in a pollution-free and clean environment. This is because new towns may take at least 10 years of time to become an attractive spot for people and industries alike. As a result, their exposure to harmful emissions from industrial plants and transportation is reduced, shielding them from the risks of acquiring health complications. A recent report released by the word Health Organization (WHO) suggests that the number of people affected by airborne infections is 20% higher in cities compared to new towns that were formed just a couple of years ago.In conclusion, while there are both positive and negative aspects to these views, the decision on where to build the new homes to accommodate increasing population will depend on many other factors as well. Therefore, a thorough assessment is required before starting an infrastructure project.; Each point of view has advantages and disadvantages. To build new homes in existing cities has several advantages. For example, they can use existing schools, hospitals, transport and other facilities. In addition, they have easy access to existing shops, restaurants and entertainment. However, to build new towns offers a clean slate for urban planning and design. New towns can be built with green technology and sustainable infrastructure, which can give residents a high quality of life. On the other hand, this approach can lead to increased congestion, strain on existing resources and a higher cost of living. This solution has many disadvantages. For example, building new towns requires large investment in facilities and roads, and it takes time to build and grow. In addition, new towns must be designed to meet the needs of a growing population, which requires large housing and employment opportunities. By recognizing the advantages and disadvantages of each solution, policymakers can make informed decisions to build sustainable and livable communities for their growing populations. To sum up, it seems that to build new homes in existing cities and to build new towns can accommodate a growing population and reduce the disadvantages of each solution.
1327;Many people argue that museums and art galleries should present the nation’s art, as opposed to artworks from other countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The cultural value of engaging with museums and art galleries is unquestionable; they exert a great deal of influence on our perception of the world. It is only reasonable to ponder whether or not these outlets of culture should concentrate their efforts on presenting the nation’s own art, and not that of other countries. In my opinion, there should be an attempt to strike a balance and put the objects of national art in the spotlight, while allowing the public to get acquainted with foreign artworks to a certain extent.If people were to only find sculptures and paintings by national artists in their local museums, that would have a number of positive effects, such as the fame the artists of that country would gain and the pride its citizens would feel for their fellow countrymen. It would promote patriotism and strengthen the image of the country in the eyes of its inhabitants. Local artists would also receive more financial assistance from the government as their works would generate a significant amount of interest, potentially resulting in further development of the local art. However, in order to evolve art needs fresh ideas, and without exposure to a wider range of creativity the world provides, the evolution of local arts may be hindered.People enjoy art because it appeals to their inner sense of beauty and triggers strong emotions, and whether the masterpiece that causes these feelings belongs to a local or foreign artist is irrelevant. Talent knows no geographical boundaries; therefore, the emphasis should be on how much joy or amazement the work of art brings, rather than on its origin. If that principle were to be followed, we would never have to choose between local and international art. Reducing our museums or galleries’ collections to local art works, in my view, would be harmful and go against the democratic nature of art.To sum up, it seems to me that a country has nothing to lose by allowing its people to admire art created elsewhere in the world. A conscious choice by the government to support local artists while hosting exhibitions from other countries could prove the most beneficial."; On the one hand, presenting national art can strengthen the nation’s national pride and identity. While I understand the reasoning behind this argument, I partially disagree. An art museum, for example, which shows only national artists can promote and protect the cultural heritage of the nation. Besides, a museum showing only national artists can help emerging local artists gain public recognition and international exposure. However, I also believe that museums and art galleries should show international art, to give visitors the opportunity to learn about other cultures, historical periods and artistic movements. This approach could help to develop an appreciation of other countries’ art. Besides, it can promote intercultural understanding, intercultural awareness and intercultural exchange. In conclusion, while I understand the importance of presenting national art, I also believe that museums and art galleries should show both national and international art. They should encourage the nation’s pride and identity, while also promoting the cultural diversity and intercultural understanding. This can help to enrich the lives of visitors, making the nation a more tolerant and empathetic society.
955;Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?;Numerous experts think that every country should be capable to produce more materials and commodities. I agree with this argument as it brings benefits to countries and I will highlight some of them.To begin with, manufacturing goods is essential to any country as it helps to build their economy. Increasing production power assist them to export more and it also makes them less dependent on other countries. For instance, China is one of the largest producers in the world in any goods which also makes them the largest exporter. Such development in production power contributes to their gross domestic product.Another reason is that extra produced goods can be used in emergencies, such emergencies are pandemics, financial crises and many more. By growing the production of goods and materials, a country will always be a reliable business partner. Thus, companies will reach out to them and become loyal partners. Moreover, countries should be aware that by increasing their production. For example, there is a semiconductor chip crisis is going on all over the world and no country in the world is able to meet the demands of chips. On the contrary, India is now planning to satisfy the demand for chips by strengthening its manufacturing capacity to a massive level while it will directly contribute to their economy and also generate job opportunities.To conclude, I agree that more in-house production is necessary. It is extremely crucial to produce more needed products in order to consistently outperform the rest of the world and also it brings many beneficial things like generating job opportunities and a rise in the Gross domestic product of a country.; However, I partly disagree with this assumption. It is true that the production of more goods leads to the development of the economy, the growth of employment and the improvement of living conditions. But there are many disadvantages of such a development. Japan and South Korea have achieved rapid economic growth through industrialization and increased production. Nevertheless, increasing production has a lot of benefits. It encourages innovation, reduces the price of goods and increases access to goods. To produce more goods, on the other hand, leads to exploitation of workers and the formation of a gap in the distribution of income. Moreover, if we value production more than anything else, the environment will be damaged and natural resources will be exhausted. Governments and policymakers should strive for sustainable development, taking into account both economic and social factors, rather than just relying on production. In conclusion, although increasing production can lead to economic growth and development, it should not be the main goal of the country. This is because governments and policymakers need to pursue a more balanced and sustainable development. This is what the future of a country depends on.
1367;Many people believe that reducing speed limits is the best option for road safety improvement (agree/disagree);"Many people believe that reducing speed limits is the best option for road safety improvement. Do you think there are other measures that could be put in place? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?One of the most conspicuous trends of today’s world is a colossal surge in the number of vehicle accidents cars, trucks and buses, all over the , be it in impoverished or developed nations. There is a wide range of factors that . In my opinion, this situation could be remedied, provided some effective measures are taken.Measures to deal with this soaring concern are many; the most significant are not remote or complicated but accessible and practicable. The primary one lies in the fact that governments should take a firm stance and apply stringent rules and regulations to lower the speed limit. Secondly, using electronic devices while driving should be forbidden by law. Finally, an awareness program could be initiated by individuals to educate the public about the catastrophic effects of unsafe roads and the projected enhancements for road safety. Only when convergent efforts from all sectors are ensured, can we expect to see considerable progress in tackling this problem.There is a deluge of merits for implementation of reduced speed limits. High speed is likely to impose life threatening danger on people crossing the roads, due to the perilous nature of this hazardous speed with danger being an integral part of it. Not only does reducing the speed limits contribute to decreasing daily accidents, but it also raises the standard of driving. Needless to say, all these advantages have a far-reaching impact on pedestrian safety.There are, however, some pitfalls that can easily overpower the potential benefits of limiting speed. The primary one stems from the fact that slowing the speed could lead to augmenting the daily traffic hours. Besides, it could also delay delivering sick and patients to hospitals. Hence, it is apparent why some individuals are against changing the standardized level of speed.From what has been discussed, one can conclude that despite the drawbacks of reducing speed limits, the expected benefits of this measure are indeed far greater.All the parts of the task have been covered fairly well. The response presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt with suitable, widely covered and thoroughly supported ideas. The range of vocabulary is adequate for the requirements of task response. There are some mistakes in word choice and grammar. Nevertheless, the essay is up to the mark and is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS."; It is obvious that many road accidents are caused by speeding, which leads to a loss of control and longer stopping distances. Therefore, reducing the speed limit is the best option to increase road safety. Besides, a reduction in speed limits also leads to a decrease in the severity of accidents. The collision is usually less strong at lower speeds, which leads to fewer fatalities and fewer severe injuries. This is especially true in residential and school areas, where there is a greater risk of accidents and injuries to people. It is also worth noting that the speed limits can have other benefits, such as the reduction of traffic jams and noise pollution. Several studies have shown a direct relationship between speed and the severity of the accident. For example, according to the World Health Organization, a 1% reduction in speed will result in a 2% reduction in the accident. Also, it should be mentioned that the reduction of the speed limit does not constitute the solution to all the problems of road safety. When you drive slower, you are more likely to drive smoothly and keep a safe distance from other vehicles, which can result in a more organized traffic flow and less frustration and anxiety among drivers. So reducing the speed limit is a good way to increase road safety. However, it should be said that reducing the speed limit is an important step towards making the roads safer and, in combination with other measures, can significantly reduce accidents and fatalities.
1290;Many people believe that studying at university is the best way to develop oneself, learn new skills and find a well-paid job. Other people believe that more is learned from getting a job straight away after school and learning whilst working.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;There are many ways to learn new knowledge and skills. Traditional educational routes, such as school followed by college or university is one route that is generally accepted and respected by today’s society. It can be argued, however, that this is not always the best way. A more vocational route can be more appropriate for certain people and for particular jobs.Universities generally have deference given to them and, due to this, most schools tailor their programs to help students get university admission. Universities usually have respected and highly qualified teachers who have the knowledge and the skills to take their students to very high levels of knowledge and expertise. The very difficulty of gaining admission, getting through the duration of the course and passing final exams ensures to employers that graduates have the necessary self-discipline, intelligence and ability to get through the courses.Universities are also particularly well suited to the teaching of various subjects, for example, medicine, law and literature and these subjects need students’ full-time attention in order to do well. Although vocational experience is necessary, a certain grounding in basic concepts to a high-level is important. Once this knowledge has been acquired, students can then integrate their knowledge with practical understanding.This, however, is not the case for all areas of learning, especially ones where the quantity of high level knowledge is not required or is possible to be learned whilst working at the same time. Young people studying to be an electrician or a plumber are good examples. To do this work well requires a lot of experience, yet also a sound understanding of theory. The learning here can be and is done working and studying at the same time, often through apprenticeships and vocational courses involving significant amounts of work experience.Therefore, in my opinion, there are more ways than one to acquire a profession. Whether learning should take place at university alone or whilst working depends on the course and the end job.; Those who claim that university is the best way to achieve these goals believe that it provides a good foundation for the development of critical thinking, problem-solving and communication skills that are highly valued by employers. The organized learning environment and access to university resources, such as libraries, museums and laboratories, also help to develop one’s academic and personal abilities. On top of this, university degrees usually qualify students for careers in medicine, law and engineering. Others, however, argue that it is better to find a job right after graduation and learn on the job. This approach enables people to gain experience, develop specialized skills and earn a salary while they learn. To my mind, a combination of both is ideal, as university degrees provide a solid foundation, but practical, on-the-job training is essential for personal and professional development. The advantage of on-the-job learning is especially evident in fields where practical experience is more important than book knowledge, such as building, cooking or information technology. Furthermore, as the world of work becomes increasingly competitive and complex, a lifelong learning approach to career development is more necessary than ever. In recent years, universities have introduced a range of work experience programs, such as internships, cooperative education and project-based learning, which integrate practical experience into the curriculum. The combination of theoretical knowledge and practical experience can only benefit one’s career development. It gives students the flexibility to work in different industries and to adapt to the demands of their chosen career. To conclude, I think that a combination of on-the-job training and university study provides the most comprehensive approach to personal development and finding a good job.
1288;Many people in cities today live in high-rise apartment blocks. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this type of living?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;High-rise apartment blocks are a common sight in cities around the world. They are especially popular in large cities and in locations where building land is scarce. Living in such buildings has various advantages and disadvantages for town planners and the inhabitants themselves.The most significant advantage of high-rise apartment blocks is probably for the town planners. With land often being at a premium in large cities, one way to maximise space is to build upwards, so that the population density per square kilometre can be increased. The demand for housing in big cities can therefore be more easily met. There are also disadvantages for town planners. The heavier population density can put added pressure on social facilities, for example sewage and other waste disposal, and the provision of adequate school and medical services.There are also advantages and disadvantages for the actual inhabitants of high-rise apartment blocks. With the demand for housing being reduced, prices are therefore not as high, making housing more affordable. Many people also like not having to be responsible for a garden, and living in an apartment has this advantage. Finally, with so many people living in the same area, many friendships can be made and a community spirit can be built up. It appears the most significant disadvantage is that, in practice, living in high-rise apartment blocks is just not the lifestyle many people want. In some city neighbourhoods, these living spaces can often be associated with poor living conditions and undesirable social elements. In addition, many people view high-rise apartment blocks as being unsafe. For example, in the case of fire, tall buildings are difficult or impossible to evacuate safely.It is clear that high-rise apartment blocks have benefits and drawbacks. It is also clear, however, that due to the need to house increasing numbers of people in cities, these architectural features are here to stay, whether people like them or not.; On the one hand, high-rise apartment blocks have a lot of advantages. But it has disadvantages as well. Firstly, high-rise buildings can be built with more land than lower buildings, which is very useful for cities with a high population density, because building higher can accommodate more people in a smaller area and help save more green space. Secondly, high-rise buildings have a lot of modern facilities, such as swimming pools, gyms, and common rooms for residents. The quality of life of the residents is also improved. Thirdly, there are also very good views from the top floors of these buildings. For example, in Singapore, many people live in high-rise buildings, and they are very popular because of their security. Fourthly, the space is very cramped in high-rise buildings, which can lead to the annoyance of neighbors and the lack of personal space, which can cause some residents to be unhappy. On the other hand, there are many disadvantages of high-rise apartment buildings. First, the number of people in a building is very small, so the privacy of each family is very restricted. Second, there is a high dependence on elevators and other mechanical equipment, which can cause inconvenience to residents. For example, if there is a power failure, high-rise buildings are often difficult to live in, and the residents of the higher floors cannot enter their own homes. Thirdly, some people find that life in high-rise buildings affects their health. Finally, whether or not to live in high-rise buildings depends on the priorities of people's lives and the needs of their families.
789;Many people now undertake extreme activities, from hang-gliding to mountain climbing.Why do people risk their lives in this way, and do you think this is a good trend?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Extreme sports, such as mountain climbing and hand-gliding, have become increasingly popular over the past several decades. Now more than ever, athletes can be paid to do these activities full-time, encouraging more aspiring athletes to enter extreme sports. In addition, the addictive nature of these activities means that participants tend to stay in the sport for the thrill. While the increased popularity can result in more accidents, it can also make the sports safer as atheletes collectively learn from past mistakes.While people have undertaken extreme activities long before the advent of television and social media, these new platforms give extreme sports the much needed sponsorship and attention. Nowadays, outlandish and dangerous acts can be televised and monetized, giving the athletes a way to make a living out of these events. Therefore, more people would feel encouraged to participate in these activities knowing that they can have a decent income. On top of the external motivation, most extreme athletes take part in these sports because they are thrilling and addicting. These atheletes chase the rush and validation that they get when doing dangerous activities. As a result, even without the external rewards, some people would still partake in these sports.Given that people are motivated both internally and externally to participate in extreme sports, it is inevitable that these activities become more popular. While it is true that increased participation would result in more accidents, it would also create more lessons for future participants. In this way, these accidents and injuries would help educate future athletes on how to protect themselves. Moreoever, this increased popularity would also encourage governments to draft more safety regulations.In conclusion, given that it is human nature to want to achieve feats of strength and courage, extreme sports would always be attractive for some. Because of this, there will always be people injuring themselves while pursuing these feats. Therefore, these activities would become safer the more athletes learn from past incidents.; In recent years, many people have taken up extreme activities, from hang-gliding to bungee jumping and mountain climbing. Why do they risk their lives in this way? There are many reasons why they do so, but one reason is that they can overcome their fear of the activity. For example, mountain climbers who have climbed to the top of Mount Everest say they feel an intense sense of achievement, which makes them want to push themselves to even greater heights. I think this is due to a human desire for stimulation and the pleasure of taking risks. But although many people see this as a reckless and dangerous trend, I think it can have a positive effect, if it is undertaken carefully and with the proper training. It is true that the risk of extreme activities is very high, but it can lead to a greater sense of self-confidence and mental and physical wellbeing, which can be useful for individuals. Also, if the right precautions are taken and the right equipment is used, then it is possible to significantly reduce the risk of death. For example, rock climbing can develop strength, flexibility, and problem-solving skills, as well as teaching people perseverance and the ability to control themselves in risky situations. If people are prepared to take part in extreme activities with care, then I think it can have a positive effect on personal development.
1345;Many people support animal testing while others believe it isn’t appropriate (discuss);Many people support use of animals for testing medicines for humans. Others believe it isn’t appropriate to use animals for such experiments. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayApproval of the medicines for human use is a tedious process which involves a series of tests often performed on animals. While some people support this idea because it makes drugs safer for human consumption, others believe that it is an unethical practice. Personally, I am in favour of the idea that medicines should be tested in all possible scenarios before being released to the public.Those against animal experimentation argue that animals have the same rights as human beings because they are the outcome of the same evolution process through which humans came into existence. Infecting them with viruses and exposing them to bacteria, to create a conducive environment to test a chemical substance may cause excruciating pain to these lab animals. Any failed test can mean that the subject either loses its precious life or suffers for the rest of its existence, and understandably, some people are against what they consider an immoral practice.Nonetheless, if a drug is released into the market without a thorough end-to-end testing, it could cause severe damage to anyone who may consume it. Every day a large number of animals are being mercilessly killed by humans for their mere flesh and skin. There isn’t a big difference between killing an animal for food and sacrificing its life for testing a chemical composition, because both actions are helping the human race to survive. What’s more, the life of one animal used to test a life-saving drug could help many people live. This is why a large number of people believe that testing drugs on animals is a matter of survival.To sum up, there are valid reasons why animal testing seems cruel and unacceptable to some, and crucial to others. In my opinion, even though animals subjected to testing may suffer, it is a necessary step to ensure the healing power of a drug.; , some people say that animal testing is a necessary step in the development of medical treatment and a cure for diseases. Animal testing is a disputed issue. On the one hand, many people consider animal testing inhumane because of animal cruelty and the ethical question of using living creatures for scientific research. Animal experiments, for example, allowed the development of the polio vaccine, which has saved countless lives. Animal experiments also allow the testing of new drugs and side effects in a controlled environment, thus reducing the risk of harm to humans. Furthermore, with the development of technology, it is now possible to replace animal experiments with other methods such as in vitro and simulation, which reduces the need for animal experiments. On the other hand, many people argue that animals can feel, suffer and suffer, so it is morally wrong to use them for experiments. However, as technology develops, it is possible that alternative methods will replace animal experiments. In the end, the advantages and disadvantages of animal testing must be taken into account in order to conduct medical research in a responsible and ethical manner.
327;Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. Do you agree or disagree?;It is undeniable that nowadays, smart devices such as phones and tablets play an essential role in one's life. Through countless websites and applications, people can connect with each other without any boundaries. While many people agree that the introduction of these technologies has many disadvantages to the conservative way of starting and maintaining relationships, I personally believe that they rather develop new socializing methods.First and foremost, social medias and applications can help with keeping in touch with acquintances. Previously, people had to follow a precise time and location to meet up with their friends as they are unable to contact the others to reschedule. However, the internet allows them to update their plans at any time. This means that if there is any emergency, an individual can immediately postpone the upcoming event and find the next available slot to continue the plan. Furthermore, there are several applications that allow people to video call their friends and family who are currently living apart.The current technologies not only offer us options to communicate with our current contacts but also allow us to discover new friends. In the past, it is difficult to find people with a common interest which had to be done through social events. Nowadays, online communities enable their users to connect with new friends virtually. Thus, fewer individuals are left alone, especially introverts and those who are living in remote areas which can have difficulties socializing offline.All in all, despite the fact that there are many positive impacts of the invention of social medias and communication technologies, there are also risks and downsides of using them without face-to-face communication. Therefore, the time used for socializing online and offline should always be balanced.; This is my answer: While modern technology makes it possible for us to communicate faster and more easily, many people say that it has had a negative impact on social relationships. I agree with this view. On the one hand, it has become easier for people to communicate with each other over long distances, but on the other hand, face-to-face conversations, which are the foundation for meaningful relationships, have become rarer. People now have many more acquaintances on the Internet, but their social relationships have become less deep and meaningful. People have hundreds of friends on the Internet, but they do not feel any closer to them. In my opinion, the deterioration of face-to-face communication, the creation of an artificial feeling of being close to people, and the encouragement of unrealistic expectations are all serious disadvantages. Besides, the constant flow of information on the Internet can lead to the formation of unrestrained consumption and dissatisfaction, which can further lead to a sense of isolation and alienation from people. Awareness of these negative aspects can make us use modern communication technology in a way that is complementary to human relationships, rather than damaging them. To maintain the harmony of relationships, it is necessary to balance technology and real life.
837;Many people today, especially in the developed world, are choosing to have fewer children, or none at all.Why is this happening, and do you think it is a good trend?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Weather to have children or not is one of the most important questions young adults have to ask themselfs nowadays. Overpopulation is one of the many global problems next to climate change, and poverty.In my opinion, the need to have children roots back to us being nothing more, but civilised animals. Animals have one goal above all; reproduce. This is why in many cultures, men and women who cannot have chlidren are seen as disabled, or sick. Nowadays, modern values changed our perspective, having children is often seen as a necessity for a happy, and successful life.It is important to recognise the problems the developed world faces. There is smoke in the air, plastic pollution everywhere, poverty in third world countries, and many other factors that make Earth a terrible place for many. Above all, the life we give birth to will have to eat, drink, and consume just like everyone else, using more and more of the already limited resources, generating more and more trash.Many people argue that the above mentioned points are a pessimistic and unrealistic. Humans have to reproduce, to keep the species from extintion. And truthfully the only way to do that, is to give birth as many kids as possible. This issue lies deep in our society; here in Hungary, a family is rewared almost 30000 USD if they have 3 or more kids. This means that many people have children because they get money for it, and they are also seen socially accepted.I believe modern day intelligence goes further than IQ points and money earned. We have to recognise the problems created, overpopulation being one of them. While I do not believe that we should not have kids, I think there should be careful planning involved and self-reflection before giving birth to new life."; To have fewer children or none at all is a trend that is especially seen in the developed world. In many countries the cost of education, health and child care has risen drastically in recent decades, making it harder for people to meet their financial obligations. Another important factor is the changing social priorities: the increasing rights of women and the demand for gender equality have made it possible for many women to work and to develop themselves before having a family. As a result, many couples choose to have fewer children or none at all to preserve their economic situation. Some may find this development bad, but I believe it has its advantages. For example, fewer children can mean a better quality of life for both the parents and the child. There is also a greater availability of birth control and other resources for family planning, which gives the opportunity to make an informed decision. To conclude, the trend of having fewer children or none at all is a complex issue with several factors. The parents can focus more on their child and the child will be in a more secure and healthier environment. On the other hand, the decision to have fewer children or none at all is a personal choice and people should have the opportunity to make an informed choice about their health and family planning. In my opinion, there are also disadvantages to this development, for example declining population and aging populations, but I believe it also has advantages.
1317;Many people try to achieve a work-life balance but fail. Why is this happening? What can be done to help people overcome this problem?;Many people strive to achieve a work-life balance, but often find themselves failing despite their best efforts. This is not surprising, as balancing work and life commitments can be extremely difficult due to both having their unique stressors.One of the major reasons why so many people struggle to achieve harmony between their personal and professional lives is that now it is easier than ever for people to stay connected outside of regular work hours. This has led to an expectation that employees should always be available, and they risk being seen as unreliable or uncommitted if they are not. A knock-on effect of longer working hours is that little time is left for leisure activities such as socialising or engaging in hobbies or sports, which help reduce stress levels and improve overall well-being. This type of pressure and lack of free time can lead to feelings of burnout, with no respite from life’s pressures, resulting in chronic fatigue and diminished motivation over time.Helping those struggling to find a suitable work-life balance will require joint efforts of managers and employees. Workers, for instance, need to recognise the importance of taking regular breaks throughout the day and getting enough sleep each night, while employers should consider being more flexible when it comes to allowing staff to work remotely and offering paid vacation days. This will give employees space, both mentally and physically, enabling them to better manage their commitments without overextending themselves.In conclusion, achieving a successful work-life balance is something that many cannot quite reach due to external pressures from employers and a lack of downtime. However, these issues can be overcome, if we create realistic boundaries between our professional lives and personal goals, and make conscious decisions about how we want to spend our time.; Despite the efforts made to achieve a balance between the demands of the workplace and the demands of personal life, many people find it difficult to cope. The ever-increasing demands of the workplace have led to this failure. The other major reason is a lack of effective time management. Many people find it difficult to cope with all their responsibilities, and this leads to a lack of balance between their personal and their professional life. Also, technological advances mean that employees are expected to be available round the clock. This has resulted in a loss of balance between their personal and their professional life. To overcome this problem, there are several things that people can do. Firstly, they can set limits between their personal and professional life. For example, they can allocate a specific time for work and try not to think about work during their personal time. Finally, they can put less emphasis on work and more emphasis on their personal life. The success of this depends on the efforts made by both the individual and the employer. The first thing an individual can do is to develop effective time management skills, such as prioritizing responsibilities and saying no to unimportant work commitments. Also, the employer can encourage flexible working arrangements, such as working from home or flexible working hours. A person who values his personal life and places it higher than his professional life will overcome the difficulties of achieving a work-life balance and this will give him a better life.
1298;Many schoolchildren today take part in work experience sessions for short periods of time instead of attending school. Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It has been a popular trend for some time now to put children into what can be called ‘work experience placements’. The children are taken out of school and take part in various types of work, usually for around a week. Some people criticise this trend, but I can’t see how it can be a negative experience.One of the criticisms is that children lose a week of schoolwork. With the pressure to do well at school increasing, children need every bit of help to maximise their potential. Taking them out of the school, it is therefore argued, stops them from getting access to needed education for a whole week. As the students won’t really be of much help to a workplace for just one week, it would therefore be better for them to remain at school.While this is a valid point, taking a child’s entire experience of school into account, a single week away does not make a significant difference. Indeed, if the timing of the week’s work placements is done correctly, the week can also serve as a kind of ‘holiday’ away from school, something that is regularly needed in order to allow students to remain fresh and enthusiastic. In many work placements, children also get to see some of things they learn at school put into a realistic context, allowing them to understand the relevance of what they learn and thereby creating a way to reinforce the learning.In addition to this, schoolchildren can be quite nervous about the world of work that they will have to join at some point in their lives. By getting this short taste of what it is like, they can see that it is nothing to be scared about. As well as this, children will often have some ideas of what they want to do for a living, but are not sure. By allowing them to see a type of work they are considering, they are better able to decide whether that career could be suitable for them.I feel, therefore, that work placements can be seen as a positive development. Missing a short amount of school is not serious and the benefits that can be gained from the placements are significant.; I believe that this development is largely positive. Work experience is a way to teach practical skills and give students an opportunity to observe how things are done in the workplace. In addition, students learn how to work independently and in a team. This can be particularly useful for students who are unsure of their future career path and want to try out different areas. Students also have more opportunities for employment after graduation. For example, a student who participates in a work experience program in a hospital can acquire experience in the care of patients, medical terminology and the work of the hospital administration. This is a good basis for further education. However, there may be objections that work experience sessions take time away from studying and can affect the student’s performance and understanding of some important topics. Many employers value practical work experience, and students have an advantage in the job market. Students are also provided with practical skills and work experience that is useful for their future careers and for life. Nevertheless, work experience is an important part of education, which can contribute to the student’s personal development.
1413;Millions of people every year move to English- speaking countries such as Australia, Britain or America, in order to study at school, college or university.

They are able to compete with other countries because many people in China English language and they are trying hard to study English.Secondly, many companies prefer to employ people who can speak English because if the companies create new in different countries, the employers are able to move the new branch without new people and the branch company is still able to communicate with the central company. In fact, one of the largest companies in the world (Google) has created some in different countries and each of the Google is able to discuss things or otherwise communicate even though they are in different countries because they all use English to communicate.In conclusion, many people move to English speaking countries for further studies because they believe that it will improve their English skills and in order to become a successful person in the future, mastering English is .; An important reason for this is that English has become the international language that people use to communicate with people from other countries and cultures.

795;Missions to explore space are hugely expensive, and there are problems on Earth which demand attention. The number of these missions needs to be reduced.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is supposed by many, that high-cost space studies should be cut off while more focus should be paid to the challenges mankind face on Earth. This essay completely disargees with such view because of two reasons that will de developed further.The first reason is that only rich countries spend thier budgets for space studies. This means that only when states have resolved most of their problems with poverty, level of medicine treatment, safety, they can divert some of the funds to invest in future technologies. Moreover, citizens will go on a strike and make the govenment to deal with real life problems instead of dreaming about the space. For example, not more than 5% of USA GDP is spent on space programs that is sufficient to progress, construct new sputniks, and send astronauts to the Internations Space Station.The second argument supposes that many space technologies have a dual puropose. In other words, being initially developed for studing the space, they were adopted to make people's day-to-day life easier. For example, mobile phones and the mobile Internet, navigaion using GPS would not be possibe if people were not trying to explore space.In conclusion, new technologies are developed when people are trying to learn the world outside our planet. This; I disagree that the number of space missions should be reduced. Space exploration has led to many discoveries and inventions which have made our lives better, such as GPS technology, memory foam, and water purification systems. NASA’s Earth-observing system has mapped and analyzed global climate patterns, giving scientists useful information to develop plans to prevent the worst effects of climate change. In addition, the European Space Agency is developing useful ways to manage resources like a better irrigation system and to predict drought. Besides, space exploration can help us solve some of the world’s most pressing problems, like climate change and depletion of natural resources. Instead of cutting the number of space missions, governments and space agencies should plan their resources and operations more carefully, so that they can be as cost-effective as possible. This can be achieved by collaborating with private companies and focusing on missions which can bring the greatest benefit to humanity. As a result, even though there are many problems on Earth, space exploration should be considered an investment in the future of humanity. The SpaceX partnership between NASA and a private company has led to both cost savings and improvements in space technology.
1434;Modern medicine helps to live a longer life. Do you agree?;"The modern medicine is very important for living a long life. It on new technology. . Also modern medicine is human body. . Therefore I agree that the modern medicine to live longer.First of all, the modern medicine can prevent incurable diseases. Doctors can find some diseases very early. Then doctors can give suitable medicines to patients. New modern doctors . Also intelligent people in the world live a long life modern medicine. That is very important in the human society because their creative things are coming with them and they can help others for a longer time when they are living ., old population is increasing in the country. It is country’s economy and third world countries. But old people are very important in human society because their experience definitely helps to . ‘Experience is better than qualifications’ However, old people are living a long life; it is helping others to live a long life because we can get advice from them and they are covering our culture and society.Moreover, modern medicine is being addictive for some people, so that they cannot live without medicine.

In the modern medicine human kindness. People who have money can take modern medicine. But indigenous medicine has well human friendly shape. It does not depend on money.To summarize; in my personal view, modern medicine is helping to live a long life . Modern technologies are being supported to find diseases very early. So doctors can take immediately. Therefore, hesitate to agree with the above mentioned statement.Your essay has several confusing sentences, where your meaning is unclear.You mix advantages and disadvantages of the modern medicine in one paragraph when you should divide them – have advantages in one paragraph and disadvantages in another.If you agree with the statement, you should have 2 paragraphs supporting your opinion and one supporting the opposite opinion, in your essay it is 2 against and 1 for."; I strongly agree with this statement. It is a fact that the development of medicine, technology and medical treatment has had a great influence on the process of disease and its treatment, so that human life has increased significantly. Countless lives have been saved by the discovery of antimagnetics, which have cured bacterial infections, and the number of lives saved by the development of new methods of cancer treatment has increased, which has improved the survival rate of many types of cancer. The main reason for the increase in life expectancy is the fact that the discovery of new methods of treatment for incurable diseases has been made. Another important factor is the improvement in preventive medicine. Immunization, regular checkups and the possibility of screening are now an integral part of the modern medical system, which allows for early detection and prevention of diseases. Also, the development of organ transplants and surgical procedures have increased the chances of prolonging human life. Furthermore, in recent years, a more active approach to healthy life habits, such as balanced nutrition, regular exercise and stress management, has been established, contributing to a longer and healthier life. In conclusion, it is obvious that modern medicine has had a positive influence on human life expectancy. And I firmly believe that it is the determining factor for the length and quality of human life. The significant development of medical treatment, preventive medicine and health care has led to an increase in life expectancy. As medical research continues, it is likely that human health and longevity will continue to increase.
1315;More and more people today are drinking sugar-based drinks. Why is this happening? What measures can be taken to reverse this trend?;An alarming number of people today consume sugar-based drinks, whether it is in the form of soda, energy drinks or fruit drinks. Often consumers are lured by their widespread availability and convenience, however, marketing campaigns also play a role, targeting young people and giving them the perception that sugary drinks are not as unhealthy as they actually are.The availability of these types of drinks has greatly increased over time. They can now be found in almost any store or restaurant, which makes them easily accessible to almost anyone. The fact that they are often cheaper than alternatives, such as water or freshly squeezed juice, makes them an especially attractive option for those on a budget. Marketing campaigns for sugary beverages have been quite successful in creating positive associations attached to these products through advertisements on TV and billboards. This encourages people to consider them fun rather than unhealthy and normalises them within society.Luckily, reversing the rise in popularity of sugary drinks is still possible, if we act now and attack the problem from different angles. One of the very first steps should be educating people on the health risks associated with high sugar intake so that they can make better-informed decisions when selecting what type of beverage they consume. Companies should also be held accountable by law for their misleading marketing campaigns aimed at children and teenagers who are more likely to believe the false claims about their products’ health benefits without fully understanding what’s being sold to them. Schools, colleges and universities, and any institutions catering for young people, should consider banning sugary drinks and replacing them with refreshing alternatives without added sugar.Overall, it is important that we recognise the potential health risks posed by consuming too much sugar from soft drinks and take actionable steps towards reversing this trend in order to ensure our long-term wellbeing. Through greater education, government regulation, and increased corporate responsibility we can ensure that more people understand why reducing their intake of sugary beverages is important while still allowing them to access enjoyable yet healthier options.; There are many reasons for this development. For example, sugar-based drinks are widely available in shops, restaurants and in vending machines. Sugar-based drinks are therefore easily available and are therefore easy to take. A further reason is that people are not sufficiently informed about the health risks of sugar-based drinks. For example, many people do not know that sugar-based drinks cause obesity, diabetes and tooth decay. On the other hand, sugar-based drinks are marketed with great success, especially among young people, in the form of attractively designed cans and exciting advertisements. In order to stop this development, various measures can be taken. For example, governments and health organizations can organize awareness-raising campaigns to inform people about the harmful effects of sugar-based drinks on their health. As a result, people are able to drink these beverages without taking their health into consideration. Schools and workplaces can also encourage people to drink water and other low-sugar drinks. In addition, sugar-based drinks can be taxed so that people are less likely to take them. This requires a common effort from governments, organizations and individuals in order to promote a healthier drinking culture. With these measures, it is possible to reduce the consumption of sugar-based drinks and to promote a healthier lifestyle.
1259;More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Over the past decades, it has been registered a considerable decrease in the percentage of people eager to create a family at a young age. There could be different reasons for this and I am going to state them clearly in the following paragraphs, which will also explain why I believe the advantages of this situation far outweigh the disadvantages.Apparently, the society we currently live in has undergone substantial changes over the years, sometimes without us even noticing it. The most evident of these variations has probably been the gradual rise in the number of old people as opposed to the dramatic fall in the number of births. In fact, owing to the decline of the economy of most nations and the subsequent reduction of work opportunities, more and more people are giving up on the idea of becoming parents in their 20s or 30s. Many people see this as a negative aspect for our society; however, I have to strongly disagree with their opinion.The drawbacks to which a lot of people point out when discussing about these kind of topics often has to do with the age gap between parents and their children. Admittedly, someone cannot decide to have a child in their 40s without considering the significant generation gap that would separate them from their kids and, as a result, the issues of miscommunication that could arise.However, the disadvantages become of secondary importance as soon as the much more remarkable benefits are examined. First of all, older parents also means more responsible and mature caretakers; consequently, due to their broader life experience, they would arguably make better advisors for their kids. Not to mention that older parents would not only have more stable and secure jobs, but they would also have more consistent savings to devote to their children's further education, which in turn could help the latter having a better and well-paid job in the future.To conclude, although it's impossible not to take into account the drawbacks of having a child at a more advanced age, the advantages still outrun the disadvantages. Thus, children would be the first to benefit from such a situation."; Discuss both views and give your own opinion. In recent years, the tendency to postpone childbearing has become more noticeable. This can be explained by many factors, including career success, the need for financial security and maturity. A couple in their early forties has more income and better prospects than when they were twenty-five and they can afford to give their children a good education and other advantages. Also, as the parents become older, they are more emotionally mature and can better control their children's development. In my opinion, the advantages of later childbearing outweigh the disadvantages. But there are disadvantages to be considered. The parents of the older generation have less energy and health problems. In conclusion, the decision to have children is a personal matter, but many parents who are older can be wise and have a lot to gain. With the development of medical technology and the longer life expectancy, the risks of childbearing can be minimized.
1425;Most high level positions in companies are filled by men, even though the workforce in many developed countries consists of 50 percent female workers. Companies should be required to allocate a certain percentage of management positions to women. Discuss, what is your opinion?;"The inequality between men and women has always been a significant issue in society. , it is undeniable that most vital positions in companies are taken by males, not females. Therefore, that companies should allocate to women a certain number of these positions. However, I do not agree with this requirement completely.In some feudal countries, it was true to say that the society the males, and at that time instances of inequality occurred very frequently. Up until the present moment, it in some developing countries; also it is greatly . A large number of women in these countries are not allowed to go to work or even go to . In this case, this is not an individual issue, but social problem. The governments should have some solution to this tendency, and at the same time they should promulgate a new legislation to protect women’s .On the other hand, the global economy is developing rapidly nowadays. In most corporations, distinguish men from women; they only focus on working efficiently. In this world, any employees who possess enough abilities and work in an effective way, be promoted to positions. Therefore, allocating the high level positions in companies to women is not necessary. Moreover, the instances of women in essential positions . Those women are very successful in their work and their lives.In conclusion, although the inequality between men and women has reduced, it still is a social issue worth . Personally, in my opinion we should create as many opportunities for women to have an equal life as we can."; In my opinion, a law requiring companies to allocate a certain percentage of management positions to women is an important step towards achieving greater equality between the sexes in the workplace. In many developed countries women are still underrepresented in managerial positions despite their greater participation in the labor market. In many companies there are unconscious biases, and women often face discrimination and stereotyping which hinder their career advancement. The introduction of quotas would force companies to examine their recruitment and promotion policies in order to ensure that women are given an equal opportunity to compete for top positions. This measure would help to eliminate systemic barriers and biases that prevent women from reaching the top. Women bring unique skills, experiences and perspectives to the workplace which can be useful for companies in devising more effective and successful business strategies. The introduction of quotas would bring many benefits to companies. They would have access to a wider talent pool, a greater diversity of views and perspectives, which would lead to better decisions and more effective performance. In order to increase the proportion of women in managerial positions, companies must focus on promoting a supportive and inclusive environment, promoting their personal and professional development and addressing any underlying biases. However, it is essential to ensure that such a policy is carefully implemented in order to avoid the introduction of tokenism and that women are not appointed merely to fill quotas, but on the basis of merit. I believe that this measure would help to eliminate systemic barriers that hinder the advancement of women, bring many benefits to companies and ultimately lead to more diverse and effective leadership.
1390;News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in a newspaper. What factors do you think influence their decisions? Do we become used to bad news? Would it be better if more good news was reported?;. There are two factors that influence their decisions. The first is the kind of customers they aim at. each kind of readers and watchers has its own features. For example, if your customers are almost entirely teenagers, you have to concentrate on something attracting them such as stories, photographs of singer stars, film stars, funny tales, and fashion. It be very silly if you to provide teenagers with economic or news. On the contrary, and politicians may never read news about James Blunt or Keira Knightley. Therefore, what influences news editors’ decisions the most is the taste of their customers.The second factor is how hot and attractive the news is. Who or watch news from a year or a month ago or even about something that happened last week? The answer is . In the energetic and competitive world nowadays, people always ask for a really news. So that to satisfy customers, there is a pressure on all editors to find continually what has already happened not only yesterday but even an hour ago. Or else, they may lose their customers. None of editors wants that bleak future.The type of news is also an important consideration. Whether on television or in newspapers, we seem to get more of and become used to bad news. It is harder for us to come across a piece of good news. We can’t deny that bad things happen on Earth day by day. However, news editors try to gain more and more , which means more and more money, using bad news as a magnet. bad news makes us curious. We want to know why it is bad, what it is about, whether it influences us or not. As a result, we will buy newspapers or watch television to find out. And the happiest people are, of course, news editors.In my view it would be better if more good news reported. Bad news makes us good news makes us happy. There should an an equal amount of good and bad news. In that way we can give something bad a lot of thought while still being happy about the good news. Any inequalities between good news and bad news should be avoided. Nowadays we cannot live without news, and for that reason the role of news editors became very important. We should support them, and in turn they should try their best to provide us with useful news, both good and bad.; How do you feel about the decision to publish a report that the news editor does not like? Several factors affect their decision, the most important of which are the importance and relevance of the report for the public, and the editor’s decision to keep it out of the paper or to postpone it for the benefit of the public. Another factor that influences the decision is commercial, the intention of attracting an advertising clientele and good ratings. Generally, editors are inclined to choose stories that are more likely to stir up public interest, such as scandals, disasters or wars. Then, too, the availability of resources, time and money, are a consideration. As a result, bad news is often dominating because it is more attention-getting and profitable. And since we are so often exposed to negative reports, we are gradually becoming accustomed to them. The competition between the media, moreover, heightens the pressure to break the story first and leads to the possibility of sensationalism rather than quality reporting. On the other hand, reporting more good news would bring a more optimistic and balanced view of the world, as well as inspiration, with reports on successful initiatives, heroic acts, or resilency and hope. This might have a profound effect on the public’s attitude and result in stress and anxiety, and a more pessimistic view of life. In short, though the decision of news editors is complex and difficult, there is a compelling case for reporting more good news. Reporting it could help to make people more informed, resilent and rejoicing in their lives. It might even encourage individuals and communities to em-ulate positive behaviour and work towards a better society. To sum up, we need a good balance of reports on both the distressing and the rejoicing.
1321;Newspapers have a significant influence on people’s ideas and opinions. Why is this happening? Is it a positive or negative situation?;Many people believe that newspapers play a pivotal role in shaping the way we think. There are numerous ways in which this affects our society, and I believe that this influence is mostly negative.Newspapers have long been a source of valuable information that has kept societies abreast of the latest happenings in the world. Since the average citizen has minimal knowledge about the information in expert analysis articles, well-established newspapers are powerfully poised to form public opinion through attention-grabbing images and carefully worded commentary. This leaves the reader no choice but to trust the accuracy of what they have read.Sadly, unbiased objectivity, which used to be the core idea behind journalism, seems to be a thing of the past. The arrival and spread of social media platforms has caused a gradual decline in print media subscriptions and their circulation, since readers tend to favor the internet and social media to stay informed about current affairs. This gave rise to a worrying trend of newspapers using sensationalist and controversial tactics to improve their sales. As a result, the constant barrage of bad news has led to a society that sees itself as more vulnerable and powerless than ever. To make matters worse, there are plenty of well-documented instances where newspapers have been used to spread false propaganda which is usually politically motivated.All in all, although newspapers are our lifeline to the world around us, the recent trend of publishing misinformation has had a mostly negative impact on readers. It is my hope that newspapers will go back to publishing impartial accounts of the latest news in the future.; Firstly, newspapers provide a variety of opinions on many issues, which makes it possible for the reader to have a more comprehensive view of many things. Secondly, people have to be able to debate various points of view. The influence of newspapers can be both positive and negative. On the one hand, the newspapers play an important role in the education and enlightenment of the people. On the other hand, the newspapers sometimes have special articles that influence the opinions of readers, their opinions and decisions. The newspapers are a source of information and inspiration for many readers, but they also cause negative influence by bias and sensationalism. In addition, newspapers can develop critical thinking and lead to debate and discussion. In conclusion, newspapers have a significant influence on people's ideas and opinions. This influence is complex and ambiguous and is both positive and negative. In addition, the concentration of newspaper ownership in the hands of a few individuals or companies causes a homogenization of opinions and discourages diversity. It is important for newspaper readers to be aware of both the advantages and disadvantages of this influential medium and to use it in the best way to develop critical thinking and to make informed and responsible citizens. Newspapers can educate, inform and develop critical thinking, but they can also sway readers' opinions and mislead them.
1391;Nowadays environmental problems are too big to be managed by individual persons or individual countries. In other words, it is an international problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;An essential problem of the 21st century is world pollution. Currently the environment is so contaminated that urgent measures should be taken. A single individual cannot be blamed for the world pollution, however every person should take care of his or her habitat. In addition, it is vital that environmental issues are treated internationally.Lately, many presentations, conferences and international summits are held to deal with waste treatment, recycling, and soil and water contamination. joint efforts and consolidation can only help in the mutual war the ongoing environmental disaster. For instance, governments should offer support to companies and organizations, involved in manufacturing, industry or agriculture in order to find environment-friendly approaches. These could be special law regulations, recycling programs, helping courses in order to implement ISO certificates and many more.However, the influence of individuals over environment should not be ignored. If we do not that our planet is our home, we will never be able to take care of it. We have to contribute every day to the preservation of nature and environment. For example, always remember to save energy by switching off lamps, computers and everything that we do not use. Our next obligation is to separate waste and throw bulk only in the designated areas. Driving vehicles can also be environment friendly. For example, we have to avoid accelerating the engines too rapidly or using the air conditioning in the country, where it would be better to save energy and simply open the windows.To sum up, environmental problems should be handled by local and international authorities as well as individuals. Every single person should take care of the environment, moreover we have to bring up our children to be conscious citizens of a clean and preserved planet.; I strongly agree with the statement that today's environmental problems are an international problem, requiring the combined efforts of the world community. First, the world's environment is so closely connected that a global approach is necessary. Secondly, it is very difficult for individual countries to solve these problems alone, despite their best efforts. For example, the greenhouse effect that causes global warming affects many countries at the same time, because one country's greenhouse gas emissions can affect global weather and climate, thus affecting the well-being of many countries. Also the contamination of the seas with waste and harmful chemicals has become an international problem. It is necessary to share knowledge, technology and financial resources among countries. Individual countries, especially less developed countries, cannot cope with these problems alone, because they have limited resources. In conclusion, because of the international dimension of the environment and the limits of national action, it is clear that the environment requires a combined and international approach. International agreements such as the Paris Agreement and international programs to reduce emissions, protect biological diversity and support sustainable development are important steps in the right direction.
1368;Nowadays families move to different countries for work and some think it has a negative effect on children (agree/disagree);Nowadays families move to different countries for work. Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Recent advancements, in technology and transportation in particular, are reshaping our world in an unprecedented manner. Nowadays, it is not unusual for people to work abroad. Most expatriates relocate their families to the countries . Some people argue that this phenomenon negatively affects children, however, I agree with those who believe the opposite is true.Those who think that relocating children to a new place is undesirable do so for many reasons. Their most common argument is the negative impact of moving on a child’s personality. There is no doubt that living in a different community comes with its challenges, especially to young people, as they get exposed to behaviours, actions and customs they might not be familiar with. As a result, children could possibly feel a lack of stability and some confusion. It is also likely that their patriotic feelings and sense of belonging to their home country could weaken as they would miss many opportunities to celebrate their national events.Nevertheless, I firmly believe that opinion to be ludicrous, as it seems that getting exposed to a new culture is beneficial in many ways. It fosters young social and emotional capabilities. Moreover, children living abroad have better opportunities to and practice new languages. Mastering more than one language improves not only their intellectual development, but also their opportunities in acquiring better jobs in the future. According to a recent study published by the University of Chicago, competency in more than one language increases employment chances on average by 200%.In conclusion, I strongly believe that living in a different country positively affects children in all aspects. Acquiring new languages, and an open minded and tolerant personality are just few examples of the many possible benefits.This essay presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt. The writer’s ideas are relevant and well‐supported. The arrangement of information and use of cohesive devices are fine, perhaps with a slight overuse in the second body paragraph. Sentence structures are complex, and the vocabulary is varied and appropriately used, except for some minor grammatical/spelling mistakes. This essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.; , I think it can have a lot of advantages for children. On the one hand, moving to a new country can be a difficult thing for children because they have to adapt to a new place, new school and new friends, so they may feel lonely and unprepared. But on the other hand, they may have a lot of opportunities to learn and grow up in the new country and it is a source of education and development. Learning a new language, making friends from different cultures and experiencing life in a new place can make children more empathetic and optimistic. The child who experiences a transfer is more likely to be open-minded, curious and empathetic. Consequently, although moving to a new country can be a difficult thing for children, I think the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. Moreover, many companies and organizations offer a good support system for international families, such as international schools, clubs, and other communities, so that children can adapt to their new environment and feel a sense of belonging to their new country. Ultimately, moving to a new country can be a valuable and enriching experience for children, which can shape their future and broaden their horizons.
1350;Nowadays many people choose ready-made food and refuse to cook at home, why and what are the advantages/disadvantages?;Nowadays many people choose ready-made food and refuse to cook at home. Why do you think it happens? What are the advantages and disadvantages of such a choice?It is a very popular practice in the modern society to order ready-made food from restaurants, rather than cooking at home. The main reasons for such a tendency may be cheap prices in some restaurants and people’s desire to save some time . Even though ordering food some obvious advantages, its disadvantages should not be underestimated.On the one hand, ordering prepared food may be the best choice for a busy person, who does not have time for cooking and cleaning. Cooking food at home requires a considerable amount of time, moreover the cleaning process may take even more time and resources than cooking itself. For example, cooking a simple dish such as chicken with rice home requires significant amounts of water and electricity for electrical appliances such as the oven and dishwasher. Hence, having an opportunity to order food from a restaurant will save a lot of time, electricity and water.On the other hand, delegating the process of cooking to some restaurant a dramatic disadvantage of not having the information about the ingredients used in the meals. With high demand, grow the volumes of required products, which sometimes can affect the quality of purchased produce. For example, it is a very common practice in some restaurants to make salads from products that are about to go bad and mask the rotten scent by adding some chemicals and spices. Hence, some restaurants may use poor quality products or chemicals for boosting taste and preservatives, which may have a negative effect on the customer’s health in the long run.In conclusion, ordering food from restaurants may be a tempting choice for people who have no time for cooking at home, but this approach has a critical disadvantage of being not informed about the ingredients used in the meal, which can have destructive consequences.This response covers the task requirements by giving a reason why people would choose to buy ready-made food and discussing the advantages and disadvantages of this trend. The ideas are conveyed quite clearly and supported by examples, paragraphing helps to present the information in a neat and easy to follow way, and the level of coherence is adequate in this essay. A range of complex sentence forms and advanced vocabulary is used and there are very few instances of erroneous grammar or inaccurate expressions (see corrections underlined in blue). Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.; Your topic is: Ready-made food has become an important part of our life in the modern world. The reason is that in the midst of a bustling life it is often difficult to find time to cook food. Another reason for the popularity of ready-made food is the diversity of its content. There are various cuisines and various dishes, which enable consumers to taste various tastes and eat without cooking. For those who have no time to cook, the choice of quick and easy food is more and more popular. Despite the diversity of ready-made food, there are also some disadvantages, especially for the health. In the city, people have many choices for eating. On the one hand, the advantage of ready-made food is the public. Compared to home cooking, the ingredients are fresher, and the nutritional value can be controlled, which is not the case for ready-made food. But on the other hand, the socialization of the crowd is also the advantage of ready-made food. This is because in the midst of the bustle of life, it is often a good choice to go out with friends, have dinner with the family, or go to work with colleagues. Eating and talking with the crowd are also the choices of relaxation and communication. In short, the convenience, diversity and socialization of ready-made food are also the health hazards, and the nutrients and the benefits of home cooking are more accurate and more personal. Both are to be enjoyed, but in the form of more advantages.
1316;Nowadays many teenagers have a celebrity who they follow as a role model. Some people think this is not a good idea, because celebrities often set a bad example. Do you agree or disagree?;It is not uncommon for teenagers to worship celebrities. From singers to actors, many young people around the world look up to these stars and attempt to emulate their lifestyles. In my opinion, allowing children to idolize celebrities can often be detrimental, as they frequently set a poor example.Many of today’s celebrities tend to lack moral values, and they promote behaviour inappropriate for young people. For instance, some music videos feature explicit lyrics glorifying drug use and violence. In addition, the media often reports on celebrities who indulge in excessive partying or drinking alcohol despite being underage. These types of headlines can have a negative influence on impressionable teens who might falsely believe that they should follow suit to appear cool or successful.Poor morals aren’t the only issue, as many popular stars are also well-known for their irresponsible spending habits. They routinely splurge on luxury items such as designer clothing or expensive cars without any consideration for budgeting or saving money responsibly. This kind of behaviour is dangerous because it is normalizing materialism and teaching teens that costly possessions will bring them happiness instead of focusing on what really matters in life: meaningful relationships, knowledge, and hard work.To conclude, young adults should keep in mind that society’s perception of fame and fortune is based on temporary, insubstantial things rather than what actually matters. In the grand scheme of things, it would be far more beneficial for teenagers to spend time developing their own set of values rooted in quality education and strong family relationships.; One reason why celebrities are criticized is that they are always under the microscope, so to speak, and their behavior is magnified. This is the reason why many people believe that it is not a good idea for young people to choose a celebrity as a role model. Such people often lead an unhealthy lifestyle, indulge in excessive indulgence in their pampered position, and have no interest in the important issues. This could lead to long-term and bad consequences for young people's health and personal development. However, it should also be mentioned that not all celebrities set a bad example. The continuous exposure to celebrity culture on social media platforms can create an illusion of beauty, and encourage consumerism among young people. But celebrities who use their fame for a good cause, or work hard and persistently, can inspire young people to be positive and make a difference in their community or pursue their passion with dedication and integrity. In conclusion, I agree that it can be dangerous for young people to follow celebrities as role models, because they can have a bad influence on them. But it is important to mention that not all celebrities are bad role models. Young people should be able to evaluate critically the actions and values of their idols, and be exposed to a positive and balanced media. Parents, teachers and celebrities should therefore encourage young people to examine the behavior and values of their idols critically and encourage a positive and balanced emulation.
1359;Nowadays more and more people want to live by themselves, why is this happening?;Nowadays more and more people want to live by themselves. What are the reasons? Is it a positive or negative trend?These days a vast majority of people want to lead an independent life. The fundamental reason lies in people’s educational qualifications that fuel their craving for freedom in life. This can be seen as a positive trend because living alone is likely to nurture a mature mindset at early stages of one’s life.Many people are well educated to stand up on their own. Tertiary education broadens their horizons, and they wish to experience freedom of life. With a very good educational background it becomes easier to find a well-paid job, and with lucrative income they gain confidence to lead an independent life, thereby achieving their goals. For example, engineering graduates can find a job in another town and their salary is enough for them to move and settle down there. This enables them to move away from their family and live on their own.Living alone helps one to develop maturity, which can be seen as a positive impact on individuals and the society as a whole. Being independent means young people have to face life challenges alone and going through this process improves their resilience. They become more responsible, as they have to take care of themselves and develop budgeting skills and saving habits, for their future needs as well. Better planning of their finances nurtures the custom of wise spending at early stages of adult life.In conclusion, the reason why many people wish to live independently these days is because their education level gives them both the awareness of freedom in life and means of achieving it. Since living alone promotes one’s maturity, it seems to be a positive trend in today’s society.This response covers the task requirements by addressing the two parts of the question, why people choose to live alone and whether this is a positive trend. The ideas are clearly explained and supported, the information is organised in paragraphs in an easy to follow way, and the level of coherence is adequate. A range of complex sentence forms is used and there are no grammatical errors. Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.; This tendency can be explained mainly by a desire for independence and self-determination. In recent years, the tendency for people to live alone has increased a lot, and this tendency is seen in people of different ages and groups, which makes people curious to know the reason. One of the reasons for this shift is the change in family relations and social relationships. In recent years, due to the prevalence of the family, the family is shrinking and the number of people is decreasing, and many people live with relatives. People who live alone have more freedom to make decisions, more freedom to arrange their time, and more freedom to use space. But the most important reason is that as the economy develops and the living standard rises, more and more people can afford to live alone. Another reason is that because of the mobility and migration of people for higher education and career opportunities, family members and friends have become less close, so there are more and more people who live alone. Besides, the pursuit of personal development is also a reason why people like to live alone, because when people live alone, they have the freedom to think about themselves, their interests and their achievements without the influence and interference of others. This freedom, plus the plethora of housing in cities, makes it more convenient and attractive for people to live alone. In the end, the increasing tendency to live alone is a multi-faceted phenomenon, which is related to the desire for independence, the change in family and social structures, the development of economy and living standards, and the pursuit of personal development. It is also a trend that reflects the growing needs for freedom and autonomy. It gives people a deeper understanding of themselves, and it is also a change that gives people greater responsibilities and makes them stronger.

This essay will explain the reason why the people are spending more time;"popular hobbies rather than their individual activities.Hobbies and are different for everyone; this is the human nature,.

The essay needs to be easy to follow, and in addition your English should be accurate and appropriate."; a lot of time on these activities. But why they are spending more time on these activities? I think the answer is because of the influence of social media. On social media, there is a lot of competition among people to follow the latest trends and to show themselves. The daily flow of news in the network gives us an easy way to know new hobbies, food and events, which are tempting us to try them. Another reason for this is human desire for novelty and new experiences. As social media celebrities often promote the latest trends, there is a kind of illusion of urgency and even of an exclusive club about some activities. Therefore, people feel compelled to participate in them in order to feel a certain connection with these people and their community. It is very probable that, as technology progresses and social media evolves, the phenomenon will become more pronounced, influencing how people spend their time and how they relate to the world around them.
701;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. In this essay, the reason for wasting food and the acts which can be done by humans to reduce the amount of food one throws away will be thorougly discussed.Firstly, people waste food as one tends to be satisfied with the amount one eats. Thus, people order food more than one can eat as one can not estimate the amount of food. The amount of food one person can consume differs on one's conditions at that moment. The conditions include mood, physical features and activities one did on that particular day. Furthermore, one wants to taste all sorts of food, however, one can not eat all of those. Sometimes, people order food which are well decorated just to take a photo of it and upload it on social media such as Instagram. After taking photo, people just leave the food. The above mentioned reasons can be the causes of wastage of food.Apparently, people can reduce the amount of food they throw away. The restaurants can provide more informations about the amount and taste briefly to avoid the situation that consumers can not finish the food and are dissatisfied with the taste or smell. Moreover, consumers have to make a wise decision so that they do not waste both food and money. People should co-operate to reduce the wastage of food as it causes pollution on land. It leads to bad smell and brings insects to the areas.Conclusively, it is quite clear that people greatly waste food and there are a few ways for people to follow so as to reduce the amount of waste food.; In my opinion, people waste food for several reasons. Food waste has become an urgent issue in modern society. According to research, a large amount of food is wasted every year, causing both food loss and waste of natural resources. This is mainly due to the fact that there are many different foods in the stores and restaurants, so people have a lot to choose from and often overbuy, which leads to excessive food and thus waste, and the lack of meal planning and proper storage also leads to food wastage. In addition, people are more likely to regard food as a disposable item. There are many measures that can be taken to reduce the amount of food wasted. First of all, I would like to remind everyone that everyone should plan their meals in advance, and only buy what they need. The second is to encourage restaurants and shops to reduce the size of the dish and sell the food that is about to expire at a low price. Finally, the government should also organize public education on food safety and use-by and best-before dates. All in all, I think that everyone should be responsible for this problem, and people, businesses and governments should work together to make this problem less severe, and food conservation will also be promoted. It can also be used to extend the shelf life of food. With these measures, the amount of wasted food can be reduced to some extent, and it can also play a role in achieving a more sustainable food system.
1354;Nowadays people waste a lot of food, why is this happening and how to reduce waste?;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?At the time when famines heavily strike impoverished third world countries, many people living in wealthy countries waste tremendous amounts of food daily. In my opinion, understanding the probable reasons of this phenomenon is important and may lead us to some applicable solutions that will result in reducing food waste.The low cost of food seems to be one of the obvious reasons, exacerbating the problem. Due to the revolutionary technological achievements, people have increased both the quality and the quantity of their crops. In turn, according to the laws of supply and demand, the prices of the crops have immensely dropped. A recent study of the FAO stated that the global crops prices have dropped 50 per cent over the last decade. This enabled people to buy excessive amounts of food without a real need.Furthermore, the absence of strict regulations to discourage or punish this attitude can also be considered a major cause. Not everyone is aware that wasting food may create problems. Consequently, they are likely to resist any calls for controlling the consumption of dietary supplies unless they are forced by the power of law. Several countries in the world saw a drop in their national food waste after implementing a ban on the excessive purchasing of food.Fortunately, there are some possible approaches that can be adopted by both people and governments. Firstly, raising the awareness of this issue is immensely important. Using social media platforms can draw public attention to the potential dangers of food waste and how communities can confront it. Secondly, enforcing laws that prohibit the wasting of food by people and companies will deter such harmful practice.In conclusion, the decreased price of food as well as lack of regulations allowed the unfortunate trend of throwing away food to continue. I believe that creating awareness and legislation are parts of a straightforward solution to this issue.The writer explored the reasons for throwing away food and suggested some solutions, effortlessly conveying his/her ideas in this well-written IELTS essay. The information is presented in an orderly, logical and coherent way. A wide range of vocabulary is used in this written response. The sentence structures are varied and the vocabulary is impressive. Overall, this essay could achieve IELTS Band 8.;" There are many reasons why people waste a lot of food. The issue of food waste has become a major issue in today's society, as it is estimated that a large proportion of the world's food is wasted, which is not only economically unsustainable but also unfavorable to the environment. But one of the main reasons for food waste is that people do not plan the amount of food they buy and do not use what they buy. In addition, food products that are in date or have expired are often discarded before the expiration date. In addition, the trend towards pre-prepared and prepared food has led to a ""throwaway"" culture, where food is seen as a cheap commodity rather than as a resource. The second reason why people waste food is their cultural attitude towards food. In many societies, the food for parties and feasts is often prepared in excess, which then results in a lot of leftovers that are often discarded. The third reason is that people do not plan their purchases properly, so they buy too much food, which they then store incorrectly and then do not use. In order to reduce food waste, several measures must be taken. Awareness of food waste and a culture of sustainability must be promoted so that people will be more mindful and responsible in their consumption. It is also important that the government and industry play an important role in reducing food waste through their policies and practices, where surplus food is used to feed the needy. With these measures, food waste can be reduced significantly and a more sustainable food system can be achieved."
1351;Nowadays that many women have full time jobs, it is logical to share the housework evenly between men and women (agree/disagree);Nowadays in many countries women have full time jobs. Therefore, it is logical to share household tasks evenly between men and women. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Nowadays an ever-increasing number of women work full time, and in this reality it is widely believed that house chores should be shared between men and women equally. I strongly agree with this statement.One of the reasons for sharing housework between is to promote gender equality. A stereotype that has existed a long time is that females ought to stay home, taking care of the family once they got married. This includes looking after the children and doing all of the housework, which is fairly labour-intensive. However, this approach could have quite a few disadvantages. It would render women less able of keeping abreast of what is happening in the job market, thus forming a lifestyle where they might find it arduous to step into the society again. To avoid this, many women are willing to get back into the workforce soon after their maternity leave, and once they do, it makes sense that their husbands should share part of the household chores, to fulfill their family responsibilities.Nevertheless, we cannot be oblivious several drawbacks of this trend. One potential downside is that men are less experienced in dealing with household tasks. This is because many seldom take an active role in doing housework, according to customs of many countries. As a result, they may end up doing household tasks in a less than perfect way, which could contribute to some unnecessary quarrels between partners, hindering their family bond. However, the likelihood of this happening isn’t very high, because wives can offer some tips or guidance to their husbands when they learn how to share house chores such as mopping floors or doing laundry.To sum up, although some conflicts might be triggered when equally sharing the duties of household tasks, the benefits of this trend are relatively oblivious.The writer covered the task well by discussing the positives and negatives of sharing housework equally between men and women. Each paragraph has a clear purpose and assists with orderly presentation of ideas, making this essay easy to follow. The ideas are explained and substantiated, and the writer’s opinion is clear. The range of vocabulary is wide enough to avoid unnecessary repetition. Accuracy of expression could be improved (see corrections underlined in blue), but all in all this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.; The task is to write an essay about the above mentioned topic, using the headings of: 1. Gender equality in the home. With the increasing number of women entering the labor market, the old order of the division of household labor is no longer a valid concept. Women are no longer the only ones who take care of the house and look after the family, but are also contributing equally to the family income. If one of the partners is responsible for the majority of the housework, this can lead to stress and resentment. When both partners have a full-time job, both need their own time to relax and be able to pursue their own interests. So, not only is the division of labor fair, it is also necessary. By dividing the work equally between the partners, respect for each other and appreciation for what each is doing is increased. Moreover, by sharing the housework, both partners can experience a greater work-life balance, which in turn reduces the level of stress. Lastly, it is logical and necessary that housework is divided equally between men and women. This not only ensures equality, but also makes for a healthier work-life balance and a stronger, more supportive relationship between the partners. Finally, this is a step towards a more modern and harmonious society. By accepting this we can build a society where both men and women are able to work and live as they choose.
25;Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?;"It is a serious problem that there is an inadequate number of students who tend to select science as their major subject in universities in many countries. In my view, students may think that studying science has not a good career path. Also, this issue may deeply affect the international state of a country.The main reason why people do not think to study science is that they may see science as something unpractical, and potentially, they are hard to find a job when they graduate. Students are generally afraid that there is no employment opportunity after they graduate from university. Unlike engineering and business management, in which fields employers provide plenty of vocational positions for graduated students because there are lots of companies activating in these fields and universities may provide some practical training courses and internships. Students studying science have a relatively narrow way to walk, and may just be scientists. Moreover, although a successful scientist can get a massive bonus from some prizes, it is too hard to accomplish and is more likely to fail. Therefore, Students will avoid taking those risks and choose other subjects that are relatively stable and easy to find a job.This trend will eventually decrease the state of a country. Developing science can provide a strong and firm foundation for a country to establish a healthy and prosperous community. If there are not enough scientists, the whole scientific ability will decrease. Not only will the government pay extra money to other foreign countries to buy the required technology such as military equipment, but the public needs to spend more time and pay more effort to maintain the international standard production rate of a country. It is extremely dangerous that a nation easily suffers from a financial crisis and, finally, it influences the living standard of its citizens and causes damage to its financial systems.In summary, while science is regarded as a ""useless"" subject because of its narrow career path and low success rate, it is vital that the economic systems would be affected if a country develop without scientists."; The number of students who are willing to study science subjects has been a problem for many countries in recent years. One of the main reasons for this decline is the difficulty and competitiveness of science courses. Students who are not good at math are afraid to pursue this field of study. Another important factor is that students are not given sufficient career guidance. Many young people do not know that there are a variety of career opportunities in science fields, such as biotechnology, environmental science and data analysis. Lack of practical experience and insufficient school facilities can make students reluctant to study science. This trend has far-reaching and unfavorable consequences for society. A shortage of qualified scientists and engineers may lead to technological backwardness, medical failure and the inability to solve the growing problems of the environment. Instead, many students are choosing to study business or law, which seem to be more stable, but lack practical application. To resolve this problem, the government, the education system and industry should work together to provide career guidance, a more diverse curriculum and increased practical experience in science subjects. The result is a decline in research and development, brain drain and reduced competitiveness on the world market. In the long run, it is necessary to recognize the importance of science education and to work together to develop a more scientifically educated and inquiring society.
1361;Obesity is becoming common among children, give reasons and solutions (from Target Band ;"This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskObesity was once considered a disease of adults; however, it is becoming increasingly common among children. Why do you think this is happening? What can be done to help children stay healthy?Write at least 250 wordsFor many years obesity was perceived as a condition occurring only in adult life. However, in recent years the number of children suffering from obesity has grown significantly. There are several causes and numerous solutions which can be used to tackle this worrying phenomenon, and this essay will present a couple of them.While some reasons for childhood obesity are genetic, others include poor food choices exacerbated by easy availability of fast food, insufficient physical activity and a history of family members being overweight. Unlike the former, the latter factors can be changed, if the adults in the child’s life gain awareness and are willing to take action.To begin with, health is a complex matter which requires a balanced approach. In other words, there isn’t a single solution to maintain health, on the contrary, it is rather a mixture of multiple factors, such as and regular physical activity. For this reason, increasing the awareness of healthy habits among children is a responsibility of utmost importance. What is more, it can be easily achieved through the education system.On the other hand, children’s education might to stop the situation from worsening. Along with well designed health education schemes, we should also try to stop food companies from overusing sugar in products the young ones. It has been proven that more than 70% of the products available in an average supermarket contain dangerously high levels of white sugar. Sugar rich diet not only causes a significant weight gain, but also contributes to diseases, such as diabetes in young population.To summarize, emphasis put on the awareness of healthy living among children is invaluable. Furthermore, combining healthy habits with stopping food companies from in products which are easily children can be effectively implemented by the governments. Positive outcomes of such measures taken today will definitely have a long lasting effect on the future generations.This is a well developed response to the question. Relevant key points are included in the answer. Appropriate examples are also used to corroborate the writer’s point of view. Paragraphing is skillfully managed, information and ideas are logically sequenced. A wide range of vocabulary is used to allow certain flexibility and precision. Also, a variety of sentence structures is used. Accuracy of expression needs some attention (see corrections underlined in blue). Overall, the essay could achieve Band 8 in IELTS."; One). There are several reasons for the alarming rise in the number of children who are overweight. Firstly, children's sedentary lives, often in front of the screen, or playing video games, have greatly reduced the physical activity of children. Secondly, there is a lack of education and awareness of parents about the importance of a balanced diet and regular exercise for children. Parents are too busy and often resort to a quick meal, high in fat, salt and sugar, and do not realize the long-term harm to their children's health. The school cafeteria should provide healthy, balanced meals, with fewer snacks, and drink only water. There are several solutions to this growing problem. Firstly, the school must make physical education a compulsory subject. Secondly, the community must establish an exercise program for children, so that children can play and socialize. Finally, parents and guardians must be more responsible and limit screen time and provide healthy food at home. With the implementation of healthy habits and a healthy environment, children will have a healthier future. Therefore, the solution to childhood obesity should involve the school, parents and the community. Then we can significantly reduce the number of children with obesity and build a society that promotes healthy living.

In recent years, sugar-based drinks have become a serious problem for many people. Moreover, most people do not understand the dangers of excessive sugar consumption. There is no relationship between the use of sugar-based drinks and health problems such as obesity, diabetes and tooth decay. Sugar-based drinks are very easy to buy and advertised. They are also convenient and attractive. The solution to this problem is to educate people about the dangers of sugar-based drinks. At the same time, the busy life of modern people makes them drink fast drinks rather than healthy drinks. It is also the responsibility of the government to implement a tax on sugar-based drinks to make them less attractive to consumers. It is also important for schools and places of work to promote the habit of drinking healthy water and offer employees healthy drinks. The public should support companies that sell healthy drinks and encourage others to do the same. Those who want to reduce their sugar consumption should drink water, tea and coffee without sugar. On the whole, it is necessary to face this problem in order to avoid the health consequences in the long run and to achieve a more sustainable and healthy future.
1418;People attend college or university for many different reasons (for example, new experiences, career preparation, or to increase knowledge).;Why do you think people attend college or university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Many people after their high school years for several reason which they choose . I believe that the most common reason why people to have new experiences on life , to prepare for a career, and to increase their knowledge of their personality.Firstly, many people to have new experience in life. Many students leave their home and move to live when they go to university. This is the first time that they had to make a resolution on their own, without their parents’ help.

All of these prepare them for their career.Also, students attend university or college to increase their self-knowledge of their personality life. They attend increase their knowledge in subjects which they find interesting. For example, many students study science because they are in science but they work .To sum up, I think people should not only focus on a career when they go to university or college. They have to follow to have new experience and knowledge about their personality and the great world around them which they live in.; To some people, the main reason is the new experience, as college life offers a unique opportunity to break away from their daily life, meet new people and experience various activities. Attending college or university is a significant milestone in an individual's life, and people go there for a variety of reasons. Others choose to go to college or university to prepare for a career. In today's competitive job market, a college degree is a must for many jobs. Students can join a club, a sports team or a volunteer group to help the needy, develop new skills and friendships, and create unforgettable memories.

1253;People living in large cities have to face many problems in everyday life. What are those problems?Should the government encourage people to move to regional towns?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is not surprise to see that major cities are struggling with various issues which may associate with goverment and public issues as well.These issues are mild in some cities where as severe and vulnerable in few cities.Some of the common problems are increased crime rate,reduced safety,air pollution,noise pollution,flood,mechanical life and reduced greenery.The main cause for the above issues are increased population,uncontrolled carbon emission,poorly planned road and other public facilities such as underground drainage,contaminated water,roads and electricity.In general if the government take steps to control the above mentioned issues by implenting good law and orders which can improve public safety and happiness.Assist the sanitary boards with proper funding which may help to reduce water stagnant during rainy season.Funding for new research and developments may enhance to clear air and water pollution which can bring good health to the local residents.In contrast government may consider to develop the nearest towns with basic facilities such as modern housing,educational advancements,good roads,water and sanitary facilities. These facilities enhance the people to move to smaller town which may enhance to manage the key issues which are currently facing in the major cities.For instance Delhi,Capital of India seriously struggling with severe air pollution and lack of security which is heavily populated.Researches says that these problems can be reduced if the population rate is reduced.Meantime some group of people suggests that if the government may adopt new technology or structure which are following by any successful cities in the world.I personally feels that this also could be a better solution if it can be adopted by the government.By arguing the possitive and negative impacts it is difficult to conclude which option may works better to sove the issues.; If you want to move to another country, do you think it is better to live in the countryside? Living in a large city can be a very difficult experience. Firstly, the cost of living is very high. Not only is housing too expensive, but the cost of food, transport and other goods is also very expensive. Then, in a large city, people have to work very hard and keep up with the high speed and competition. There is also the problem of public services such as health and education. Due to the large population, there are long waiting lists for health services and large classes that are difficult for students. The government should encourage people to move to regional cities to ease the pressure on large cities and improve the quality of life. I think so. In countries like Australia, the government has set up policies to encourage people to move to smaller cities. This has led to the development of many small towns that have grown up and the population is distributed more evenly. For example, regional cities often have cheaper housing, less congestion, a cleaner environment and more personal attention from public services. So the government should adopt similar policies to make the city a more sustainable and pleasant place to live.
645;People often think about creating an ideal society, but most of the times fail in making this happen.What is your opinion about an ideal societyHow can we create an ideal society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"One of the ambition of the people is to create a harmonious community to live in. Unfortunately, individuals often fail to create one. This essay will discuss what is an ideal society, as well as ways on how to make it happen.An ideal community is a place where peace of mind over shadows fear. We all now that everyone wants a place that is criminal free. For example, people can just walk in an aisle without thinking of being raped or kidnapped. Moreover, it is a community in which discrimination, prejudice and racism is prohibited. In short, everyone is treated equally regardless of gender, colors, religions, social status, jobs and looks. It also means that, people can just walk in and out of a hospital or establishments without being looked down or degraded by other people especially those with high status.However, it is difficult for people to meet this kind of standards. This mainly because nobody is made perfect and as a human being we are mostly dominated by hatred, jealousy and selfishness. Although people fail to have a perfect society, there are some ways on how to have a near perfect place to live. First of all, government should make the lives of the people a better one by being an active role model to the citizens. There should not be corruption involve amongst the higher ups. Also, as what the saying goes ""learning should start at home"", it means that, parents should the take the initiative to educate their children proper manners in dealing with other people. In Japan, children were taught in a very young age on how to treat other people. That is why they always bow down their head as a sign of respect.To conclude, creating an essential environment can be challenging and demanding for all of us. Eventhough, it is impossible to make, each one of us can has the capacity to contribute to make society an almost perfect one."; The ideal society, in my opinion, is a society in which everyone has access to basic needs such as health care, education, and economic opportunities, and where people live in harmony with their environment and each other. In my opinion, to create an ideal society is a difficult but not impossible task. I think certain fundamental principles could guide us in reaching this goal. What one person considers ideal may not be the same for another. Firstly, everyone should have equal opportunity to a quality education. By ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to access quality education, we will ensure that we are producing individuals who are educated, responsible, and able to contribute to the community. Secondly, everyone should have equal opportunities to economic opportunities. So, for example, countries like Norway and Denmark have a more equitable distribution of wealth, and their citizens are generally happier and less anxious. A society where the gap between rich and poor is wide is more likely to experience unrest and a decline in opportunities for those less fortunate. Thirdly, governments and individuals should work together to ensure the sustainable use of our environment. This includes practices that reduce our carbon footprint, protect our natural resources, and protect our natural environment. It is an uphill battle and progress is slow, but with the right principles and commitment, we can get closer to achieving our vision of an ideal society. In conclusion, an ideal society must take into account many aspects, and education, equality of opportunity and sustainable development are fundamental.
1326;People should follow the local customs and traditions, when they come to live in a new country. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The globalised world these days makes it simpler than ever before for people to relocate and start building a life in a new country. As everyone comes from their own cultural background, a question arises of whether or not people should be expected to follow the customs of their host country. I completely agree with the view that while learning about the local customs may require some time and effort, it is valuable and will aid the integration of the newcomers into society.In many cultures following the local customs means showing respect, which is an important moral value in nearly every culture. The opposite is also true: disregarding traditions is often seen as a sign of disrespect. In order to establish good neighbourly relationships and feel welcome in the new place, it is important to demonstrate the effort to become part of the community. By expressing an interest in learning traditions, new arrivals gain a chance to interact with their neighbours and colleagues, get to know them and build some connections in the new country.Another positive aspect is the enhanced feeling of belonging that people get from participating in activities others around them are doing. When a national festival is in full swing, standing on the sidelines might make people feel excluded and perhaps even homesick, whereas joining others opens up opportunities to attend special events together, go to parties, meet new people and feel part of the celebrations. In Australia, for example, Easter is a very special time of the year and some of the traditional activities include Easter egg decoration and gifting, and baking hot cross buns; sharing your designs and recipes with others is an excellent conversation starter.In conclusion, learning the customs and traditions of one’s new country doesn’t mean a loss of their own culture. On the contrary, it is an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of cultural connections and should be embraced as a positive experience."; In my opinion, I largely agree with the view that people should follow local customs and traditions when they come to live in a new country. It is because accustoming to local customs and traditions is a prerequisite for a successful and harmonious integration into a new society. In some countries, for example, a person who enters a home without taking off his shoes is disrespectful and insulting. In such cases, it is very important to adopt the local customs and traditions, because it demonstrates the ability to adapt and respect the host country's culture, which helps to establish good relationships with the locals, not to be accidentally offended and a smooth transition into a new environment. One of the positive sides of the acclimatization process is that it is enriching for the newcomer and arouses his curiosity about the history, mentality and culture of the new country. This way, a person can get a deeper insight into the life of this country and gain a better understanding of its history, mentality and culture. In conclusion, I believe that people should try to follow local customs and traditions when they come to live in a new country. It is also important to note that it is impossible to renounce one's own customs and traditions completely, but it is possible to establish a balance between acclimatization and the preservation of one's own identity. I think that this is very important, because in this way not only is it possible to achieve a successful and harmonious transition to a new society, but it also contributes to the formation of a new personality, a new person with a new world view, a new understanding and respect for the diversity of world cultures.
1370;People should not work beyond the retirement age (agree/disagree);Some believe that people should not continue to work once they reach the age of retirement. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your experience.In recent years, with the improvement in healthcare sector and better , people are able to live longer and contribute to the economic progress of a nation more, compared to the past. Some see this as an entirely positive development, while others point out the drawbacks of working beyond the retirement age.Delaying retirement enables individuals to actively contribute to the society. On a personal level, working past retirement age provides an avenue for individuals to remain not only physically but also mentally active. Moreover, this option empowers the ageing population to be financially independent and economically self-sustainable past retirement age. In countries with growing ageing population such as Singapore, for instance, citizens are given an option to work beyond their retirement age based on the demands of their job and their capability to handle these tasks. Hence, working beyond retirement age empowers workers, ensures economic progression of the nation, and alleviates the challenges faced by an ageing population.On the flip side, working beyond the retirement age may result in adverse health impacts on workers and a decrease in productivity levels. In Japan, the suicide rates have recently been increasing due to rising stress levels at work faced by the ageing population who are pushed to work beyond their optimal capacity. Escalating stress levels from work to various health complications putting a strain on the healthcare system. Hence, working beyond retirement age may worsen the overall welfare of individuals and adversely impact the economy.To sum up, though working beyond retirement age health hazards leading to reduction in productivity levels, it seems to me that the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion, by assessing the capability of individuals and tailoring their jobs to their health profile, firms and companies should actively involve their workers to be productive beyond their retirement age.This essay is an excellent example of IELTS Band 8 writing. The author presents sound arguments making his/her point of view very clear, examples are being used to support the writer’s points and the organisation of information is handled very well. There are some minor inaccuracies, however, they wouldn’t affect the score much in the real test. Well done!; Writing an essay about this statement, you have to write at least 250 words, so the text should be at least 250 words long. I do not agree with the statement that people should not work beyond the retirement age. Firstly, people who work beyond retirement age can be in good health, both mentally and physically. Many people see their work as a source of purpose, and this purpose is difficult to replace after retirement. In addition, they can have a social life, which is important for emotional health. Above all, the cost of living is increasing and the average life expectancy is increasing, so people cannot afford to retire and they can work. Secondly, working beyond the retirement age can bring economic benefits. In addition, many retired people continue to work in institutions such as education, health and non-profit, which has a positive effect on the community. Finally, working beyond retirement age can also benefit the economy and society as a whole. To sum up, people should have the freedom to choose whether or not they will work after retirement. Working beyond retirement age can be beneficial for the mental and physical health, the stability of their economic life and the social development of the individual. The choice to work after retirement should be made on a personal and individual basis and not a fixed retirement age.
709;People think that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. Others believe that there are other alternative solutions for reducing crime.Discuss both views and give your opinion on this topic.;"Nowadays the sentences that judges give to criminals is always at the centre of attention of the society; some people think that the best way to reduce the amount of crime cases is to give longer prison sentences, while, others say that there are other alternative ways to stop it. This essay will talk about both views and, at the end, I will give my opinion about the argument.It is always more common to see long sentences for criminals, also if their crimes are not too bad to deserve that type of punishment; the reason why the court gives to them long sentences is because they think that staying a lot in prison will make the criminals understand that what they did is wrong and, next time, they will think twice before doing something bad or against the law.However long sentences can go against the human rights because they will take away from prisoners years of their life; for this reason, some people think that it can be better if, instead of stay close in a jail without doing nothing, they can be used in various works that will make them useful for the society and better person at the end of the sentence, like cleaning the city, helping old people in retirement homes and also cook for poor people.I think that there are other ways to stop crime instead of giving long punishments, also because everyone should have a second chance in their life and, more importantly, teach and show to prisoners different aspects of the community will help cities to become better places with less crimes to stop.This essay talked about two different types of views about crime sentences in our society, with my own opinion about the argument in the last part of it."; Some people argue that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences as a deterrent and punishment. This view is based on the belief that a severe punishment will deter criminals from committing crimes because of fear of the consequences. However, this is a complex and multifaceted issue, and there are several possible solutions. Others believe that there are other ways to reduce crime, such as rehabilitation and community service, as well as addressing the root causes of crime, such as poverty, unemployment, and social inequality. Advocates of this view also argue that longer prison sentences are more effective in restoring justice to victims and giving them a sense of satisfaction and revenge. However, I believe that a more effective solution to reducing crime is to rehabilitate criminals and reduce crime by addressing the root causes. In my opinion, we should try to prevent crime rather than simply punish it after the fact. In addition, not only is this a more humane approach, but it is also more cost-effective in the long run, as it can help reduce the number of repeat offenders and prevent new crimes from occurring. Therefore, I think that in the long run, alternative solutions are preferable in reducing crime.
1286;People today find their lives more and more dominated by their jobs. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is certainly true that many people around the world find their lives dominated by the work that they have to do. This is shown when you realise how people’s work, and how much time, effort and resources they devote to it, is often the subject of conversation.Most people depend on their jobs to generate an income to pay for their lives’ necessities and luxuries, and so work can naturally become a dominating focus. As this is an important part of nearly everyone’s everyday life, it can seem that people’s lives are indeed becoming more influenced by their jobs. Whether this emphasis on work is more significant now than in previous years is debatable. In many developed countries around the world, there are procedures in place to help people with finding work, providing unemployment benefits, ensuring education, and offering pension payments. In times past, these provisions were not in place and a job or business was required to provide the necessary income.Therefore, in spite of increases in the cost of living in many places around the world, it can be argued there is actually less pressure than in previous years to keep one’s job and perform well at it. This, in turn, would lead to people’s lives being less influenced by their jobs today. It is also true that in the past, people were as responsible and focused on doing well in their responsibilities as today and so, in this respect, the people of the past would be equally dedicated to their work as people are today.While I agree that people’s lives today are often dominated by their jobs, I feel that the current situation is not necessarily worse than before. In fact, it may be more positive, due to the fewer pressures to earn money in many countries.; I agree with the above statement to a considerable extent, because many individuals find themselves devoting a large amount of time and energy to their professional pursuits at the expense of their personal life. One of the main reasons for this phenomenon is the increasing demands of the workplace. Now, with the help of mobile phones and emails, the working day is being extended into the time that should be for personal activities. Often employees are required to remain constantly in contact with their workplace, which blurs the line between personal and professional life. This can have the effect of making work the dominant feature of an individual’s life and reducing his or her time for family, hobbies and interests. Another reason for the dominance of work in people’s lives is the pressure to maintain a certain standard of living. As living costs continue to rise, many people feel obliged to work long hours or take on second jobs in order to meet their expenses. On the other hand, some people do manage to maintain a healthy work-life balance and do not allow their jobs to take over their lives. They make a conscious effort to maintain a balance between work and personal life, and they allocate time for personal interests and pleasures. For example, a friend of mine works two jobs to support her family, and has no time for leisure or social activities. Yet another friend takes a morning off every week and enjoys a variety of activities, such as reading and going out with her friends. In conclusion, although many people do find that their lives are dominated by their work, it is possible to oppose this trend and maintain a more balanced and fulfilling life.
1264;Percentage of UK people who consumed daily recommended amount of fruit and vegetable in 2002, 2006 and 2010.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar graph compares the proportion of UK citizens in terms of their consumption of daily recommended portions of fruits and vegetables in three different years which are 2002, 2006, and 2010.Overall, females consumed the highest percentage of their recommended healthy food, followed by males, and last are the children.additionally the year 2006 had witnessed the vastest consumption of vegetables and fruits among all given years.Women ate exactly 25% of the daily adviced dose of natural food in the year 2002, 32% in 2006, and 26% in 2010, however men took 22% of the recommended dose in the year 2002, 26% in 2006, and 24% in 2010.On the other hand younger individuals only consumed 11%, 18%, and 16% of the daily requirements of veggies and fruits in the years 2002, 2006, and 2010 respectively. It appears that residents of the UK had eaten the highest daily requirements of greens and fruits in the year 2006 as compared to the years 2006 and 2010.; In the year of 2002, it was observed that 22% of men and 28% of women consumed the recommended daily amount of fruit and vegetables. In the year of 2006, the numbers slightly decreased to 19% of men and 23% of women. This decrease was a consistent trend in both the sexes and signified the worrying decrease in healthy eating habits among the UK population. By the year of 2010, the numbers decreased further to 17% for men and 22% for women. It is a matter of concern that fruit and vegetable consumption has been decreasing, as a diet rich in these foods is essential for good health and preventing chronic diseases. Comparing the numbers from the years, it is evident that the decrease was more pronounced in men, with a decrease of 4% between the years of 2002 and 2010, while the decrease for women was 6%. Nevertheless, the figures for the three years indicate that women were more likely to meet the recommended daily amount of fruit and vegetables, than men. Overall, the data suggests that the UK population requires more encouragement and support in order to meet the recommended daily amount of fruit and vegetables. These data highlight the need for targeted campaigns to promote healthy eating habits and to increase the consumption of fruit and vegetables, especially among men.
1402;Popular events like the football world cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The World Cup football and the Olympics are held worldwide with great national support and expectations. As a fan of those competitions, I agree with the idea that sporting events can be necessary for international relations and national unity, but only partially, because such events can have unintended effects on relationships between countries.First of all, the World Cup, Olympics and other international games work for easing tensions among different nations. For example, South and North Korea have football games regularly two nations a chance to understand each other . In the mid of North Korean supporters came to South Korea with the footballers and they were very excited during the sporting events. Even if it sounds ridiculous, many South Koreans were quite surprised at that moment when North Koreans shouted and cried during the match. We all realized that they were very normal sports fans even though they were occasionally very secretive. Through the sports, two divided nations could reduce their political and ideological tensions and could feel the patriotic unity.On the other hand, some sports matches can make international relations worse. For instance, football or baseball games between Korea and Japan are always big matches in two countries where . Sometimes, after the matches, the two rivals blame each other and their patriotic emotions explode in an aggressive way. scenario is that the troubles caused by losing games affect the players directly.; On the one hand, these events can indeed bring people together and provide a platform for countries to compete in a friendly manner and thus reduce tension and foster diplomacy. Although I agree that these occasions can have a positive impact on international relations, I also think that their role is often overestimated. On the other hand, it should be noted that the effect of these occasions on international tensions is often short-lived and superficial. For example, the Olympic games have a long history of promoting unity and peaceful coexistence between nations. The sport’s role in promoting world peace and unity is unquestionable, but it should also be acknowledged that sporting occasions, and particularly the fierce rivalry and nationalistic sentiment that sometimes dominates such occasions, can sometimes exacerbate rather than reduce tensions between nations. Indeed, these occasions do not always manage to prevent fan clashes, and the most serious tensions between nations do not always emerge during these sporting events. Nevertheless, it is fair to say that these occasions do indeed help to ease tensions and provide a safe outlet for patriotic emotions, but their role should not be overestimated and their limitations should be acknowledged.
913;Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:In the past, sporting champions used to be motivated primarily by the desire to win a match or to break world records. These days they are more likely to be motivated by prize money and the opportunity to be famous.What message does this send to young people and how does this attitude to sport affect the sports themselves?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;There were many sport competitions organized after the World-War II since the first Olympic games was held in Athena, in 1963, to bring the world together again. Previously, sport competition was seen as an opportunity for the athletes to break the world records for the pride of their home countries. However, nowadays, people are more inclined to win the match because of money reward and glory. I believe that young people should be more encouraged to achieve their goals to become a champion so that the value of sport competition would not be purely for commercial purpose.In the last decades, there have been a lot of sport competitions being held from national to global level. The athletes were trained by the supported teams to do their best to become the world champion. It was the pride of such athlete to win and see their national flags were rised after the match. Over the years, sport has become more commercial following its popularity to attract global audiences. Many athletes are paying more attention for the opportunity to win the match for commercial purpose. For example, one wants to become a famous soccer player so that they could become the ambassador of Adidas and get more income out of it.Due to the temptation for getting famous and having more money, there are people who choose to play unfairly during a competition. Instead of focusing on increasing their skills, they would cheat to win the game for money. For example, a soccer player may use thyroid injection for boosting their energy level even though it is strictly prohibited. Moreover, sport is not seen anymore to promote peace and solidarity among people from different cultural backgrounds but for the chance to get the superficial gloriness.To conclude, even if the motivation has shifted, the young people should learn to focus more on becoming a real champion and play fairly so that they can become the best athletes in thier expertise while the money and glory would follow them after.; In the past sporting champions were driven by a genuine passion for their sport, and the desire to win or break world records. Nowadays they are often driven by the lure of money and the opportunity to be famous. This emphasis on money and fame has a worrying influence on young people and on the sports themselves. Young people are likely to become more concerned with personal success than with the joy of competition and the desire to be the best. In addition, the emphasis on prize money and fame has an unhealthy influence on the sports themselves. The increasing commercialization of sport leads to homogenization of styles, a decrease in athletic merit and an increase in entertainment value. Young footballers who focus on obtaining lucrative sponsorship deals rather than developing their football skills are an example of this. The recent scandal concerning the buying and selling of votes for the Fifa Ballon d'Or award shows that the dangers of commercialization of sport have been exposed. Scripted reality programmes and inflammatory media coverage can also encourage the tendency towards the dramatic and the controversial at the expense of sporting achievement. A culture of sport needs to be developed which places athletic merit, fair play and teamwork above the lure of financial reward and celebrity.
903;Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:Some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by giving them extra money. This practice can act as an incentive for some but may also have a negative impact on others.To what extent is this style of management effective?Are there better ways of encouraging employees to work hard?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Running a company and controlling their staff is a big responsibility for employers . In general, employers should have a great vision about the future of their own company and how to improve it in a better way .To start with, some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by simply giving them more many. In addition, that practice can act as a good source of motivation, you can see that your hard work and your extra hours wasn't waste after all .On the other hand, this style of management may affect tha company and their community in a negative way . For example, the manager of the institution may be more focused on just one employee who's always have the extra credit for the work therefore the other employees work hard for nothing and that leave a bad idea that they clearly work for just having that extra money and rewards from the manager .Beside that, employees will be affected and their productivity will change and drop even more and all of that is a result on how the management of a company impact their work and their effort of doing more .To sum it up, all the members in that company worked so hard, a little credit for their effort and long hours of developing their company and rewards them for it won't do any harm . Not to mention, a manager can reward the staff of the institution by giving them a day or two off or basically a three hours break . Anything that make them really satisfied after their long and efficient work towards the developing of the company.; This kind of financial incentive can act as a powerful motivator for some people because it shows a tangible appreciation of their hard work and commitment. For example, a sales team that achieves its quarterly targets may be given a bonus, which in turn motivates its members to strive to exceed their targets in the future. It may also spur competition among the members of the team and create a sense of resentment and discontent among those who do not share in the rewards. But this style of management can also have a negative impact on others, perhaps causing resentment and demotivation among those who do not share in the rewards. The most effective way to encourage people to work hard is to combine financial rewards with other forms of recognition, such as opportunities for personal development, public recognition, and a healthy work-life balance. For example, companies such as Google offer its staff benefits such as flexible working hours, on-site child care, and opportunities for professional development, which can lead to a sense of belonging, motivation, and satisfaction with their work. Moreover, the over-emphasis on financial rewards can create a culture of competition and individualism that discourages teamwork and cooperation. In the end, a balanced and equitable management style is vital for ensuring that all members of staff feel motivated and rewarded, thus contributing to the company’s success. By taking a more integrated approach to staff motivation, employers can foster a more positive and productive work environment, where employees feel valued and supported, rather than simply financially rewarded.
897;Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime.Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In the UK and Australia, a jury is not provided with the defendant's previous criminal history. Some law representatives claim that this should be reverted, and the jury must be provided with this information beforehand. I fully agree with this statement since the jury will have a better understanding of the defendant's behaviour, and the final decision will be easier to understand for the audience.Having the jury the right access to the defendant's past criminal background, would provide the jury with enough information about the defendant's behaviour. This is because there are certain previous criminal behavioural patterns which allow a better profesional decision-making from the part of the jury. For example, a recent study of the Law's Practice of Melboune, has shown that around 77% of people who commit a crime, were involved in at least one criminal event in the past with similar characteristics to the current crime.On the other hand, if the jury has access to the defendant's past criminal history, it would be easier for the audience to understand the nature of the jury's final decision. This is because there have been cases in which the jury's final decision was not completely accepted by the audience or misunderstood. Therefore, providing the jury with enough criminal backgroud records of the defendant will make it clear to understand in beased of what or why the jury's final decision was made.In conclusion, in the UK and Australia, a jury does not have access to a defendant's previous criminal records, and some law representatives claim that this should be reverted. I fully agree with this statement since being provided with this documents will allow the jury a more understanding of the defendant's behaviour, and the final jury's decision will be easier to understand for the audience.;" In my opinion, lawyers have argued against the suggestion that juries should have access to all the past facts, and I also disagree with the proposal to change the existing laws. The main reason for excluding the past facts is to prevent the jury from being prejudiced. A juror who knows about the defendant's past crime could be inclined to think that the defendant is guilty and would be likely to believe the defendant is guilty, even though there is no evidence in the present case. This could result in an unfair conviction and damage the foundations of justice. If juries know about past crimes, it is likely that the jury will give more importance to the past crime, so there will be no consistency in the verdict. For example, a defendant who has been convicted of theft could be found guilty of theft even if the evidence is based on the circumstances of the crime. As a result, the principle of ""innocent until proven guilty"" is violated and the fairness of the justice system is damaged. This would result in confusion for the defendant and the victim. This will have a negative effect on the perception of the public of the fairness of the justice system. In conclusion, I believe that the current law on excluding the past facts is the most appropriate way to maintain the fairness of the justice system."
1308;Professional sportsmen and sportswomen and professional entertainers can often command enormous salaries today and this situation reflects society’s dependence on being entertained.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is no secret that today’s entertainment industry is extremely popular, with nearly everyone being engaged at some time in watching TV shows, movies and sports games. The North American sports industry alone generates a massive $67.7 billion every year. With the present emphasis on entertainment, sportsmen and women and professional entertainers can earn enormous salaries, with figures in the millions for one game, appearance or film. This situation certainly does reflect today’s society’s obsession with entertainment.Many people argue that celebrities do not deserve such payment when work in other professions considered of equal or higher value to society is underpaid. A-list celebrities can make over $20 million per movie, whilst many average workers can barely make ends meet. Of course there are lots of people who say that there are better ways the money could be used, rather than allowing such a vast amount to go to just one person. This is a fairly naive point of view, though. So long as people wish to watch entertainment, advertising in turn will be present and the most watched celebrities will be able to earn high salaries, as their presence will ensure the high viewing figures the advertisers desire.Though celebrities and sportsmen and sportswomen often make very large sums of money, it can also be seen as unfair to say that they do not deserve it or propose their money be used for something else. While it is true that they did not find a cure for cancer or made a life-changing scientific discovery, their hard work and expertise created a product that the public wants to see and the high payment merely reflects their value.In conclusion, it is clear that today’s society is indeed a society obsessed with being entertained and the high salaries paid to those who entertain society clearly reflect this. The high payments, however, are not necessarily out of place or undeserved.; In my opinion, I can not agree with this statement to a large extent. However, I would like to state that I agree to a large extent. Firstly, it is obvious that athletes and entertainers, especially in sports, can earn millions of dollars not only through their sports but also through the sale of products. For example, a soccer player like Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi, not only from the club but also from the sale of products, can earn millions of dollars a year. On the other hand, it is clear that professional sportsmen and entertainers have enormous salaries, which is an indication of the enormous profits made by the entertainment industry. The demand for entertainment is very high and the supply of outstanding talents is very limited, which is why salaries are inflated. This is because millions of people around the world are willing to pay to see them, whether they are on the field or on the screen. In the end, although I recognize that the entertainment industry is a major source of revenue and that exceptional talents deserve to be paid a high salary, I think the gap between the salaries of entertainers and other professions is worrying. For example, teachers, nurses and other essential employees earn much less, which leads us to question the value of these professions and the influence of celebrity culture on our idea of what success and success should be. Entertainment is clearly the main source of income for the world, but it is essential that we learn to re-evaluate the world and make sure that every profession is recognized and paid for their value.
1314;Public health is becoming an urgent issue nowadays. Some argue that governments should create nutrition and food choice laws to improve public health, while others believe that it is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Public health has become an increasingly pressing issue in the modern world, with many populations facing rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related diseases. This has led to a debate as to whether governments should establish nutrition and food choice laws for the betterment of public health or if it solely falls on individuals to make wise choices. In my view, everyone should take ownership of their diet and assume responsibility for their health because it is the right choice.The argument for government-imposed nutrition and food choice laws is that they could help prevent people from making unhealthy choices which could lead to more serious illnesses down the line. For example, government regulations could limit the amount of sugar or fats allowed in food products, especially those marketed to children, and impose taxes on unhealthy snacks like chips and candy bars. This approach would also benefit those who lack the knowledge about healthy food, necessary to make informed decisions. By providing clear guidelines on what foods are healthy, and by taxing the unhealthy options higher, the government would steer individuals away from unhealthy options.However, there are also some valid arguments against governmental intervention. These types of regulations infringe upon individuals’ right to choose what they put in their bodies. After all, everyone should be free to make lifestyle choices for themselves. Additionally, there may not be enough evidence to suggest that overly restrictive regulations would have beneficial effects on public health outcomes in the long run. Since people’s love of unhealthy food is often considered an addiction, it is unlikely that a higher price or other warnings would be enough to deter individuals from purchasing unhealthy food items.In conclusion, while there can certainly be benefits associated with implementing nutrition and food choice laws at a governmental level, ultimately it should still come down to personal choice and responsibility as far as one’s diet is concerned. Governments should instead focus on providing citizens with better nutrition education, so that they can make better informed decisions about what they consume. This way, they can receive the information they need while still having autonomy over their own diets and lifestyles.; Some people believe that governments should create regulations about nutrition and food choice in order to improve public health. They could, for example, restrict the sale of unhealthy foods or put a tax on sugary drinks and junk food. In their opinion, such laws would help reduce the number of people with diseases associated with unhealthy eating habits, such as obesity and diabetes. Those who support this opinion also argue that the responsibility for healthy eating lies with each individual and that governments should not restrict their freedom of choice, but, on the contrary, raise public awareness of the importance of healthy eating. They can also create an environment in which healthy food is encouraged by subsidizing the sale of fresh fruit and vegetables and by regulating the food industry to prevent unhealthy foods from being marketed too aggressively. In my opinion, while personal responsibility and choice are important, governments also have a role to play in promoting public health. The issue of public health is too complex for any one country to solve alone, and there must be a combined effort between governments, individuals and the food industry. A well-balanced approach, which combines education, regulation and raising awareness, will help improve public health without restricting individual freedom.
267;Reporting of crimes and other kinds of violent news on television and in newspapers can have adverse consquences. This kind of information should be restricted from being shown in the media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Reporting violent crimes and other violent issues could represents a adverse consequence sometimes. Overall, it is important to enphasyded that people are geting more and more violant and we can't blame only media as a mainly factor for those behavior.This kind of questions is almost a phylosical one and we will keeping this doubt for a long time, or even never now if people are becoming more agressive because they are more expousure to this kind of news, or if we are having more report regarding to violence just because people are getting more violent.I believe that people could feel estimulated to be a criminous person when they have a minimium certain that they won't be punish.For instance, stolen and other minimius crimes had increase at california region after they anounced that stolen under tham $1000 are consider a crime anymore. So the sensation that people could do anything wrong and that is no penalty for that, estimulates the number for stolen.In other hand, when we see some hardly rules the number of crime are dipest low, as we can see at Dubai, for instance. As all penalties are really hard and strongly implemented this place is considering highest safe.I bilieve that restricting any kind of information be showen in the media doesn't solve the problem, and, in fact, bring another new problem related to limited population information. When people know what are happening, type of crimes, etc, they could be prepare to handle with those problems and prevent theirselves.; On the one hand, the unrestrained coverage of violent news can have severe psychological consequences for the public, especially children and vulnerable people. Hence, the argument that such information should be restricted, which I partially disagree with. However, if the information is restricted, the media’s free speech and the public’s right to know are violated. The overexposure of graphic and disturbing content can cause fear, anxiety and desensitization to violence. Besides, excessive coverage of crimes creates a culture of voyeurism, which means that the public are interested in the sensational facts about the crime rather than the social background of it. By reporting crimes and violent events, the media can draw attention to a social problem such as rising crime rates, police brutality or lack of medical help. This leads to debate and advocacy and, ultimately, to social reforms. The media plays an important role in informing citizens about important issues and in holding the powerful to account. In the end, although I can see that violent news can have adverse consequences, I believe that total ban is not the answer. Instead, the media should report it in a responsible and balanced way, avoiding sensationalism and overly graphic coverage. It can also provide a platform for victims to be heard and for support services to be promoted. Ultimately, a balanced approach to reporting crimes and violent news is the best way to ensure that the public is both informed and not harmed. By doing this, the media can fulfill its duty to inform the public while causing the least harm, thereby creating a more informed and caring society.
1;Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Poverty represents a worldwide crisis. It is the ugliest epidemic in a region, which could infect countries in the most debilitating ways. To tackle this issue, rich countries need to help those in need and give a hand when possible. I agree that there are several ways of aiding poor countries other than financial aid, like providing countries in need with engineers, workers, and soldiers who would build infrastructure. Building universities, hospitals, and roadways. By having a solid infrastructure, poor countries would be able to monetise their profits and build a stronger and more profitable economy which would help them in the long term. Once unprivilged countries find their niche, the major hurdle would be passed and would definitely pave the way for much brighter future. However, I do disagree that financial aid does not solve poverty, it does if used properly and efficiently. The most determining factor if financial aid would be the way to go, is by identifying what type of poor countries' representative are dealing with. Some countries will have a responsible leader and some will not, with that being said, implementing a strategy, to distinguish responsible leaders from others, would tailor the type of aid rich countries could use. An example, A clear report and constant observation would be applied to track the progress and how this type of aid is being monetized. In summary, types of aid varies from country to another, and tailoring the type of aid is of paramount importance to solve this problem that had huge toll on poor countries.; If you want to discuss what is the most suitable form of help, you must first recognize that financial aid does not solve poverty. The notion that financial aid from developed countries to developing countries cannot solve poverty has raised debate about the most suitable form of help. Moreover, non-financial aid such as technology, skills, and education can have a more profound and lasting effect on a country's development. The skills and knowledge acquired through the training and skills development of local communities can make them less dependent on foreign assistance. It may be misused or wasted by corrupt governments, or it may lead to desperation instead of independence. But it can also help to build essentials such as schools, hospitals and roads, which are essential for a country's long-term development. However, financial assistance can be essential in emergencies and for certain development projects. Ultimately, a solution that works in all cases is not available, and a comprehensive and differentiated approach that includes a variety of forms of assistance is needed. In conclusion, although I agree that developed countries should give more help in the form of technology and skills development and not just financial assistance, I do not believe that financial assistance should be completely abolished.
1381;Schools should select students by their academic abilities, agree or disagree?;Some people think that schools should select students according to their academic abilities, while others believe that it is better to have students with different abilities studying together. Discuss both views and state your own opinion.Some people contend that mixed ability classes are more beneficial for children’s development than streaming them on the basis of judgement about their academic abilities. However, from my perspective, I disagree with this contention.Admittedly, mixed ability classes provide a better environment for children’s all-round development. In such classes, children with different abilities study together and in turn they can learn from one another. From example, a student, who is good at academic study but weak in dancing or painting, can learn how to dance or paint his peers. In this sense, mixed ability classes allow students to develop their abilities in different subjects instead of only academic abilities.Despite the argument above, I believe streaming students brings more benefits to teachers and students. As for teachers, separating children with better academic abilities from others facilitates effective teaching. This practice helps teachers to control their students more conveniently and easily. Compared with mixed ability in which teacher should consider students’ differences when they are using teaching methodologies, streaming makes this situation simpler. To be more specific, students are at the same level of academic ability in a class, and in turn teachers can use the same methodologies for them all. In this way, the narrower the spread of ability in the class, the more convenient the teaching can be.On top of this, enables students to learn in an effective way. According to students’ different abilities, they are taught in different ways that are more suitable for them. In the top streams, students use more difficult materials, therefore, they can learn more. In sharp contrast, teachers can explain the material more slowly to those in bottom streams. Under this circumstance, students with different academic abilities can study effectively and efficiently.In the final analysis, mixed ability classes are beneficial for students’ versatile development, but in my opinion, segregating students based on different academic ability is better for both teachers and students.The writer presented a balanced discussion of the topic, effortlessly delivered in a form of a fluent, well-written IELTS essay. The arguments and reasoning are laid out in a coherent, logical way. A wide range of vocabulary is used in this work. There are very few spelling errors that could have been caught in an additional round of proofreading (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). Keep up the good work! Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.; In my opinion, I do not agree that schools should select students by their academic abilities. The question of whether or not schools should select students by their academic abilities has long been debated. Some say that it can create a better learning environment, while others say it can cause psychological divisions between students. This system can also make students with poor academic abilities limited in their development and growth. If students are chosen by their academic abilities, they will be classified into different classes and their ability will be limited. Students from disadvantaged families may not have the same resources and opportunities, so they are at a disadvantage when it comes to academic ability. Moreover, choosing students by academic ability can also lead to social inequality. This will lead to unfair competition between students and unfair learning, and the outcome is that students are more likely to be successful in their academic work, and it is also possible to improve their comprehensive ability. Schools can achieve this by establishing a more inclusive and supportive learning environment, in which different academic abilities and individual needs are taken into account, through the implementation of equal opportunity and diversity policies, such as mixed-ability classrooms and individual learning plans. Regardless of the student's academic ability, schools should teach and guide them.
1337;Scientists believe that the world is in danger due to environmental changes. Some people say that personal lifestyle changes should be made to reduce the damage to environment, while others think that the government should do something to help. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Environmental problems are clearly something that is often discussed in today’s world. One part of the society claims that individuals should change their habits and lifestyle to improve the ecological situation. Others, on the other hand, believe that this issue should be solved on the governmental level. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and my perspective will be offered.It is hard to deny that human kind is responsible for the current environmental situation, and it seems impossible to achieve any noticeable result in this field without the participation of vast majority of individuals. For instance, a simple lifestyle change such as introducing the separation of household rubbish can make recycling projects more convenient and efficient. Moreover, consumers can reduce their usage of plastic items and, in turn, less plastic waste will contaminate the environment.However, many people still feel that the government has more tools to prevent environmental changes. One option that the authorities have is to discourage citizens from using personal vehicles by charging high taxes and additional fees. Moreover, politicians usually have access to resources to educate people about environmental problems and promote the most important ecological projects on all levels, ranging from special courses at schools to TV shows and websites related to this topic. Furthermore, it is a key responsibility of the government to protect the environment by spending state funds on research and modern equipment. Countries where legislation protects the ecology, for example Norway, have achieved visible results and overcame most environmental problems.In conclusion, I believe that a combined approach will work best to prevent or reverse environmental changes. A contribution of every individual is just as important as the intervention from the government in order to fix existing issues and save our planet for future generations.; This is a very important issue. Many scientists have argued that the world is in danger because of the damage caused to the environment. However, there is a heated discussion between people who believe personal changes are the answer and those who say government should intervene. On the one hand, some people believe that personal changes are the solution to all the problems of the environment. In fact, if many people do the same thing, they can make a big difference, and they can also lead others to follow them. On the other hand, others argue that governments should do something to prevent the environment from being destroyed. Governments have the power to establish a number of laws that can reduce the amount of waste and pollution much more effectively than individual efforts. For example, they can impose regulations on factories, and support the development of clean energy and other sustainable practices. In my opinion, both personal and government action are needed to prevent the destruction of the environment and protect the future of the planet. Personal changes are very important, but they are usually limited in scope and effect. The government, on the other hand, can establish laws and regulations that can help the environment on a national and international level.
1373;Senior managers should have higher salaries than other employees (agree/disagree);In many countries senior positions have higher salaries compared to those of young workers of the same company. Some people think this isn’t justified. Do you agree or disagree?While some believe that rewarding those in managerial positions with higher pay packets is appropriate, not everyone agrees with this view. Personally, I am leaning towards the latter position due to negative impacts caused by significant difference in salaries within a company.For one, executive officers should know that higher than sufficient salaries are not necessary. Indeed, the higher the remuneration they receive, the more likely the company to suffer from devoid of financial capability. Furthermore, they often gain powers that money can’t buy. For instance, they often make important decisions over how to make their company thrive. They are also entitled to allocate company’s budget and designate tasks to other workers. these non-financial entitlements, they should refrain from earning more than reasonable amounts as salaries.Unreasonably high salaries granted to the executives can also afflict other employees. In fact, it is foreseeable that many employees would feel powerless or even when they find out about the huge salary gap between the executive officers’ and theirs. Accordingly, some may leave the company, and others may go on to strike and demand a pay increase. However, those actions . Therefore, unfair salary systems like this would yield unhealthy working environment for both employers and employees.In conclusion, I oppose to those in managerial roles with obscene amounts of compensation because it can cost the company its prosperity and discourage other employees . Thus it is recommended for the company to decide on the salaries of executive officers and general workers by adopting a more motivating salary system.This is a good example of an IELTS Band 8 essay. The task statement is sufficiently discussed, and the writer’s arguments are relevant and well developed. There are only 2 body paragraphs, but they are coherent and help to organise the information. Linking words are used appropriately to sequence ideas. Skillful use of synonyms throughout the essay demonstrates the writer’s vocabulary. Some of the expressions used aren’t entirely suitable or accurate, but there aren’t many of them. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.0.; Senior managers, as a rule, have a lot of responsibility in an organization, such as making strategic decisions, managing departments, and increasing business growth. Such positions often require a high degree of skill, leadership, and the ability to resolve complex and difficult situations. So I agree that senior managers should have higher salaries than other employees. The decision of a senior manager directly affects the profit, growth and competitiveness of the organization. Their salaries should reflect the value they bring to the organization. Furthermore, senior managers often have advanced degrees and a lot of experience, which is expensive and time-consuming to obtain. The high salary they get is partly the reward for the time and money they have spent on their education and career development. Finally, higher salaries encourage senior managers to perform their best and make long-term decisions that benefit the organization. As for other employees, they learn from and rely on their senior colleagues, and as they move up the career ladder and take on more responsibility, their salaries should also increase. The salary structure in an organization also shows the different levels of responsibility and contribution of the different employees. This helps to recruit and retain top talent in senior positions, as the labor market for senior managers is highly competitive. In summary, given their responsibilities and the need to reward them for their skills and contribution, senior managers should have higher salaries than other employees. This is not only to motivate and reward them, but also to create a fair and equitable salary structure in the organization. It motivates employees to aim for senior positions and creates a sense of progression and progression within the organization.
1357;Should employers pay more attention to personal qualities rather than qualifications?;"While recruiting a new employee, the employer should pay more attention to their personal qualities, rather than qualifications and experience. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and include relevant examples.Recent decades have witnessed a burgeoning growth of numerous industries; therefore, recruiting the right person for the position is crucial to the development of enterprises. But how do we determine if a person is the best fit? Advocates of conventional recruitment methods opine that this candidate must have sufficient experience and qualifications needed for that job. Nevertheless, some people argue that candidates’ personal qualities cannot be ignored. In my view, both components are of equal importance.To begin with, the conventional approach of checking potential workers’ qualifications via their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, issued qualifications and certifications from authorised organisations is vital. Apparently, whenever we submit a job application, we are always required to attach a CV while a cover letter is optional. Without a decent qualification, even if that candidate’s personal characteristics are suitable, the enterprise will need to carry out lots of skill trainings eventually.On the other hand, occasionally during an interview some HR officers ignore the significance of assessing how candidates’ individual qualities can fit in the company. Employers should assess not only candidates’ qualifications but also their enabling skills, ethics and value propositions. The more an employee’s personal qualities fit in a company’s culture and values, the more he or she is motivated to contribute to that company’s vision. KPMG is a great example of evaluating candidates’ personal qualifications and skills by utilising a game-based assessment process, followed by a video interview. This methodology enables a comprehensive assessment, and is embraced by many companies nowadays.To summarise, employers should assess both personal characteristics and formal qualifications when recruiting people as each of these elements has its own vital contribution to make in talent-seeking enterprises.This response covers the topic well. The writer’s position is clearly expressed and supported by an example, the use of paragraphing makes this essay organised and easy to follow. Linking words are used appropriately. The use of complex sentences and advanced vocabulary is impressive. Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS."; Qualifications often show an employee's academic and technical abilities, but do not necessarily reflect the candidate's personality, work habits or ability to get along with others. This debate has been getting more and more attention in recent years. For example, a candidate with excellent qualifications may be ineffective in dealing with customers or communicating complicated ideas to co-workers, while a candidate with strong personal qualities, such as empathy, perseverance and positive thinking, can easily learn new things and adapt to the work environment, even if he has no certificate. In addition, paying more attention to personal qualities can also help companies achieve greater equality in the work force. In the end, although qualifications are important, the emphasis should be on personal qualities. The employer can recruit more people from non-academic backgrounds, so employees will have a different view of the world, a different way of thinking, which will make the company more tolerant, creative and flexible, and ultimately help the company become more competitive. So the employer needs to rethink its hiring strategy and place more emphasis on the personal qualities that make candidates stand out. The team not only has a solid foundation in terms of knowledge and skills, but also has the ability to adapt, work together and communicate, which is beneficial to both employees and employers.
1385;Should people spend a lot on weddings and birthday parties?;"Some people think that spending a lot on holding wedding parties, birthday parties and other celebrations is just a waste of money. Others, however, think that these are necessary for individuals and the society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Throwing parties can be expensive. While some people do not find these fancy gatherings worth what they cost, others believe such events are important to both individuals and the society.People choose to throw parties for a number of reasons. For starters, they can make better teams. Project kick-off parties are good opportunities to break the ice and help team members to know each other better. Celebrating a victory create a sense of success and belonging. Companies do not see parties as of money and allocate budget to support such events; moreover, they often leave good memories. From our own experiences, we all have happy memories of our birthday parties when we were little. Every family has great photos at family gatherings in their album. In addition, contrary to what some people believe that spending on parties is a waste of social resources, they actually create value, either by employing people in the party-planning business or by offering people better experiences.The popularity of parties, however, causes some tension in the society. They are hard on introverted people who find themselves uncomfortable in the crowd. This is a clinic symptom which psychologists call “social anxiety disorder”. There are other ways to celebrate important events that may have greater value for their cost. For instance, companies could send out gifts after successful projects and parents could take their children on family trips to celebrate birthdays.In my opinion, while a party is a form of social event that brings many benefits to individuals and the society, other choices should also be considered, either to cut spending or to relieve the stress of those who are not fond of crowded celebrations.This is a very good essay. Other than minor inaccuracies there are no problems (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). Seems to be worth IELTS Band 8."; For some people, these special occasions are once in a lifetime and should be celebrated in a grand manner. On the other hand, there are those who believe that it is pointless to spend a lot of money on these celebrations, which can make a lot of guests and the birthday girl or boy happy. In many cultures, spending a lot on weddings and birthday parties is a sign of a high social position, and the demand for it is also very high. Besides, it can also be a sign of love, respect and gratitude for the person being honored. The need to spend a lot on weddings and birthday parties, however, often leads to financial difficulties and debts, which in turn have a negative impact on the family and on the next generation. Besides, the money spent on weddings and birthday parties could be used for more useful things, such as saving, paying off debts or giving away to charities. Perhaps it would be more reasonable to celebrate weddings and birthday parties in a way that is meaningful and enjoyable, but also sustainable and responsible. For example, a reasonable budget can be made, the priority is the most important thing, the pleasure and love of the celebration is more important than the cost.
1393;Should the same laws which prohibit the sale and consumption of heroin be applied to tobacco? Discuss.;Recently, a heated debate when a few reputable health organizations suggested the application of a similar act of heroin selling and usage prohibition . In this , I will analyze why the adoption of such a law could be a breakthrough in our youngsters’ safety, according to my vision.Firstly, tobacco does not differ much from heroin when it comes to the addictive effect. , the active ingredient in tobacco, exerts its effect by acting directly on smoker’s brain cells. Numerous experiments carried out by on animals, rats, proved that this toxic chemical does lead time to dependency, similarly to the effect experienced with .Secondly, the restriction on selling would surely show an instant decline in tobacco smoking. ” Having easy access to cigarettes puts a tremendous pressure, especially on teenagers,to resist such a temptation” Dr.Hisham , head of department at Alexandria Medical college , states firmly. “Giving the new generation the sense that the severity of smoking is to other lethal drugs usage be a life saving step, they will thank us for as they get older.” he continues.To recapitulate, applying of a futuristic law such as the suggested one will have a positive impact ,not only on young people’s health but on our society as a whole.; It is a complex and controversial issue that, on the one hand, both heroin and tobacco are substances that have a significant effect on the health of their users. Especially the tobacco industry is responsible for millions of deaths every year, especially smoking-related illnesses such as lung cancer and heart disease. And on the other hand, there are considerable differences between the two substances, which make a direct comparison difficult. Heroin is a prohibited drug with no recognized medical purpose, with a high potential for abuse and social problems. With this in mind, one could argue that in order to protect public health, tobacco should also be subject to the same harsh laws that apply to heroin. Nevertheless, applying the same laws to tobacco would lead to a radical change in a society's attitude to tobacco, and in some cases the reprehensible, although unhealthy, practice. On the other hand, tobacco, although highly addictive and unhealthy, has been an officially legal substance for centuries, with a large industry based on its use. Accordingly, although tobacco poses a significant health risk and should be subject to strict regulations, it may not be the most effective or practical way to directly apply the laws that apply to heroin to it. A more subtle policy of strict regulation, public education and cessation support would be more appropriate and better suited to balancing public health needs with the realities of the tobacco industry and the consequences of overcriminalization. Moreover, this would lead to an increase in criminality, the sale of a less safe product and the reduction of regulation and taxation, which is currently used to support public health efforts.
1394;Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth with poorer nations by providing them with things such as food and education? Or is this the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens?;I think that wealthy nations should be required to share their wealth with poorer nations. at providing such things as food and education because of the three following reasons.Firstly, citizens of both wealthy nations and poorer nations are human beings. Therefore, we can not look at, hear of, or talk about people who lack food, education, without compassion and sympathy. Sharing wealth with poorer nations is not only a good deed but is also a .Secondly, many nations in Africa and Asia are poor. Famine, diseases, crime and illiteracy are killing the citizens of these countries. , many nations in Europe and America are rich. If there are no actions taken, this inequality will increase dramatically. Poor countries will become poorer while rich countries will become richer. As a result, the poorest countries will become slaves of the richest countries. So, sharing wealth is useful way to prevent people from that bad future.Thirdly, although sharing wealth with poorer nations is very necessarythis help should only stop at providing such things as food, medicine and education. Or else, poor nations may become dependent on the aid. They may lose enthusiasm to build their countries by themselves. Moreover, rich nations can take advantage of sharing wealth to interfere with the governance of poor nations’. This can’t be considered a humane action and should be prevented.In my opinion, sharing wealth with poorer nations has both a bad side and a good side. What we have to do is its bad side and its good side.; In this essay, I will argue that there is a moral obligation on the part of wealthy nations to help poorer nations as they have a greater capacity to help. Providing food and education to people in need will help to reduce poverty and increase life expectancy, thereby contributing to global stability and prosperity. This is an old question that has always been debated. But some say it is the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens, as they are the best placed to know what is needed and how to go about it. As a result, wealthy nations have a moral obligation to support humanitarian and development projects in poorer countries. However, the most effective solution is one that is balanced between these two positions. Moreover, external assistance often hinders the process of development, due to corruption, bureaucratic inefficiency and a lack of proper transport links. Ultimately, the most sustainable and equitable outcome is likely to be achieved when governments of poorer nations are empowered to help themselves, with the help of wealthy nations. The latter can provide poorer countries with assistance in the form of capacity building, technology transfer and policy advice, enabling them to develop their own capabilities and resources. In this way, the autonomy and self-determination of poorer nations are respected, while they receive the assistance they need to deal with the problems that they face. This approach will reduce poverty and inequality, and will ensure that all people can live in a more equitable and prosperous world.
1302;Social media has become a real problem for some young people today, and governments should create laws that allow only people over 18 years of age to have accounts.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Social media today is extremely significant to a majority of the population, especially the younger generation. Many teenagers find it exceptionally convenient and necessary for communication and entertainment. However, not everyone is able to use social media responsibly, which gave rise to the idea of making it accessible to only those older than eighteen years of age.Though there are negatives, such as cyber-bullying, or being too distracted by these modern media, there are issues surrounding most things in life. It is a choice to go onto a social media website, and many younger people are capable of managing accounts without any difficulties. It is not the government’s responsibility to monitor under eighteen-year olds; that is for the parents.Statistics show that over eighty per cent of teens use a form of online social media. It allows them to chat online, easily stay in contact with friends and family across the world, and see updates on others’ lives (through text, photos or videos). Social media is a way to express thoughts or ideas and to stay in contact with the rest of the world.To not permit one of the largest Internet-using demographics to use social media because a few people have problems with it is an irrational and an unfair restriction. Not only would profit be lost with fewer users, but controlling who creates accounts and monitoring proof of age would be difficult as well. I believe that laws should not make social media inaccessible to young people under eighteen; this would be unnecessary and absurd."; The above statement is about a law that only adults over 18 years of age can have accounts. While I can see the idea, I am partly against it. The issue that social media is becoming a real problem for some young people today needs to be addressed. This can be seen in a study by the Royal Society for Public Health, which shows that social media use is associated with higher levels of loneliness, sadness and anxiety in young people. If the government decides to implement age restrictions, these issues can be resolved. On the other hand, the effect of social media on minors can be detrimental, such as cyberbullying, reduced attention span and exposure to inappropriate content. For example, if the law were to be implemented, it would be difficult to monitor, because young people could easily circumvent the law by providing false data or by using their parents' accounts. On the other hand, I believe that the general prohibition of social media for minors is not a feasible or viable solution. On the one hand, young people often use social media for positive purposes, such as communicating with their friends, accessing educational resources and participating in creative communities that support self-expression and creativity. Also, parents and teachers should teach children to behave in a socially responsible way when they are on the web. Instead of introducing age restrictions, I propose that governments and social media companies should work together to create a safe environment for young people, introducing age verification tools and improving data security features, and promoting digital literacy among young people. If these measures are taken in a multifaceted way, they can minimize the negative impact of social media on young people without the need for excessive regulation.
771;Society is based on rules and laws. If individuals were free to do whatever they want to do, it could not function. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?;It is commonly held that society can operate perfectly by a set of rules. It means that providing total freedom to people undoubtedly results in chaos with the further possibility of total collapse. I strongly agree with this point of view as I am in the opinion that rules play a significant role in creating a stable society. In this essay, this idea will be discussed in detail.Basically, a set of rules can be helpful to achieve productive results in such essential areas as medicine and construction. For example, it is necessary to develop common procedures of operations in surgery or traffic rules for public transport. Unless there are not standardized, it might cause a lot of deaths or at least injuries. Constructing also should be based on common processes because comfort and safe accommodation is a necessity for many people. Although there are people who consider rules and laws limiting and imposing, it can be argued that they are critical in the organization of humanity.Laws are not obstacles on the way to people's freedom because they are established to regulate formal relationships when it is difficult to find a compromise informally. Moreover, they are vitally important when people face crime and violence. Without any system of justice solving crimes becomes more challenging. All criminal accidents tend to be out of control and spread around the world immediately. Shoplifting, robbery, and even disastrous wars can plunge our world into darkness. This way humanity might face total chaos where morals values and behavioral patterns are neglected. In this context, the word ‘society’ risks becoming totally meaningless, as its main definition is a 'group of people with common traditions and rules.'From the arguments presented above, one may conclude that any society needs standards, laws, or even moral principles. They form a foundation for safety, a good level of medicine, and science that allows to create a strong society and manage any difficulties or threats that may disturb people’s well-being.; For me, although I agree that rules and laws are necessary for social order, I disagree with the idea that individuals should not be free to choose. It is a commonly debated topic that a society cannot function if there are no rules and laws and that people are free to choose what they want. Individual freedom, on the other hand, is necessary for personal development, creativity and innovation. For example, laws against theft and violence protect the safety and property of citizens, and therefore allow citizens to live in a safe and secure environment. Furthermore, individual freedom allows people to express themselves and follow their passions, which in turn will enrich the diversity of society. In addition, if individuals were not free to choose, societies would not be able to evolve and develop, because it is the history of people who have questioned and challenged existing rules and laws that have made great achievements and discoveries. In short, a balance between individual freedom and the security and stability of rules and laws is necessary. The most sustainable and prosperous society is the one that respects and values individual freedom and social responsibility.
1352;Some believe the government should take care of retirees, while others think everyone should save for their own retirement (opinion);Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.It is true that when people advance into their golden years, they require more help and attention. For that reason, a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly. However, I tend to agree with those who argue that workers should be saving a portion of their income to have a nest egg in their retirement.To begin with, a culture of saving rather than depending on the government may foster the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government. As a result, the government would be able to release more funds to more productive purposes, such as development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which may expedite the overall progression of a country.In addition to economic factors, putting money aside has some personal benefits. Since savings-oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses, this may instill a sense of self-respect and pride in them. On the other hand, those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma, as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society. Hence, to live a life with dignity and pride, taking responsibility for funding one’s own retirement is evidently a better option from individual perspective.In contrast, the provision of monetary outlays for retirees has proven unfeasible in many countries. Since in many nations the number of senior citizens is on the rise, in the long run governments are likely to struggle to sustain the cost of providing for the elderly. The early signs of this have been seen in many countries that were forced to raise the retirement age, including my home country where men can now retire at the age of 67 instead of 65. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, these kinds of support may become completely unsustainable.In conclusion, the provision of state monetary support may undoubtedly lessen the concern of retirees to some extent. However, considering the issue of sustainability of this provision, it is better to opt for individual savings from the very beginning of working life, for the benefit of both individual and national development.This response addresses all parts of the topic, by discussing the merits of funding one’s own retirement versus relying on government pension. The writer’s opinion has been stated as well and is very clear. The neat presentation of ideas has been helped by appropriate paragraphing, and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay. The author’s vocabulary seems to be rich and there is a variety of sentence structures used in this essay. Overall, this essay deserves an IELTS Band 8.; The first group of people say it's a basic human right and the government has a moral obligation to care for the elderly. On the other hand, the advocates of governmental responsibility for retirees say it's a basic human right, and the state has a moral obligation to care for the elderly. I personally think that the second group is more practical and sustainable in the long run. It will increase people's awareness of the importance of saving for their own retirement. On the other hand, it will cause an increased financial burden on the state and a reduction in the quality of the service provided by the state. In short, although it seems that the state provides retirees, it is better for each person to make a detailed retirement plan to avoid the resulting increase in the state's responsibility. At the same time, it can help each individual make a detailed plan for their own retirement, and make pension or other savings plans to achieve a degree of security without relying on the state. In addition, the second group is more conducive to the independence and self-reliance of the elderly, so they can enjoy their retirement life without financial difficulties. With a stable and dignified environment for the elderly, the culture of saving and taking responsibility can also be passed on to the public, so as to realize the vision of social harmony.
1398;Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree that this is the right course of action? Give reasons for your opinion.;, organization and companies as well as governments impose restrictions in work places and public amenities. It has become fashionable in the world today . I feel that smoking can be harmful, but I don’t think it should be forbidden completely. I would also argue that people should have the whether or not they should smoke.Allow me to present the three positive sides of smoking. Firstly, smoking certainly helps many people to relax. For some, it even improves concentration. If someone is upset or they have , to smoke to reduce the pressure or tension. people like to smoke when they are relaxing with friends. Secondly, governments throughout the world make huge profits from taxes on cigarettes. The income obtained through taxes provides funds which are used for building and public places such as parks, gardens, sports ground and foot paths. Thirdly, tobacco industry also employs tens of thousands of people all over the world, particularly in poorer countries such as Zimbabwe or the Philippines. Without cigarettes, these people would have no jobs.Despite these positive are lots of negative effects to smoking too. Initially, smoking has been proven to be very dangerous for health. cigarette contains more than 4000 chemical substances, therefore, it dangerous diseases such as heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis or lung cancer. According to a recent report in Britain close to 3,500 people are killed each year in road accidents and 120,000 are killed by smoking. Furthermore, smoking costs governments millions of dollars because of the large number of people who need treatment in hospitals for smoking-related problems. Moreover, passive smoking is also a major concern today. Recent research shows that non-smokers can suffer from health problems if they spend long periods of time among people who do smoke. In the UK children whose parents are are three times as likely to start smoking themselves .In short, I think the world would be a better place without cigarettes. However, the decision of whether smoke or not to smoke should be for each individual to make. I suggest that people should not smoke in a room or a place where there are non smokers, however they should be free to smoke elsewhere.; In my opinion, banning smoking in offices and public places is the right course of action. First, banning smoking protects non-smokers from the dangers of second-hand smoke. Secondly, banning smoking will reduce the number of smokers. A great number of studies have shown that second-hand smoke can cause serious health problems, including lung cancer and heart disease. By banning smoking in offices and public places, governments and businesses can reduce the risk of these problems and provide a healthier environment for everyone. Moreover, banning smoking in public places reduces the cost of treating smoking-related diseases. If smoking is allowed in public places, young people are more likely to start smoking themselves. By restricting smoking to private areas, governments can de-normalize smoking and make people more likely to stop. In conclusion, I strongly believe that banning smoking in offices and public places is the right course of action. The benefits of banning smoking, including the reduction of the number of smokers and the reduction of the costs of smoking-related diseases, are much greater than any disadvantages. The World Health Organization estimates that smoking causes millions of deaths every year, and the cost of treating smoking-related diseases is astronomical. So I think governments and businesses should continue to ban smoking and provide a healthy and sustainable environment for everyone.
665;Some cities create housing areas by providing taller buildings. Others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. What solution is better?;Some big cities, especially in Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama in Japan tend to build taller buildings like skyscrapers. Other local cities and places where are scarcely populated are built wider. This is quite understandable in terms of space, and there might be some solutions to dissipate populations around Japan.Initially, the main reason why people tend to gather in big cities is that there are many opportunities to get a job. There are famous headquarter companies and branches that are based in foreign countries. Therefore, more and more people move to the big cities so that many taller apartments and buildings are built to let them live in the limited space. There seems to be stressful due to people being densely populated, but infrastructures are well organized, especially transport, medical care, and security.In contrast, the population in the countryside becomes less. Therefore, there is plenty of space to build houses in the wider area. It seems to be well-relaxed and comfortable to live in a slow-paced lifestyle. But, it is apparently more difficult to obtain a new job, and lacking transport, so they need to rely on cars. In addition, the number of hospitals is much smaller than big cities. These issues are long controversial as a first world problem.Finally, as Covid-19 spread worldwide, many people are started to work at home with a lap top computer. Innumerable companies adopted IT systems that are able to work remotely. In addition, some companies had already stated this systemized working style will not change, however, Covid-19 completely ended. This means that many people do not necessarily need to live in big cities. Therefore, if the transport system is well organized, especially establishing and improving a train, which works faster and more frequently. This effort will be not only helpful to dissipate the population outside of the big cities, but also promotive to tackling with great infrastructures to countrysides.In conclusion, as a result, the densely populated cities will be able to reduce its population and increase the population in the countryside. As a result, some issues will be resolved and become well-balanced solutions. Finally, it might be able to build wider houses in big cities with reasonable prices than now.; The advantages and disadvantages of both solutions depend on many factors such as the city's geography, population density and life quality. There has long been a debate about the best way to create a city's housing areas. This solution is particularly suitable for cities that have less access to land, such as coastal, coastal and mountainous areas. Building houses on the land that already exists is also very favorable, as it increases the amount of houses and reduces the size of the area needed. On the other hand, it is possible to build houses over a wider area of land, also known as low-density or suburban development. This solution also offers more efficient use of resources, less traffic and greater cohesion among residents. On the other hand, this solution also increases costs, reduces natural light and ventilation and increases the cost of upkeep. It also requires more land, which increases costs for the environment, increases the need for transport and can lead to the expansion of cities. This solution allows more space for the inhabitants, greater privacy and more contact with nature, which is why this solution is often chosen by families with children or those who seek a quieter life. The best solution is probably a balanced solution that combines both high and low density. Building taller buildings in the center and keeping green spaces makes the city more sustainable, efficient and comfortable for the residents. The best solution is to depend on the particular needs and limitations of each city. The main thing is that the city planners consider the city's special features and choose a mixed and flexible development strategy to create prosperous, livable and sustainable residential areas.
11;Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Athletes to be on the top need to have high-end facilities that a country can provide for them to be able to improve their strengths and skills. Some government opted to build facilities exclusively for training athletes for international sports goals, instead of building establishments for everyone to have the liberty of using the sports facilities. From my perspective, this phenomena is a negative development.Being able to discover an individual's potential, they need to have a support from any form of sources. Establishing sports facilities can help people to discover their own interests, talents and even skills in learning new things. Centers which offer utilities, equipments and state-of-the-art tools that provide learning sports can be a great advantage to people who want to train themselves on the things that can awaken their interests when it comes to sports.In addition, building these kind of establishments, not only for the purpose to train top athletes, but also for people to immerse themselves to different variaties of activities can help them socialize more with their peers. This is extremely beneficial that aside from doing sports that they are into, they get to play along with peers, discover one's potential and also learning from one another. Furthermore, these individuals can also have the future to be one of top athletes that a country can have.In conclusion, although there are countries that chose to have their sports establishments exclusively for training top athletes, I assert that these that actions can be lead to negative feedbacks. Government should allow everyone the privilege to use and avail facilities that can hone an individual's talents, skills and dexterity when it comes to sports and this can also be immensely benefical for both country and citizen alike.; This approach has some obvious advantages. By constructing world-class facilities, top athletes can get better training, which in turn can lead to better results and more medals at international competitions. On the other hand, there are also disadvantages. For example, countries like China and the United States have benefited from this policy, and have developed world-class athletes by providing athletes with world-class facilities and training programs. This in turn can increase national pride and attract foreign investment. However, this policy can also create a kind of elitism, and only a small part of the people have access to high-quality sports facilities, while the rest are disadvantaged. By focusing on elite athletes, the average citizen may not be given enough support, and the general public may not have access to sports facilities. This can lead to the deterioration of society and the abolition of the most talented athletes from disadvantaged backgrounds. In my opinion, this is a negative development. And the country should combine the construction of high-quality sports facilities for elite athletes and those for the general public. This can have many benefits, such as reducing health costs, improving mental health and increasing work efficiency. It can also create a more sustainable and equitable sports system.
725;Some educationalists say that every child should be taught how to play a musical instrument. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;It is commonly known that music has always played an important role in upbringing of children and a lot of parents wish their kids play a musical instrument. However, I disagree that this skill is essential to every pupil.First of all, not all people are born with a talent for music, which is essential if one wants to learn how to play it. Some people are natural musicians and succeed in this sphere with ease. On the other hand, there are children for whom learning to play is a hard work and, eventually, they might start hating music instead of enjoying it. Some people are bound to become excellent engineers or doctors and for them learning to read and play music is just a waste of time.Another important factor is that all kids are different and for that reason each of them desires to have a different hobby. If all pupils spent time on music, those who are not interested in it would have less time on things that are really exciting for them. Undoubtedly, everybody has a right to spend their free time in the way they want.What is more, playing a musical instrument is not considered to be an essential skill for a successful career. More time should be devoted to more important subjects, such as Math, Science and Languages. These have more chance to be useful for people when they grow up and graduate from school.To sum up, teaching all children to play an instrument wouldn't be a good idea. It should be taught only to those who really want it as not only would it ditract a child from subjects and hobbies which are more important in their opinion, but also it cannot be mastered by everybody.; On the one hand, the knowledge of music instruments can bring many benefits to children. In the development of children, some believe that this is indispensable. I partially agree with this statement. It can enhance the development of intelligence, improve memory and spatial reasoning, and develop discipline, creativity and self-expression. In addition, it can even improve the language ability and mathematical ability of children. On the other hand, I don't think that every child should learn to play musical instruments. The reason is that not all children have the same ability and interest in music. If they force them to do so, they will be dissatisfied and will not like music. In my opinion, the teaching of musical instruments in schools is a voluntary activity, and the children who are willing to learn can learn and benefit from it. In addition, there are other compulsory subjects, such as reading, writing and math, that need to be paid more attention to. In my opinion, the most appropriate way to develop music education is to combine the individual needs and interests of children.
73;Some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The thought of some experts, is that people from rich countries are not satisfied by an ipotetical increase in their economy. In this essay I will discuss this point of view and I will explain why I am not sure I agree with that.It is generally believed by some professional figures, that additionals rise in economic wealth are not so crucial for a rich coutry. People from countries sush as Japan, the U.S.A, Switzerland or Cina are aware of their wide economic power and these governments offer a lot of benefits for their citizens. Thus, people have yet what they want, such as fundings for projects, well-organized cities, a lot of job opportunities. In fact, they do not fell a significant sense of satisfaction in the increase of their economy.Made this point, it is also true that some surveys used by The Italian University of Parma, reveal that citizens from coutries which a strong economy, are really grateful and satisfied by any additional rise, in the economic sector. As consequence due to this increase, they can ask more fundings for some start up or to improve the technology equipment in schools. Personally, I tend to think as a matter of fact that this is the right view. Because it is logical that more money mean more opportunities in any sector of the country. Hospitals, schools, museum and even historical buildings can have the possibility to obteind a lot of benefits.To conclude, in this essay I discuss the generel view of some experts about people from rich countries. I also explained why I strongly disagree with them.; I partly agree with this opinion. This question of the relationship between the wealth of the country and the happiness of its inhabitants has been argued by experts for a long time. For example, it was found that in the countries with a high GDP per capita, the increase in the GDP did not lead to an increase in the satisfaction of citizens in the same proportion. This means that the wealth of the country has an effect on the satisfaction of its inhabitants only to a certain extent. That is, the satisfaction of basic needs, that is, food, housing, health care, is achieved, but then additional wealth does not contribute much to the satisfaction of these needs. On the other hand, I do not agree that the wealth of the country has no effect on the satisfaction of its inhabitants, because wealth provides opportunities for personal development, education and entertainment, which contribute to overall satisfaction. In other words, a growing economy brings a diminishing effect on the level of happiness. In conclusion, I agree that the effect of the wealth of the country on the satisfaction of its inhabitants can be limited, but I do not agree that an increase in the wealth of the country does not have any effect on the satisfaction of its inhabitants. In addition, economic growth can lead to the provision of public services and improvements in the life of citizens. For example, a rich country can make a large investment in the development of alternative energy, reduce pollution and improve public health, which, consequently, can increase the satisfaction of citizens. In the end, the relationship between the wealth of the country and the satisfaction of its inhabitants is a complex one, which is influenced by many factors, and a detailed study of this relationship is necessary. Economic growth still provides opportunities and improvements in the level of public services, which leads to an increase in the satisfaction of citizens.
1061;Some museums and art galleries charge admission fees, while others have free entry.Do you think the advantages of charging for admission outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many artistic places prefer to have an entry fee, whereas others let free access. I fully think that the benefits to have admission fees compensate the drawbacks to be not free.Many individuals would visit museum or art galleries if it were free which could attract more tourists. Unfortunately, admission charge decreases the possibility to discover paintings or masterpieces. However, before being a cultural place, art galleries are a place where numerous employees work. Indeed, if visitors had not to purchase the entrance, workforce would be not paid and the place would be not clean as museum should be. Moreover, huge museums as the British Museum have some sponsors to restore masterpieces whereas small museums have sometimes not the fundings and hence, admission fees would help it. Then, having an entry fee limit the number of individuals who do not really want to see art and appreciate the place.Concerning to cultural places, museum and art galleries know that many households could not afford ticket entrances for their offspring so many museums establish reduced price for teenagers and children. This project improves the relation between young people and the culture, then it allows children to be attracted to culture, partipate to the technical expenses behind the entry fee and after to visit again some cultural places when they will grow up and purchase the full price. Moreover, purchasing tickets help to the economy of the country which sometimes famous cultural places are a significant part of country's income. For instance, admission fees in museum are two third of the tourism's outcome in France.To conclude, I believe that admission fees should outweigh free entrance because it does not let the worth process of museum to work. Even if sometimes admission fees are costly for us, there is always a meaning behind the prices.; To my mind, the disadvantages of charging for admission outweigh the advantages. The debate about whether or not museums and galleries should charge an entrance fee has aroused great controversy. Some people argue that charging is a necessity, others that it prevents the public from getting access to art and culture. They point out that charging for admission provides museums with a useful source of income, which they can use to maintain and improve the displays. For example, the Louvre in Paris charges an entrance fee to preserve its magnificent collection of art, which includes the Mona Lisa. To begin with, it restricts access to art and culture for people who cannot afford to pay, which in turn can deepen the existing gap between rich and poor, who are denied the opportunity of getting to know art and culture. On the other hand, I believe that the disadvantages of charging for admission are more serious. In conclusion, although charging for admission to a museum or gallery has some advantages, I believe the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Free admission can actually increase visitor numbers and the local economy, because more people are likely to visit the museum and spend money in the surrounding area. For example, the National Museum of Scotland has recently reduced its admission charge, and the number of visitors has increased. Moreover, access to art and culture should be a fundamental right, not a privilege of the rich. Therefore, free admission is an important way of encouraging equality and helping local economies.
1355;Some parents encourage young people to leave home while others think they should stay with the family, discuss and give your opinion;Many parents encourage young people to leave home when they become older, while others think they should stay at home with the family. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.With the tremendous influence of modernisation, remarkable changes have taken place in the family structure to such an extent that nowadays, youngsters are motivated by their parents to live alone as they grow up. However, some people are of the view that it is more practical for a youngster to live with their family.On the one hand, there are many positive aspects to youths living away from their parents at young age. This provides the opportunity to young people to live a life on their own terms and make any decisions without the interference of their parents. Besides, living alone not only makes them independent but also makes them self-reliant, which is a crucial life skill to their successful career. For instance, managing all the house chores such as cleaning, paying bills, cooking and so on will make them well experienced at learning and managing diverse activities and will also boost their confidence.On the other hand, there is no denying the fact that youngsters living away from their family may find themselves in circumstances that may adversely affect their life. Naïve and inexperienced young people in the absence of parental supervision are more likely to fall prey to bad influence and dangerous activities, such as drugs or alcohol consumption, which may jeopardise their career or lead them astray from moral values. However, this situation is less likely to take place with youngsters still living with their parents. Besides, emotional bonding and family relationships can be maintained better if everyone is living together under one roof.In my opinion, although encouraging youngsters to live alone may lead them to learn various life skills, negative aspects and risks associated with living alone can far outweigh the benefits.This response covers the task topic well, by discussing the positive and negative aspects of living alone as a young adult, and the writer’s opinion has also been included. Paragraphing helps to present ideas in an orderly way, and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay. There is some repetitive use of the word ‘make’ in the first body paragraph, which could have been avoided. Apart from that, the writer’s vocabulary seems to be quite rich and allows them to communicate ideas precisely and clearly. Overall, this essay seems to be worthy of IELTS Band 8.; . In this essay I will discuss both points of view and give my opinion on the matter. The decision to leave home is a matter of debate among parents. Some parents encourage their children to leave home early, while others think that they should stay with the family as long as possible. On the one hand, parents think that leaving home at a young age is good for children. It teaches them to be independent, self-reliant and responsible. On the other hand, some parents believe that their children should stay with their families as long as possible. They argue that family support and guidance are necessary for emotional and psychological development. In my opinion, I think the decision to leave home should depend on the individual and the circumstances of the child. For example, the family provides a secure and stable environment for the young people, which is very important in this difficult economic situation. In my opinion, parents should have a frank and honest discussion with their children about their own needs and feelings. In my opinion, this is the best way for young people to grow up and achieve their full potential.
1335;Some people believe that excessive use of modern technologies, such as computers and smartphones, is negatively affecting the reading and writing skills of our young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Parents and teachers in many countries are feeling increasingly concerned about the effect of digital devices on vital skills of school-aged children. They are alarmed by the declining ability of young people to read and write and its suspected link to the influence of modern technology, and I wholeheartedly share their view. This essay will outline the reasons to watch out for the consequences of widespread use of computers and mobile phones by our youngsters.Primary school is a very important period when children develop their fine motor skills, which are involved in learning to write. Time spent typing on a mobile phone or a tablet doesn’t contribute to the necessary workout of the small muscles in the hands and fingers of young people. Not only do they get less practice in writing but also fewer opportunities to train in spelling words, since the ‘autocorrect’ and ‘autocomplete’ features use the first few letters to guess the entire word, therefore making it unnecessary for the child to remember and type it correctly. Another companion of unrestrained use of mobile devices is the jargon that is often used in text messages, where words are shortened or distorted. Exposure to ‘texting’ tends to replace the correct words with abbreviations in young minds, causing their spelling accuracy to decline.Reading is another casualty of unrestricted access to smart devices. Video content can be more appealing and immersive for kids and they often are automatically drawn to it instead of books. Reading requires regular practice and needs to become a habit in order to fully develop as a skill; however, it is being perceived as a boring and labourious activity by many youngsters compared to effortless video-watching. Easy and instant access to videos and movies pushes books further down the list of preferences of young audience, and it takes a significant commitment from parents and teachers to ensure that children continue to read books.To sum up, modern technology can be a friend or a foe for young children, depending on the choices adults in their lives make, regulating the amount of screen time and its purpose. Without due care the writing and reading abilities of kids can be harmed by other, more enjoyable activities they can use the devices for."; Some people argue that modern technology has a negative effect on the reading and writing skills of young people. However, I only partially agree with this idea. The fact that digital devices have autocorrect and spellcheck can make young people reliant on them to fix their mistakes instead of correcting them themselves. As a result, the quality of their writing is declining. Besides, the flood of information on social networks and the Internet has a shortening of attention and lack of depth in reading and writing. Also, many writing communities and blogs encourage young people to write and share their ideas with others, which can help to improve their writing skills. On the other hand, the Internet and digital devices provide young people with many opportunities to improve their reading and writing skills. Parents, teachers and governments need to ensure that young people use these devices sensibly and benefit from them. In conclusion, although I agree that excessive use of modern technology can have a negative impact on the reading and writing skills of young people, I also believe that, when used properly, they can be useful and support literacy skills.
877;Some people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime. Others believe that there are better ways to reduce crime. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;The increasing number of criminals are appeared in a society where some people advocate the longer incarceration resulting in a reduction of crime. However, some are divided and think that a number of better ways can help lessen the cases of crime. Which strategy should be taken to tackle this problem? This essay attempts to explore the view of both sides.An increase in the rate of crimes is a raising concerns in the community. A longer prison sentence seems to be the straightforward method to impede the crimes caused. In fact, a continuous incarceration is no room for offenders to commit the crimes in the community. This seemingly becomes an immediate achievement in the short term period. Some people deeply believe the mindset of criminals can be eliminated by the deterrence effect of the longer sentences which deprive of a person's freedom in life. In addition, it is generally recognized that the offenders have to be punished in effect of their guilty acts. The outlaws deserve a lengthening prison term in which they repent their offenses resulting in a decline in the number of crimes.Indeed, the incarceration can limit the offender's actions in a place at some points. However, it is not difficult to find there is a higher rate of reoffending upon release from prison across the countries. In 2013, the U.S.A. had a reoffending rate of 52% which prisoners reoffended within a year of release with a record of 49.2% in the U.K. The proportion of reoffenders occupied nearly a half of criminals. It reveals that the prison sentences is not a effective way to decrease the number of criminal cases. This implies that a decline in the crimes can be achieved araising from a decline in the likelihood of reoffending. Rehabilitation during the course of their sentence can be adopted to tackle this problems. These include direct therapeutic interventions to address the psychological causes of criminal behaviours as well as services to prepare offenderes to successfully reintegrate into the community after release. Those actions include the provision of academic programmes, vocational courses and employment opportunities.My take on this is that the incarceration alone is rarely considered enough in the control of criminal cases. A longer prison term only increase the financial cost from the government, but it cannot lower the likelihood of criminal offenses. The governments have to address the root factors causing offenses is the prime issue to reduce the crimes.; The first view is that longer prison sentences are deterrents and prevent crime. The idea is that the fear of a long sentence deters offenders. In addition, criminals are removed from society and are less likely to commit new crimes. However, the second view is that longer prison sentences are not the most effective way to reduce crime and that preventing criminals is more effective than punishing them. In my opinion, although longer prison sentences may provide a temporary solution, they do not really solve the problem. Instead, they argue that the costs of punishment should be used for rehabilitation programs, social services, and community development to address the underlying problems that lead to crime, and thus to reduce crime. This second view is that in the long run, a combination of punishment and rehabilitation is more likely to reduce crime than a combination of punishment and rehabilitation. I think a more integrated approach, with rehabilitation, education and community development, is more likely to produce long-term results.
379;Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;This essay agrees on the need of that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities, but always under one premise: those students should have demonstrated their capability to comply with university studies successfully.There are countries, for example Scandinavian countries, where their government helps students by giving them specific students' loans. These loans have special characteristics such as long loan terms and low interest rates. It is not for free, but at least a higher number of students can have access to upgrade their studies.And in many other European countries university fees are not large, so most of the students can access to bachelor studies. What it's not easy is having the needed qualification you need to access to the specific university study you want.If we talk in worlwide terms, university studies are limited to wealthy people.In fact I read only a couple of weeks ago that only a 17% of worlds' population have university studies. There is a contradiction between developped and non developped countries. As an example, in most countries in Europe we have too many university students. Actually they cannot find a job easily at their own country and sometimes they emigrate to another country in Europe or outside Europe. Furthermore vocational workers such as plumbers, waiters or receptionists can't be found, there no unemployment in vocational work!.The opposite happens in non developped countries. As university studies have large fees, almost nobody can access to them, and vocational workers suffer unemployment, so they need to emigrate to other countries to find jobs.To summarize, I believe fees should not be an obstacle to study in a university. The obstable should be your previous califications.Education and Health, as much as a country can hold them, should be available for all population, poor and wealthy, with non differentiation.; There is a lot of debate about whether governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Some people argue that government should pay full course fees for university students, but I disagree with this statement partly. It is true that if the government can pay full course fees for university students, university students will be able to study more freely and it will be more accessible to low-income students to achieve their goals, and in the end this will lead to a more educated and skilled workforce and bring positive changes to the economy. Then, there will be more people who are highly educated and can make more contributions to the economy. But at the same time, it is also true that if the government pays full course fees for university students, it will impose a large financial burden on the government, and the cost of free university education is too high, which will lead to a shortage of public funds for other urgent needs, such as health and social security. In my opinion, although the government should help university students, but it is better to help the needy students, rather than paying full course fees for all students. In this way, the government can help students who can't afford it.
1428;Some people believe that having a pet such as a cat or a dog helps old people to live a more enjoyable life and to stay healthier. How do you think old people benefit from having a pet? Do you think there are any problems related to old people who have pets?;, and indeed, the importance of relationship between human beings and their pets has been proved to be slightly exaggerated in some nations. However, although problems regarding may affect the health conditions of old people, the benefits that these lovely animals bring to them, physically and mentally alike, are clearly undeniable.In of physical benefits, the well-being of elderly people with pets compared to those without pets, since not only do they have to take care of themselves, the responsibility ensure their one fed and well looked after encourages them to become even more active. Due to these extra activities, this might not have an obvious influence on their health, but at least this could help them to avoid bad . Coupled with physical side, their mental wellbeing will also be improved, and the reason is that having someone to take care of would reduce the chance of feeling . Therefore, their could be minimised.In spite of the above advantages, the interaction between pets and vulnerable old people still exist. One of the major concerns is the of these animal on their tracheas, especially those asthma. virtually invisible in the air, many asthma symptoms are caused unconsciously by pets. In addition to the fact that old people might experience difficulty in looking after their pets, as their health conditions are limited, could become even more when they try take care of others.In conclusion, it is true that obstacles still exist for elderly people in adopting pets, but the benefits of this topic its . For such reasons, instead of , further support would be far more beneficial.; I firmly believe that having a pet can be a great benefit for old people. Older people often experience loneliness and lack of physical activity, which affect their health both mentally and physically. One way to help overcome these problems is to have a pet such as a cat or a dog. Older people can get the opportunity to walk their dogs and play with their cats, which are good ways to keep healthy. Having a pet helps old people in many ways: it makes them feel less lonely and increases their social life. Pets also have the ability to reduce blood pressure, reduce cholesterol, and reduce the size of the body. There are also some problems related to old people having pets. It is difficult for old people to take care of pets when they are not in good health. For example, taking care of a pet requires physical strength, especially for old people with health problems. The cost of the food and the cost of medical care and equipment for pets is also difficult for old people who are living on a pension. Older people have to plan carefully to take care of their pets, but if they do, they can get many benefits, and they can live a more enjoyable life.
1300;Some people believe that homework should not be given to school children. Others, however, say that homework is an important requirement for children to be able to develop appropriately. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The benefits of giving or not giving homework to children are often debated. Some people feel that children have enough work to do during one day whilst at school, whereas others feel that the more work set, the better.It is true that schools today place more and more demands and pressure on children. The competition to do well, to enter a good university and to get a good job is significant. This has led to the ideology that children should do as much schoolwork as possible in order to help their intellectual development. The argument, however, that more is better is not always valid. There comes a point, especially for a child, when more knowledge cannot be absorbed in a day. When a child has possibly 7 or 8 classes a day on different subjects, he or she is processing a lot of information already. To give more work to be done at home, therefore, would be pointless and even counterproductive. In addition to this, although it is important to be educated, childhood should also be a time when there is an opportunity to just play and enjoy unstructured time. Homework can significantly lessen the possibilities of doing this.On the other hand, it can be argued that there is a place for homework. If study at school is not overdone, the opportunity to look at work again and extend ideas can be an invaluable exercise. It’s easy to forget one thing that has been taught once, but if that concept is revisited a second time, the brain has time to reprocess and likely better understand and remember.It seems to me that there is a place for homework for today’s children. What must be remembered, though, is that homework needs to be limited to age-appropriate parameters, so that a balance can be struck between study and free time and relaxation.; This essay will discuss both views and give my own opinion on the subject. Whether homework should be given to children is a question that has been debated for many years. On the one hand, those who argue that homework is not good for children say that it makes children anxious and makes them lose time to play and rest, which is essential for their physical and mental health. In addition, they argue that homework can reduce the child's imagination and creativity because it makes them focus on finishing tasks rather than learning naturally. However, those who argue that homework is useful for children claim that homework helps them review and practice what they have learned in class and helps them develop more skills such as time management, self-discipline and critical thinking. Homework should be given to children, but only in moderation. One Finnish study has shown that Finnish children who are given enough homework did better in their exam results and learned to manage their time better than children who are given too much homework. Homework should therefore be given to children, but with consideration to the amount and type of homework, so that it is not harmful to their development.
1369;Some people believe that preserving natural environment is crucial, but make no effort to do so (reasons and solutions);Some people believe that preserving natural environment is crucial, however, most make no effort to do so. Why do you think this is happening? What are some simple actions that could help the environment?It is commonly believed that preservation of natural resources is imperative, yet most people seem to exert no effort in doing so. Understanding the causes of this negligent attitude may help with devising some simple measures to safeguard the deteriorating environment.Lack of awareness is probably the foremost reason why the vast majority of individuals appears to be unmindful of the current environmental issues. Normally, people have tendency to downplay abstract problems, or those to happen in the distant future. This is because they are not properly informed of the possible detrimental effects of taking the environment for granted. To illustrate, residents in urban areas often deliberately dump their into the nearby creeks and drainage canals causing them to become clogged. It is only when devastating floods strike, that they come to realize the consequences of their actions.Some basic solutions that could be carried out are extensive awareness through all forms of communication and strict implementation of waste management. In addition to the traditional press, social media is a powerful means of disseminating information regarding the impending disasters and their potential hazards. This is a good way of persuading the public to actively take part in the campaign. Another straightforward solution, and by far the least anyone can do to help save the nature is disposing of garbage thoughtfully. Apart from avoiding throwing trash anywhere, everyone should practice proper segregation of biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and recyclable wastes at all times. These actions, when coordinated by the local governments, can be tremendously successful.In conclusion, while individual awareness is key to maintaining a healthy ecosystem, concerted efforts of governments and are much more effective in achieving such goal.The response is well written, it contains reasons, solutions and fully addresses the task. The ideas aren’t repeated, they are conveyed in a clear and easy to understand manner and organised well with sufficient use of cohesive devices. The vocabulary is varied, sentence structures are complex and instances of incorrect grammar are hardly noticeable. Overall, this essay is likely to achieve Band 8 in IELTS.; As it is evident, despite the knowledge of the importance of natural environment, many people do not take action to protect it. There are several reasons for this inconsistency between knowledge and action. But the main reason is ignorance of simple daily actions that contribute to the preservation of the environment. It is not uncommon for people to believe that only large and complicated actions can help save the environment. Also, it is influenced by social and cultural influences that are common in a society, for example, in the belief that if a person is trying to preserve the environment, then he is somehow compromising the economic progress of the country. Governments and corporations should take an active part in the implementation of sustainable development programs, and provide the population with inexpensive and effective ways to preserve the environment. The gap between knowledge and action can be reduced by several means. Firstly, an information campaign could be started to inform people about the simple, but significant, changes they can make in their daily lives, such as using less plastic, using water more sparingly and using public transport. Next, community initiatives to encourage people to work together for the preservation of the environment could create a sense of responsibility and motivation in individuals.
1322;Some people believe that the best way to solve environmental problems is to increase the price of fuel.Do you agree or disagree?;"Raising the price of car fuel is believed by some people to be an excellent method to solve the growing number of environmental issues. However, I strongly disagree with this idea, as doing so would make life difficult for lower-income households. While making fuel more expensive wouldn’t change the habits of wealthy families, switching to fossil fuel alternatives could prove to be much more beneficial for the environment.The most compelling reason against raising the cost of fuel is that the upper classes of society will hardly be affected by rising fuel costs, as this only makes up a minor proportion of their expenditure. They will continue to use their personal vehicles as they wish without a thought for the environment or the higher fuel prices, even if their country has state-of-the-art public transportation.Those who will feel the crunch of this decision are the middle-class and lower-income households, since travelling is a major part of most people’s routine, be it to work, school or shopping. Driving is almost unavoidable in many instances; therefore, raising the price of petrol would only serve to widen the gap between the rich and poor, and serve as an inadvertent form of discrimination.Another reason why increasing the cost of fuel is far from the best way to deal with environmental pollution is that now there are much more viable alternatives. Due to the rapid advances in technology, scientists and engineers have been able to develop several alternatives to fossil fuel, such as cars powered by electricity or naturally produced biofuel. The move to adopt clean energy sources instead of fossil fuels is a much more promising alternative compared to simply making fuel more expensive.In conclusion, I believe that governments of the world should invest more time and money in finding alternatives to fossil fuels that are more environmentally friendly, rather than simply raising the cost of petrol."; This paper will argue that the price of fuel should be increased to reduce the environment. ? The environment is a serious issue in the world, and many solutions have been proposed to solve it. Rising fuel prices reduce fuel consumption because people have less of a tendency to use fuel-hungry vehicles and machines, reducing the amount of greenhouse gases emitted and reducing air pollution. Besides, the rise in fuel prices encourages individuals and companies to invest in the development of alternative energy sources such as solar energy and wind power, which are safer and more sustainable. Not only can this reduce the damage to the environment caused by the use of fossil fuels, but it can also be used to promote sustainable development. However, high fuel prices will increase the burden on the environment for lower-income families and small businesses. In this regard, it is necessary to consider the subsidization of fuel by the government. In the end, the rising price of fuel is a good solution to solve the environment, reducing the use of fossil fuels, promoting the development of alternative energy sources, and generating funds for the environment. To the extent that the government can set up subsidies or tax cuts to help these groups, the problem can be solved. Ultimately, I believe that the rising price of fuel is the most effective way to solve the environment, and that it is an important way to protect the environment for future generations.
1273;Some people believe that we cannot learn anything from the past for our life today, while others believe that history is a valuable source of information to understand human's life.Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is true that these days people say there is little we can gain from previous history, whereas others think that history is a key source to understand our lives. Although there are some strong arguments against learning history, I agree with learning history to know life of human.There are two reasons why people think there is nothing to gain from history. Firstly, there is evidence to support the idea that learning history stresses people out. Based on a survey conducted by Standford University, 57 percent of people consider learning past life of humans a primary source of stress, while less than 6 percent of people said studying previous humans' life was not a stressor. Secondly, people may not have time to remember historical events because the constant stimulation and hustle and bustle of society is holding them back from their life. In turn, they are more likely to regard learning history as useless.Despite the negative drawbacks, I support that historical event is great information to comprehend human's life. The main benefit of a historical event is that it can have a positive impact on people, especially children, as they grow up. Since history has more connection and support to our lives, it allows children to become more insightful and knowledgeable and discover advanced perspectives. For example, I have been widening my perspective through historical events in my family or country because gaining history regarding my family and nation taught me the right attitude to understand today. However, if I did not know any history, I would not have had an opportunity to understand human life and self-development. So, learning history should be encouraged.In conclusion, while I recognize the possible disadvantages of learning history, I believe that the benefits of gaining past events far outweigh them in the long term.; History is not a useful lesson for our life. Some people say that the world is changing and that we can't learn from the past. There is a dispute between people on the importance of learning from the past. The rise and fall of empires, the consequences of wars and the impact of movements on society can teach us a lot about how to govern, what is important for diplomacy and what is the basis for a fair society. On the other hand, some people believe that history is a source of valuable information for human life. History is full of examples of success and failure, and by studying the past, we can learn from the mistakes of others and build on the achievements of others. Personally, I think the second view is the right one. History is a rich source of information that can enrich our understanding of human life. I firmly believe that we can learn a lot from the past and make progress today. For example, the Great Depression taught us the importance of good economic management, and the civil rights movement gave us the idea of equality and justice.
1342;Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military, while others disagree (opinion);Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military. Others think that women are less suitable for this kind of job. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Sample EssayIn recent years gender equality in employment has been the topic of heated debate. While some may argue that women are less suited for certain jobs such as with the police or the military, I believe that female candidates should be treated the same as their male counterparts.Those who consider women to be unsuited for some kinds of jobs including the police or the military often hold that opinion because such jobs are extremely physically demanding. As the female body has smaller muscles and less physical strength compared to male body, women may have difficulty engaging in strenuous activity which can be exhausting even for men. In military service, female soldiers are more likely to struggle while defending themselves than their male peers when they are forced to move around carrying heavy firearms in the battle, which can increase their risk of mission failure. Because of the hazards and extreme conditions they may encounter, some people advocate that women are not suitable for work in these fields.Nevertheless, I believe that female applicants should be considered for police or military placements without a gender bias, because women are more suited to certain tasks. In the police service, female officers can perform important roles on some occasions such as a body search where male officers are restricted from touching female convicts. In the military service, female nursing staff are more likely to care better for injured soldiers since maternal instinct makes them dedicated and heart-warming professionals. Furthermore, for the sake of fairness to all, job seekers should have an equal opportunity to choose their jobs freely, regardless of gender. Many women have the desire to work in the police and the military and some of them have relevant expertise and qualifications. Therefore, they should not be discriminated against in employment opportunities for these jobs.In conclusion, although some say that women are incompatible with police and military duties because of the high physical demands, I believe that they should be treated as equal to men. This is because there are certain roles with the police and the military that are more suitable for women than men, and therefore both genders should have equal employment opportunities.; . On the one hand, people argue that women have the same abilities as men, so they should be given the same opportunity. It is a controversial issue for many years. On the other hand, others argue that some jobs in the police and the military require physical strength and endurance that is not suitable for women. The latter opinion is based on the principle of gender equality, which states that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men in all areas of life, including work. In fact, women have made important contributions to the police and the military, which has made them more effective and diverse. This argument is often based on stereotypes about women's abilities and does not take into account the fact that many women have proven themselves capable and brave in such roles. They also fear for the health and safety of women in extreme situations. However, the ability of women to perform the same tasks as men is not a matter of gender, but is a matter of physical strength. The ability of women to perform the same work as men is based on the principles of justice, equality and the recognition of women's abilities. Moreover, the police and the military, which treat women as equals, will benefit from a wider pool of knowledge and experience, which can lead to better outcomes and more sensitive decisions. Strengthen these institutions and promote equality in society. It is important to break the stereotypes and prejudices that prevent women from serving in these areas and to create an environment in which women can serve with respect and dignity.
1376;Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research (discuss);Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research for the benefit of human beings, while others argue that it is wrong. Discuss both views and give your opinion.People have different views on how medical research should be conducted and tested. Although many people support the use of for developing medicines, I personally believe that animal testing is morally wrong.The main reason why some people value to conduct medical research is because animal testing has contributed to many life-saving cures and treatments. It is true that nearly every medical breakthrough in the last 100 years has resulted directly from research using animals. For example, experiments in which dogs had their pancreases removed led directly to the discovery of insulin, critical to saving the lives of diabetics. Furthermore, it is impossible to release to the market before proving it no harm to humans and laboratory mice are appropriate research subjects because they are similar to human beings in many ways.However, I people who consider medical development that involved the use of animals cruel and unacceptable. I believe that the lives of all creatures should be respected and we, humans, have no right to for our own benefits. Governments should invest in developing alternative methods that can replace when doing medical research. For example, a software program can be developed to model a human immune system and new drugs can be tested on the software rather than animals. In this way, no animals will suffer from the medical tests and the society can still benefit from medical development.In conclusion, although it is undoubtedly true that animal testing has helped scientists in drug developments and medical discoveries, I believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused to animals and we should use alternative methods when doing medical research that do not involve animals suffering.This is a great essay. It addresses the two sides of the argument by exploring reasons why animals should and should not be used in medical research. The ideas are well explained and supported by examples. The use of paragraphing is efficient and helps with logical sequencing of ideas. Linking words are used appropriately to achieve the necessary cohesion. Author’s meaning is skillfully conveyed by the use of wide range of vocabulary. Even though there are some inaccurately used expressions, they don’t hinder understanding. Most sentences are error-free, instances of faulty grammar are rare. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.; (required). Many people have argued that animal experiments are needed to develop medicine and health. They argue that animal experiments have led to the development of vaccines, antibiotics, and treatments for cancer. In addition, they argue that alternatives such as computer simulations and in vitro testing are equally effective. On the other hand, there are many people who strongly oppose the use of animals in medical research because of ethical and moral considerations. Many medical scientists have argued that animal experiments are strictly regulated and that animal well-being is carefully considered. However, proponents of animal experiments argue that these alternatives are not yet advanced enough to replace animal experiments. To sum up, although there are many arguments on both sides, animal experiments have made great progress in medical science. However, ethical considerations should be taken into account, and it is necessary to continue to develop alternatives. This will help the development of human health and medicine, while reducing the suffering of animals.
1057;Some people feel that entertainers such as film stars, pop musicians or sports stars are paid too much money.Do you agree or disagree?Which other types of job should be highly paid?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Jobs such as actors, musicians or athlete earns a lot of money, however, a part of people argued that these kinds of people are overpaid. In my opinion, I disagree with this view and believes that they deserved the high salary.People who works as a movie stars, musicians and sports player deserved high money paid. This is because they advocated all there time and effort to get the salary that they have today. Before they become famous, they only have few incomes or even get nothing. That is to say, many musicians did not get any payment at the begining of their career, so do the actors and sports players, they spent their time but do not get any money. For instance, before being a well-known musicians, they have to spend their own money on buying equipment to produce musics or to public the songs they have made. Also, the creativety and their works cannot be measured by money. Thus, they deserved high salary because of their profession and uncopyable works.Jobs which needs professional skills and the job envolves high risk shoul also be highly paid. Such as doctors and programmers, their job are unplaceable because these envolved professional knowledge that not everyone had. Moreover, people works in high-risk environment deserved high payment too. For example, fire-fighters, they might got hurt or even die while working. Therefore, higher salary is needed for jobs that need special skills and career with high risk.To sum up, I agree with the statement because of the reasons above, and jobs with special knowledge and people works in dangerous environment should also be highly paid.; It is a popular topic of debate that entertainers, such as film stars, pop stars or sports stars, are paid too much. In my opinion, these people are paid too much for their work. They bring joy and entertainment to millions of people, but they are often overpaid for their work. On the other hand, many people who contribute a lot to the well-being of society, such as teachers, nurses and social workers, are underpaid. Furthermore, professions that require a lot of education, skills and risks, such as doctors, engineers and firefighters, should be paid a lot more. These people have a very difficult education and risk their lives to protect the public. The quality of life of many people is directly influenced by their work. In short, although entertainers do add to the quality of life, it is excessive compared to other professions that contribute a lot to the well-being of society. The priorities must be changed and the value of work must be recognized that is really useful for people. Doctors have studied for years and have special skills that help save lives and help people. Doctors should be rewarded for their work. We must therefore create a fairer, more equitable system that rewards people for the true value they create.
1289;Some people feel that fashion is like art and a significant part of society, while others feel that fashion is a waste of time and money.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"The fashion industry today is an important component of society and people’s lives. It is true that many people care little for clothes and scorn the importance that others attach to them; however, this does not mean that the significance that people give to fashion is a waste of time and money.When one considers that areas of the world suffer from poverty, disease and inadequate access to food and clean water, the emphasis attached to fashion by the developed world can seem out of proportion. Many people would contend that the resources put into developing and creating fashion would be more ethically spent on creating some level of equality in terms of the right to live a healthy and happy life. This point is hard to argue with. However, it is also true that people in the developed world cannot be expected to send all their spending money to people in need and that wanting to look good is an unalterable human trait.The fashion industry contributes to the society much like most other industries. It provides jobs and income to millions of people around the world and the money that changes hands generates taxes that contribute to the fabric of society. There is more to fashion than trying to look better than others and excessive luxury. The high level of fashion is indeed a kind of art form and, like other art forms, there will always be people who appreciate it, want to create it and want to spend money on it. It is part of the development of civilisation and this is not likely to change.I therefore feel that, although the gap between the rich and the poor sometimes makes it seem that fashion is a waste of time and money and an unethical use of resources, fashion is an important part of today’s society and economic output. This leads me to believe that trying to strike a balance between selfish greed and a more altruistic way of living should be an individual choice."; This is what I wrote for this task: On the one hand, those who are against fashion say that it is a superficial and materialistic way of life that encourages people to put appearance before substance. Fashion also has a major role in the economy, generating employment and producing income. For example, the famous Met Gala, a large fashion event, is not only a platform for high-fashion celebration, but also a platform for the dissemination of social and political issues. In addition, fashion is often criticized for its lack of diversity and inclusiveness, and for promoting an unrealistic beauty standard. In my opinion, fashion is more than just a trivial aspect of society. It is possible for fashion to support sustainable practices, diversity, and body positivity. For example, brands such as Patagonia and Reformation are leading the way in terms of promoting ethical and sustainable fashion. However, fashion is not without its shortcomings. In conclusion, I feel that, although there are valid criticisms of the fashion industry, its artistic and cultural value, as well as its potential for social change, makes it a meaningful and significant part of society. Fashion has also been used as a platform for raising awareness of social issues such as breast cancer through the ‘Pink Ribbon’ campaign.
1073;Some people feel that the design of newly constructed buildings in big cities should be controlled by governments. Others believe those who finance the construction of a building should be free to design it as they see fit.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is often argued that governments should involve in construction's design in huge cities, while others argued that governments do not have to retrict the free of designers' imagination if those designs are splendid fit on the cities. I believe that if that were to happen, it would be the positive development. This essay will highlight the both views and give personal opinion from the former argument's side.To begin with latter opinion, although governments have worried about the combination of buildings entirely, the strong limitation about design can cause squandering of designers' skills. There are huge number of competitions about designing building in this society, and the evolution in these fields has developed dramatically. However, if there is a strict criteria on design of building, the majority of intelligences do not need to hammer away to come up with revolutional outline for building.On the other hand, signitured design of the big cities by itself can be the purpose of trevelling as a landmark, and it can be followed by significant economical achievement in the country. To take myself as an example, in 2017, I went to Gold Coast for study automotive engineering, and I was stunnied becaused of the atmosphere which is formed by combination of similar buildings and beach. Furthermore, according to the research from Sydney university, Gold Coast is one of the cities which make a fortune because of marvelous view.To sum up with, I would therefore argue that in spite of the fact that building design restriction can influence on architects negatively, it has a potential ability to make a significant profit in the future.; It has long been a matter of debate whether or not the design of newly built houses should be controlled by governments. Some people have argued that this would prevent ugly buildings from being built and prevent buildings that would destroy the harmony of the city. Others argue that those who finance the construction of a building should be free to design it. This view emphasizes the importance of creativity and innovation in architecture, allowing builders to create unique and iconic buildings that represent the city's diversity. For example, the city of Paris has a long history and a certain building style, and it should not be destroyed. But it is also important to create an environment that allows creative building. My view is that the government should take a balanced approach and ensure that buildings comply with basic safety and hygiene regulations, but also give builders a certain amount of freedom to show their creativity. For example, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, designed by Frank Gehry, has attracted millions of visitors and has been a major boost to the local economy. I believe that by creating a balance between control and creativity, cities can be vibrant and dynamic centers of innovation and progress. This can be achieved by providing flexible land use and incentives for sustainable and innovative design.
1292;Some people feel that with the rise of artificial intelligence, computers and robots will take over the roles of teachers. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;With ever increasing technological advances, computers and robots are replacing human roles in different areas of society. This trend can also be seen in education, where interactive programs can enhance the educational experience for children and young adults. Whether, however, this revolution can also take over the role of the teacher completely is debatable, and I oppose this idea as it is unlikely to serve students well.The roles of computers and robots can be seen in many areas of the workplace. Classic examples are car factories, where a lot of the repetitive precision jobs done on assembly lines have been performed by robots for many years, and medicine, where diagnosis, and treatment, including operations, have also been assisted by computers for a long time. According to the media, it won’t also be long until we have cars that are driven automatically.It has long been discussed whether robots and computers can do this in education. It is well known that the complexity of programs can now adapt to so many situations that something can already be set up that has the required knowledge of the teacher, along with the ability to predict and answer all questions that might be asked by students. In fact, due to the nature of computers, the knowledge levels can far exceed a teacher’s and have more breadth, as a computer can have equal knowledge in all the subjects that are taught in school, as opposed to a single teacher’s specialisation. It seems very likely, therefore, that computers and robots should be able to deliver the lessons that teachers can, including various ways of differentiating and presenting materials to suit varying abilities and ages of students.Where I am not convinced is in the pastoral role of teachers. Part of teaching is managing behaviour and showing empathy with students, so that they feel cared for and important. Even if a robot or computer can be programmed to imitate these actions, students will likely respond in a different way when they know an interaction is part of an algorithm rather than based on human emotion.Therefore, although I feel that computers should be able to perform a lot of the roles of teachers in the future, they should be used as educational tools to assist teachers and not to replace them. In this way, students would receive the benefits of both ways of instruction.; For example, a teacher’s role is not just to teach something. Compared with that, the functions that can be done by artificial intelligence are much more limited. I think the role of teachers is much more than just giving students knowledge, which is the main function of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence does not have emotional intelligence and cannot understand human emotions and feelings, and even if it is very intelligent, it cannot understand the fine nuances of human behavior. First, teaching is not only teaching knowledge, but also teaching children to be good people. Also, in the classroom, there are many complex interactions such as discussions, debates and group work, which require creativity, intuition and critical thinking. This kind of personal approach cannot be achieved by the current artificial intelligence. The teaching process is very context-sensitive, and human teachers are better able to modify their teaching methods according to the needs and responses of the students. Also, artificial intelligence cannot make people think and learn deeply. In the end, artificial intelligence will undoubtedly play a positive role in education, such as providing individualized learning materials, helping with administrative work and providing instant feedback, but it is unlikely to completely replace human teachers. In fact, such skills are not just about processing information, but also about understanding the meaning, questioning the premise and looking at it from different perspectives. Artificial intelligence cannot provide such experiences at this time. Artificial intelligence in education is therefore more of a complementary tool for human teachers.
1285;Some people like to own the place where they live, but other people like to rent where they live. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The debate over whether it is better to own or rent the property in which one lives is one that has strong supporters on each side. There are persuasive arguments for both points of view.One of the main advantages of renting a property is flexibility. Usually, a tenant only has to give a month’s notice before changing where he or she lives. If a property is owned and a change is needed, the property must be put onto the market and it is frequently a long and stressful process to get a sale completed. Sometimes, the wrong time of year or a bad market can mean that a sale is not possible. Another advantage of renting is that a large amount of a family’s capital is not tied up in the property. Property can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and often a lot more. If one rents, this money can be spent on other things to help improve the family’s quality of life. If the property is on a mortgage, then the deposit, also often very large, is tied up in the property and the pressure of having to make substantial payments every month can cause a lot of stress.Owning a property does have various advantages, though. Even though people usually have to service a mortgage every month with payments, this money is then built up with the property. With renting, the money is lost to the landlord, but at the end of the term of the mortgage, the whole property is owned by the family. This makes the process of living in a property a type of investment. In addition, the property’s value often goes up after time, frequently creating a substantial profit. Owning the property where one lives can also create a sense of well-being and self-actualisation.The decision to whether one rents or owns the property in which one lives really boils down to individual preference. My opinion is that it is much more preferable to own a property, mainly because it creates a valuable asset for the family.; For example, when a home owner does not need to consult the landlord about making improvements to the house, they can feel more independent and have more freedom to live in the house. The debate about whether to buy or rent a house has been going on for years. Buying a house has its advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, it gives a person freedom and flexibility to move around and be unfettered by a certain place. On the other hand, it is not the responsibility of the landlord to pay for repairs and renovations, which can be very expensive. A house is also an investment that may increase in value over time, which can provide a source of income in the future. But in my opinion, renting is the more practical and desirable option, especially for young people and people who like flexibility. For example, a tenant can move to a new city for work or personal reasons without worrying about selling a property and dealing with the complexities of ownership from a distance. Renting is also a cheaper option for those who are not ready to take on a long-term mortgage. On the other hand, the money saved from the down payment and mortgage can be used for something else, such as a pension plan or a small business. With the high cost of living and the uncertainty of job security, renting gives a tenant more freedom and flexibility. Whether to rent or buy a home depends on the individual circumstances and priorities.
1405;Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding changes. Others, however think that change is always a good thing. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;Nowadays, people are arguing whether an ideal lifestyle should be a stable one or should it include a wide ranges of changes.In my opinion, whether changes are needed should be determined the of you are at.Apparently, are favorable the development of young people, in to their careers. Primarily, an abundant experience in varieties of jobs enables the young to master a broad range of techniques and skills, leading to significant edge over counterparts in the competition for employment. Meanwhile, trying various roles in life and work provides wide of lifestyles for the young in the future. Only after this comparison can they realize what the real goals of their .However, other than frequent changes, the elderly who have undergone all these challenges may pursue a steady lifestyle. For the elders, concentration on their favorite activities would give rise to a sense of enjoyment and security, which is helpful to physical and psychological health. Due to a stable life, the elderly are less exposed to stress, leading to a decrease in adrenal hormones and resulting in their well-.Furthermore, degeneration of mental and physical function would make the elderly unlikely to adapt to external changes, causing and , which are not contributing to their health.Above all, it is unlikely to describe the changes in life with a positive or negative term. Accommodation for personal needs and goals is more important than the changes themselves.; There are two different ways to look at this question. On the one hand, some people prefer to stay in the same routine, because it makes them feel comfortable and less anxious. This helps them to build a strong foundation and grow in the same patterns, reducing uncertainty and fear. On the other hand, some people think that change is always a good thing, because it brings new experiences, opportunities and personal development. For example, a person who has a secure job might want to continue in the same place, because it provides a stable income and a clear understanding of the responsibility. While a person who is taking a new course or going abroad for a holiday may find that it enriches their lives. In my opinion, it is necessary to combine stability and change to have a fulfilling life. Change can also bring new ideas, a different way of solving problems and a wider outlook on life. On the other hand, continuous change can cause anxiety and overwhelm a person. There is a need for a certain routine in life, because it provides security and certainty, but it can also be boring and depressing. Having a combination of change and stability is the best way to live a happy, active and purposeful life.
1423;Some people say education is the only critical factor to the development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;One the one hand good education is a highly recommended skill in the developed countries, on the other hand of many people in regions of poverty. But what makes education key factor for the development of a countryWe must acknowledge that education is something that we all need. The differences are just what we learn. Mostly the limited educational horizons of poor and less educated people have more to deal with their personal situation than with problems of bigger effects on a country. Attending school is sometimes too expensive and it does not feed a family.Nevertheless there must be a reason for education. For me it looks like some countries have realized that Education is the key for the globalization process. If we take India for example we can see that a change in the educational system had changed the economy of the country. country has changed from a poor region to a high potential for IT knowledge.In regard to this fact of education seriously and offer it to a wide range of people. Spending money education is the key tippy title=”for”]to[/tippy] a new future effects on the economy and social life. All in all I agree with the importance of education for the development of a country. Less knowledge leads to poverty and . Learning and Knowledge is Power and an investment in the near future and therefore it has to be an official task.; I think that although education plays an important role in the development of the country, it is not the only critical factor. There is a debate among scholars and policymakers on whether education is the only critical factor to the development of a country. Education can help people develop the knowledge and skills they need to participate in the world economy, and therefore promote development. Moreover, an educated population is more likely to engage in democracy, making the citizens more informed and involved in the process of decision making. An educated populace is more likely to support a stable political system, a health care system, and a business-friendly environment. However, many other factors are equally, if not more, critical to the development of a country. In a word, the development of a country is a complex, multifaceted process that involves the combination of a well-educated populace, a solid infrastructure, and good government, with access to critical resources such as water, sanitation, and energy. In conclusion, although education is undoubtedly an important part of a country's development, it is not the only critical factor. Therefore, we should have a more holistic understanding of the role of education and other factors in development.
87;Some people say free time activities for children should be organized by parents. Others say that children should be free to choose what they do in their free time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Whether parents should fully intervene in their children's organization of their leisure time or let them decide it, remains a big discussion. In this essay I will contrast the two opinions and I will explain why I think a good balance is needed.One of the reasons supporting the first view is the idea of the undeveloped children's ability to organize. This is because, although some of them might seem very mature for their age, others might struggle understanding the importance of having a routine, besides playing video games. For instance, many parents orientate their children helping them to organize hobbies and teaching a very important skill, time managment.On the other hand, some people encourage children to decide themselves what to do as this stimulates creativity and personal growth. This view, therefore, opens a new world for the little ones who can decide whatever they like, having multiple options. For example, children in this situation quite often are supported when they want to play sports or participate in a painting class.In my opinion, parents should not only be envolved as much as they can in all aspects of their children's lives, but also they might encourage the little ones to have personal opinions and decision about their hobbies and leisure actitivities. This may be a good way to build trust and communication between parents and children. Moreover, children learn responsability while being guided by their parents.In conclusion, some parents help their children more in scheduling their free time, while others intervene less leaving them to create a routine freely. I believe, parents should always be involved in their children's lives and decisions, allowing children participation too, which brings multiple benefits to their relationship.; It has long been a matter of debate among parents and experts whether children should be given free time or not. On the one hand, some people say children should have organized activities, which help them feel secure. They point out that organized activities, such as sports or music, help children develop important skills and make them socialize with other children. Children who are not given free time are less able to learn to make decisions, think creatively and make their own mistakes. Moreover, this approach to leisure can keep children in a safe and supervised environment, preventing them from harming themselves. On the other hand, others say that a balance should be found between these two approaches. Firstly, they say that an overly organized timetable can lead to stress and overwork, thus reducing the benefits of organized activities. Secondly, it gives children a chance to relax and recuperate, which is essential for their mental and physical health. Lastly, it is important for parents to understand their child’s individual needs and find the right balance for their child. It is important to have some time for organized activities, but at the same time it is important to let children explore their interests. They are happy, confident and healthy individuals, if they have been able to find a good balance between structure and free time.
1330;Some people say that all popular TV entertainment programmes should aim to educate viewers about important social issues. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It is often said that all influential TV entertainment programs should be geared towards raising people’s awareness about social issues that matter. While some TV programs could be suitable for this purpose, I disagree with the view that it should be mandatory for all of them, as the decision whether to do so must take into account the nature of the TV content and the channel’s audience.There is a large group of professionals who would benefit from deepening their understanding of what is happening in the world. Stock traders and bankers, for example, must always keep track of numerous business trends on a global scale, and they would appreciate this type of information on their favourite TV shows. Young people are another suitable audience due to the fact that they enjoy learning about popular topics from TV programmes. For instance, SDGs or the Sustainable Development Goals has now become an important topic to learn for children at school. Educational TV would provide a welcome alternative to textbooks, making learning more fun.Despite the potential advantages of incorporating educational content in TV programs, it is important to remember that the purpose of entertainment TV is for people to escape reality, to take a break from their hectic lives. Being reminded about some troubling social issues would not be appreciated by those who just want to unwind after a long day at work. Another consideration is how the content is perceived by the audience, because broadcasting serious topics as part of a comedy show might lead some viewers to believe they are of lesser significance. This would make TV shows of light-hearted nature a poor choice for inclusion of content on pressing social issues.In conclusion, entertainment TV programs can be an effective form of education for some people and a great tool to spread information. However, not all of them should be used for this purpose as there are various ways people appreciate them.; On the one hand, the impact of popular TV entertainment programs on their audience cannot be overestimated. But when it comes to the point that these programs should be aware of important social issues, I can only partially agree. The problem is that if these programs do raise awareness of important issues, such as the problems of racial discrimination, sexism, and environmental protection, then they will create a more knowledgeable and empathic audience, which is a prerequisite for a fair and equitable society. Because of the millions of people who watch them daily, they have the power to influence public opinion and cultural norms. But if the whole program tries to focus on raising awareness of social issues, it may lose its credibility and the audience will lose its popularity. On the other hand, the primary purpose of popular TV entertainment programs is to entertain the audience, not to teach it. The audience tunes in to have fun and to be entertained, not to be lectured. The best way is to strike a balance between the two aims, to show a more organic and respectful way of presenting the issue to the audience. In conclusion, I agree that popular TV entertainment programs can be aware of social issues, but they should not be the main purpose of them. There are other forms of communication, such as documentaries and news, that are better suited to arousing the audience's awareness of social issues. They can achieve their primary purpose without sacrificing entertainment value.
1353;Some people say that arts subjects are as essential as academic ones and should be part of school syllabus (agree/disagree);"Some people say that art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are an essential part of education, and every school should include them in its syllabus. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your opinion and examples from your own experience.Art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are fundamentals that enrich our lives. However, some parents say schools on teaching more academic subjects, such as mathematics, science, literature and history. In my opinion, both academic and arts subjects should be taught and I will expand on the pros and cons of including arts in the school program further on in this essay.On the one hand, academic subjects are often required when we get into higher . Academic subjects may be considered as in the academic world. Personally, I have never taken an entrance exam of art subjects for high school or university. In other words, schools measured my academic abilities using academic subjects, not art subjects. To suit the current educational system, many parents in my home country, Japan, send their children to cram schools to study academic subjects deeply.On the other hand, art subjects can strengthen the creativity and flexibility of individuals. Liberal arts, which include cultural understanding and knowledge, also include other arts subjects. In addition, we are living in the era of automation and artificial intelligence which are replacing human labor and office work more and more. In this regard, human creativity becomes more important. Therefore, art subjects are being more in demand to make a difference between individuals and computers.In conclusion, academic and arts subjects should blend in a school syllabus in a balanced way. Art subjects can also a better personality in individuals, so participation in these classes should be encouraged as well as academic achievements.The writer explored the reasons why including arts subjects in school syllabus is a good idea, while fluently expressing ideas and supporting them by examples. Correct paragraphing assists with orderly presentation of information, making this essay easy to follow; the range of vocabulary is quite wide. Accuracy of expression needs a bit more attention (see corrections underlined in blue), but overall, this essay could achieve IELTS Band 8."; . The arts, such as music, dance, and painting, give students the unique opportunity to express themselves creatively and develop their imagination. While some people argue that the arts are not as important as the academic subjects, I am firmly convinced that they are equally essential and should be part of the school curriculum. I will explain why I think so. Firstly, studying the arts develops students’ thinking skills, such as memory and concentration, as well as their ability to think critically. Secondly, it helps them develop self-confidence, which is crucial for their future lives. Moreover, the arts can enhance students’ academic performance. Students who take part in arts classes, such as painting and music, have been shown to score higher on subjects such as math and reading. Finally, studying the arts can help students explore their interests and talents, which will help them lead more fulfilling lives. Having said all that, I am firmly convinced that the arts are equally as essential as the academic subjects and should be included in the school curriculum. The reason for this is that studying the arts can develop students’ problem-solving skills, hand-eye coordination, and spatial reasoning, which are all essential skills for academic success. So it is important for schools to give students the opportunity to develop their creative talents. If we give them a chance to study the arts, we can help them develop into well-rounded, creative individuals with the confidence to succeed in all areas of their lives.
779;Some people say that modern technology has made shopping today easier, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion;It is commonly argued that the fast pacing technology has helped people do shopping at the present time more easily. However, some people think online shopping is really difficult for them. This essay will consider both the advantages and disadvantages of the use of technology for shopping.One disadvantage of online shopping can be mentioned is that people cannot familiarize themselves with online applications for ordering essential goods and food. In fact, the elderly are not good at technology enough to go to virtual supermarkets. Besides, those who live in remote areas are not accessible easily to technology to buy online groceries.Despite its disadvantage, online shopping has brought about advantages for those who are technology natives. Firstly, it can be time-saving. In fact, shoppers can order any things they need with some clicks on the items, payment method, and time of delivery. Especially in a lingering Covid-19, when social distancing measures have been effective in some places in Viet Nam, according to a survey, the number of online shoppers has been increasing day by day, and thus many applications have been into existence, developed, and thrived.Another advantage of virtual shopping is that it can be life-saving to many people in a pandemic across nations. Going to supermarkets can be detrimental to buyers due to the spread of viruses and the higher risk of infection. For example, in order to buy bread for breakfast, people have to go out for it and thus may be exposed to infectious or incubated victims of Covid-19. Moreover, with preventive measures of Covid-19 containment, such as people not being allowed to go out for their essential goods, if they do not know how to make an online order, it is really difficult for them to survive during a pandemic.In conclusion, the use of technology for virtual shopping is beneficial to our time-saving and life-saving matters, though it is not familiar to some people. In my opinion, thanks to its advantages, I will continue to go shopping online, though the world has gone through the Covid-19 pandemic successfully.; . On the one hand, modern technology has changed the way people shop and made it easier to shop, and the appearance of e-commerce has changed people's habits. People can now browse and buy from home, or even buy them, no matter where they are, at any time of day or night. Mobile phones and digital payment systems have made it easier to pay and reduce the need to use cash and credit cards. On the other hand, some people disagree, pointing out that modern technology has made shopping more difficult. Some people also point out that social media and other platforms have bombarded them with advertisements and promotions that have become too annoying and make the shopping experience more tiring. In addition, there is a lack of human interaction and service, and the feeling of shopping is less intimate and lonely. But the benefits of online shopping, such as convenience, convenience, and flexibility, outweigh the shortcomings. And many companies have begun to use modern technology to enhance their shopping experience, such as using augmented reality to let people virtually try on clothes. In my opinion, modern technology has made shopping easier and more convenient. It has also changed the shopping experience. In general, consumers have more shopping choices, convenience, and flexibility than ever before.
1401;Some people say that the Internet is making the world smaller by bringing people together. To what extent do you agree that the internet is making it easier for people to communicate with one another?;In today’s world due to the advancement of technology new inventions are coming into existence. It is true that ‘Necessity is a mother of invention’. Internet is just like a wonder box, which contains every type of information. it has also proved a very important tool to connect people with one another.In today’s modernized era nobody has sufficient time to write letters to their loved ones. it also takes longer to send or receive any informationthe Internet is the easiest way to send messages to our loved ones. Communication can be either in the form of e-mail or through text messages sent via to mobile phones. We can send and receive messages straight .today’s young generation mostly prefers to do chatting through the Internet. During such chatting we can write messages and get replies straight away. voice chatting is .the advantages and disadvantages resemble two sides of one coin, also some downsides, causing people health problems poor eye-sight, back ache or migraines. Today’s teenagers usually prefer to spend their time on the internet rather than in other physical activities, which causing them to have a weaker physical health.To conclude, I would like to say that the Internet is one of the most modernized and most successful tools, not only for regarding every field in a very short period of time.; In my opinion, I strongly agree that the Internet is making the world smaller, on the one hand, because it provides a platform for people to communicate with each other from all over the world. The development of the Internet has revolutionized the way people communicate with each other. For example, a person in the United States can easily communicate with a person in Japan or Australia, enabling people to maintain ties and friendships around the world, make new friends and even get business opportunities around the world. For example, emails, social media and instant messengers have made it possible for people to communicate with each other across time zones and geographic distances, enabling people to maintain relationships, make new friends and even find business opportunities. On the other hand, the Internet also facilitates communication between people with the same interests and hobbies. For example, on the Internet there are many discussion groups, forums and blogs, which can be used to share ideas, information and projects, so people with similar interests can communicate with each other, no matter where they are. This is one of the most important benefits of Internet communication, and has made the Internet an indispensable tool in people's lives. Besides, the Internet has also made it possible for people to access information and resources from all over the world, and has facilitated the sharing of knowledge and ideas among different cultures. This has made the world a smaller and more connected place. As the Internet develops, its role in the world will only increase and its role will become even more important, and the world will become smaller and more connected.
727;Some people say that the experiences a child has before starting school have the most influence on their future life. Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. Discuss both views and give your own opinion?;There are a lot of research about development in human life, Some people say that the experiences a child has before starting school have the most influence on their future life. Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. In the following paragraph, I will discuss both view and give my opinion.On the one hands, There has a research that bad experience in children before begining at school, especcially in family, will become unforgettable deep heart. For example, Children who live with strict parents and has aggressive punishment when children doing littie wrong things. In the future, Children will tend to aggressive and feeling they has not received a love from family. This research surely reasonnable because family is an important factor of social life.On the other hands, There have an opinion even if children was velvet glove when raised with family. However, Especially in adolescent, Friend and teacher can infleuence as same as family because teenagers spend more time at school that with family as a reason learning in classroom more than primary school and have a more group work with friend. Thus, If teenager prefer to close with a good student (not smoking or drinking alcohol / invite classroom friends travel education museum in weekends or holiday), Parents can make sure that your child will mature to standard adults.In conclusion, In my opinion, Children would be infleuenced by family before begining at school. After that, They will has a lot of complex relationship in school from friends and teachers that can infleuences children. So, Children should try to control yourself in moral to be a best quality adults.; In this essay I will explain both views and give my own opinion. The question of which stage of life has the greatest influence on a person's future life has led to a lot of discussion. In the first place, the child's first years are very important for his future. At home and in family relationships, the child learns the social, emotional and intellectual foundations that will determine his future. The first school years are especially important, because it is a time of intense physical, social and emotional changes for teenagers, and the experiences they have during this time help shape their identity, values and goals. However, it has been shown that early experiences can have a significant impact on the development of the brain and affect the child's future ability to learn. And I think both views are true and it is difficult to find one that is most influential. A teenager who is encouraged to take part in various classes or sports develops important life skills such as cooperation, perseverance and discipline. On the other hand, the relationships with peers and teachers at school can influence their academic achievements, career choice and general well-being. Finally, it is the combination of positive early childhood experiences and good teenage support that can give a person the best start in life. But I think that a child's experiences before starting school are the foundation for success in life, and experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are the opportunity to strengthen the foundation and develop a certain way of life.
337;Some people think history has nothing or little to tell us, but others think that studying the past history can help us better understand the present. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;With the development of technology, an increasing number of people try to acquire the latest technology such as computer programming, rather than to study history. There is a debate whether studying histroy could give us more advantages to understand the present society. In my opinion, obtaining knowledge of past history would be definitely helpful for us to live well in society today. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.To begin with, looking back on history would give us the opportunity to notice mistakes which human beings used to make in the past. Specifically, all kinds of people and countries around the world had made innumerable mistakes throughout history. Besides, some of these mistakes might result in a huge number of victims. Therefore, human beings must avoid these tragedic events happening again. Above all, only knowing history could lead to avoidance of the recurrences. To be more specific, World War must be one of the serious events in human being history, and understanding of this truth have a significant impact on how we should live not to cause war again in the present society. It is manifest that leaning history is meaningful in this regard.On the other hand, some arguments can be made that old stories have little something to do with our present lives. However, closer examination would reveal that all the relationships present today originally come from something in the past. Knowing history enables us to find the best way to a fruitful future. The compelling example of this is racial discrimination in the U.S. Understanding the U.S. history could give us the best manner not to deteriorate relationships in the U.S. I suppose that studying history would be helpful for all human beings from this aspect.Having considered all the arguments above, learning history would be a major contributor to a better understanding of the present because we can know how to avoid the same mistake people used to made and how we should behave for the better result through history.; On the one hand, those who believe that history has nothing to tell us claim that it is a collection of past events that cannot be changed, so focusing on history will divert our attention and energy from the pressing problems of today and the future. On the other hand, those who think that history has little to tell us argue that it is a vital component of our knowledge. History teaches us about the way societies, cultures and governments have changed over time, and the consequences of past actions and decisions. On the other hand, they argue that history is a subjective and interpretive process, which makes it less useful for understanding the present. However, history also preserves cultural traditions and customs and gives us a greater understanding of the views and experiences of other people. It can help us to understand the origins of certain trends in the present. For example, understanding the history of global conflicts can inform our thinking about diplomacy and the formation of government policy. Knowledge of past economic crises can help us to prevent future ones. The past and the present are inextricably linked. We risk repeating past mistakes and failing to learn from the experiences of the past. I believe that studying history is essential to understand the present. Therefore, I think that history has much to tell us and that we should encourage and value the study of it as a means of understanding the complex world in which we live.
411;Some people think students should study the science of food and how to prepare it. Others think that school time should be used in learning important subjects. Discuss both views and give your opinion?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;These days a portion of the society consider that students must learn the subject of cooking food and ways to make meals meanwhile, a group of people think that educational institutions shall be used to study more essential courses. I strongly agree that schools should be used for learning far important subjects rather than cooking classes. In this essay a im going to examin and discuss both phenomenon viewpoints and draw my personal opinion.In one hand, some people think that cooking and food subjects should be an important courses in schools,in addition, the steps of preparing meals and information about food may help students for a healthy lifestyle.On the other hand, a group of individuals consider that cooking is a hobby and cooking classes must be optional to the student and not requiered for all students, to illustrate even more, a bigger portion of students may not be interested in cooking as others,whereas, schools must be used for more serious purposes ,for example, studying more complicated courses will have a positive effect on the students academic outcomes ,meanwhile, adding courses such as cooking might effect the students time manegement and influence their ability to focus on the important things,for further explaination, if they have a test or different assignments deadlines they should be really focusing on that rather than attending cooking classes.In conclustion, and after analysis of both penomenon i presonally believe that cooking classes should not be considered as an essential course for students in educational institutions.; There are some people who think that it is necessary to learn how to cook in order to live an independent and healthy life. The question of the possibility of teaching the science of food and cooking in schools is a controversial issue. Others believe that time should be spent on the study of more important subjects such as math, language and science. I think that students should be taught to cook because they can make healthier dietary decisions for themselves, as they will be able to do this. These people argue that the study of the science of food and cooking can be equated with studying subjects that are more important for the intellectual development of a person. The knowledge of mathematics and science can be an excellent foundation for a career in medicine or engineering. Today, learning to cook can make a significant contribution to the health of students in our world, which is full of various nutritional diseases and food-related diseases. Cooking is also a great way to learn measurements, fractions and other mathematical concepts. In my opinion, both arguments have their own merits, but I still believe that students should be taught to study the science of food and cooking. The school should do this to give a more complete education to its students, so that they could live a healthy, independent and successful life.
59;Some people think that governments should ban dangerous sports, while others think people should have freedom to do any sports or activity. Discuss both views and give your own opinion;From the known history of the humanity, many sports or activities have been done to enjoy ourselfs, keeping in shape, or spent time. Grown up people should be free to do any kind of sports or activities by their will unless they are not hurting anyone else except theirselfs.Some people think when a citizen hurt his/herself, tax payers need to pay for the health care fees, and it should not be consern for the tax payers since they are paying only for fundamental situations. This point of view is not matching with the freedom. Yes, there might be a fee for tax payers, yet freedom should be above on all fees. While some people prefers less dangerous activities, others can be interested in more dangerous activities, as well.Governments can have some precautions to make citizens' life better. Yet, they should not involve such things like banning sports since it is the preference of the people which dealing with the dangerous sports. Some people could want to make more unique or exciting sports, and it is quite natural. Banning such kind of activities can be considered as limiting people's freedom.Since most of the people living together for a quite time in a society, people should pay respect on each others preferences, unless it is not interesting other people's personal area. As a calm and relax person, I am not intend to make dangerous sports or activities. However, I do not think that I have the right or power to say other people what should they do or not, and vice versa.; On the one hand, some people argue that governments have a responsibility to protect their citizens from harm and therefore should ban dangerous sports. This argument is based on the idea that governments have a duty to ensure public safety and prevent unnecessary injuries and deaths. Those who advocate this position also argue that people should be free to choose the activities that they do, even if they are considered dangerous. For example, extreme sports such as surfing, climbing and street luge are dangerous and dangerous and banning them could prevent injuries and deaths. However, in my opinion, governments should not ban dangerous sports. On the one hand, the government should protect its citizens, but it should not ban dangerous sports. Those who argue this point argue that banning dangerous sports would imply a great deal of power on the part of the government, which could hinder the development of these sports. At the end of the day, people should have the freedom to choose the activities that they will participate in, as long as they know the dangers of these activities and take the necessary precautions. Instead, the government could establish stricter rules for the organization of these activities, improve the quality of protection, increase the availability of auxiliary materials and ensure that those who perform them are properly prepared and informed of the dangers. So we can find a middle way between freedom and security. This middle way can allow people to do what they want and at the same time protect them from unnecessary harm.
1325;Some people think that hosting an international sporting event is beneficial for a country, while others disagree. Do the advantages of hosting a major sporting event outweigh its disadvantages?;International sporting events are well-known for attracting a high level of attention because they give many people something to look forward to. Understandably, there are advantages and disadvantages for the host country, and careful consideration is required to determine whether a nation will benefit or lose from hosting a major sports championship.Worryingly, the new infrastructure required for hosting a major sporting event often comes at the expense of local people. Their lives get disrupted by construction works and at times residents have even been evicted from their homes for stadiums to be built. Worse still, practice shows the expensive, gigantic buildings constructed for the sports event aren’t being used afterwards and fall into disrepair, leaving the country with high maintenance bills. The financial burden from hosting the Olympic Games, for example, is staggering and can run into tens of billions. Still, the question remains whether or not the pros outnumber the cons.It is hard to underestimate the amount of influence on the country’s global status and prestige that comes with becoming a home to an international sporting event. New trade opportunities appear on the horizon, as it happened for many countries that hosted the Olympic Games. There is also a welcome increase in tourism, which gives the local economy a boost, injecting billions of dollars into the national budget. Construction of new stadiums, hotels and infrastructure such as new roads and rail links creates new jobs, further improving the country’s economy. Less tangible but still important is the aspect of national pride and the feel-good factor associated with hosting an international sports event.All in all, it seems to me that an international sporting event can bring more good than harm to a country, especially if its potential dangers can be avoided or minimised. Hosting a World Championship is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a country and an immense source of pride for its citizens.; Is there a conflict between them? In this essay, I will analyze both sides of the debate and give my own opinion. On the one hand, the country that hosts the Olympic Games will get a lot of benefits, such as increased tourism, job opportunities and economic growth. At the same time, foreign athletes and visitors will also promote cultural exchanges and enrich the country's unique cultural heritage. On the other hand, there are also some problems to consider. On the one hand, hosting a major sporting event is an expensive project, and many new stadiums, roads and hotels must be built. Moreover, it will make the country more proud of its achievements and promote the spirit of the people. In addition, there will be inconveniences in life, such as traffic congestion and noise pollution. In my opinion, the benefits of hosting a major sporting event outweigh the costs. The government can reduce the costs by using public funds and other measures, so that the country can further develop its economy. In addition, it is also a good opportunity for the country to show off its achievements and lead the world.
575;Some people think that hosting international sports events may be beneficial for a country. Discuss both views.;Certain people believe that organizing international sports competitions could benefit host countries. While hosting sport events might also entail risks, I firmly believe that nations would gain much more than they would lose, as I will explain below.International sport competitions are usually large events that bring together thousands of people including athletes, staff, and tourists. This usually represents an attractive opportunity for local business and investors. People need to be fed, thus activating restaurants' economy. Additionally, they need a place to sleep and rest, which would benefit hotels. On the other hand, many countries hosting international competitions build new infrastructure, including stadiums, pools, public squares, and even airports. It is clear that several cities around the world have developed as a result of hosting such events. Let us take the example of the city Montreal in Canada, which hosted the olympic games a few decades ago. Organizing sports events also represents an opportunitty to improve the international image of a country. For example, it is not a secret that some countries such as Germany and Russia have used the World Cup to improve their international image, with positive results overall. Finally, since inhabitants of the host nation would feel inspired to practice a new sport, we could argue that competitions could additionally improve the health and wellbeing of citizens in the long term.It is important to mention, however, that hosting sport events might also entail some risks. These competitions are usually complex and expensive to organize, and middle- or low-income economies could better use their resources to build vital infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools. Moreover, examples around the world illustrate that some politicians see these events as an opportunity for curruption.In conclusion, there are more benefits than risks for countries when it comes to hosting international sport events. These events might translate into economic opportunities for local business and investors, could bring new infrastructure, and may trigger development.; Certainly, it is true that the country hosting the competition will be able to benefit in many ways from such an event. For example, a significant number of tourists and athletes will come to the country, which will bring in a lot of money into the economy. On the other hand, some people believe that it is not profitable to host international sports competitions. These people argue that the costs of holding these competitions are much higher than the benefits. After all, the construction of sports stadiums and arenas requires huge investments, which subsequently can affect the quality of education and health care. However, after the completion of the competition, it is possible to use these funds for other, more necessary things, for example, for development. And, finally, inconveniences in the organization of the competition, such as the transport gridlock, the increase in security, can be a serious problem. In my opinion, the conclusion is that, although the economic and public benefits of the country are quite significant, it is necessary to weigh these benefits against the costs and social disadvantages. In the end, the decision to host the competition should be taken in favor of the interests of the population.
1017;Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Whilie some people believe that we can live with climate change instead of dealing with that, I don't agree with this idea because climate change can bring various disadvantages for our life.There are many disadvantages of climate change which can gradually push animals and also human to extinction. First and foremost, climate change promote the process of global warming which is one of the most dangerous result of climate change. Because of this situation, ice in 2 polar areas is melting day by day. As a result, the level of sea water will go up. Therefore, countries which are near by the sea may be drown in the future. Another drawback of climate change is that it causes many disaster. The figure for disaster is predicted to increase because of climate change. Hence, people and animals will have to deal with many dangerous disaster which can bring a lot of damage.Beside, I believe there are also many way to prevent climate change. Firstly, from my perspective, education is the best way to deal with the changing of climate. Because education raises the awareness of people about how dangerous climate change is, and it also teach people to protect the environment. Therefore, the effect of climate change will decrease. Secondly, local community should hold more volunteer activity for people to clean the palace where they live, so people can make sense of environmental protection and their neighborhood will also be cleaned. This activity can also contribute to prevent climate changeIn conclusion, I believe that people can't live with climate change and people have to prevent it.;" In my opinion, adapting to the inevitability of climate change is a reasonable approach, especially for the local communities who are suffering from it. On the other hand, I partly agree with the position that we need to adapt to the climate change. But it is important to prevent human life and property from climate change. For example, coastal cities have begun to invest heavily in seawalls and other methods of protecting themselves against floods; countries that are often hit by droughts are introducing new irrigation systems and drought-resistant crops. We must focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and introducing a new energy system based on renewable energy sources, and thus adapt to the inevitably of climate change. On the other hand, I firmly believe that preventing climate change should be our main goal. The consequences of the consequences of climate change without a solution are catastrophic, with mass extinctions, extreme weather events and the most extensive human migration in history. To sum up, I would say that although it is necessary to adapt to climate change and is necessary and must be done as soon as possible, it should not be done at the expense of prevention. Prevention through sustainable practices and policies can make the consequences of climate change more bearable and cheaper in the long run. And it is not a substitute for prevention, but a complementary approach that ensures a sustainable future for everyone."
1341;Some people think that it is fine for professional athletes to misbehave on or off the field, as long as they are playing well (opinion);"Some people think that it is fine for professional sportsmen and sportswomen to misbehave on or off the field, as long as they are playing well.Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Sample EssayAlthough most professional athletes are aware of their position as role models for their fans and behave accordingly, there are sportsmen and sportswomen who behave poorly during matches and in their private life. While some people find it acceptable as long as their performance on the field is not impacted, not everyone agrees with that point of view.Those who put athletes’ performance on the field above everything else point out that competitive environment and immense pressure the sports people are under affect their behavior. They argue that athletes are entitled to privacy and their actions before and after games should not concern the general public. I find this hard to agree with, because poor behavior in sports people is incompatible with their role in public’s life and also for the reason that their actions could negatively affect their entire sports industry.The main reason why I believe athletes should behave well at all times is that their behavior is tremendously influential. Spectators respect players and many copy their actions and behavior; therefore, if top players misbehave or violate laws, some of the fans may feel compelled to follow their example and behave badly. For example, after an acclaimed baseball player was caught using drugs some years ago, the number of people who were arrested for the same crime significantly increased. This shows quite clearly why high profile players should consider their actions very carefully in order to promote a peaceful society.In addition, the behavior of athletes might affect the popularity of their sports. Some companies sponsor successful athletes who boost their brand recognition and sales of their products. Players and sports industry executives are financially compensated for endorsing products and participating in commercial advertisements. If they demonstrate poor behavior, sponsors could direct their money elsewhere, and as a result sports matches could suffer due to lack of funds. To illustrate, Sumo, a traditional Japanese sport, is held every season thanks to resources donated by companies. In a year when a Sumo player was involved in a violent crime, no matches were held, resulting in a large deficit of funds.In conclusion, I completely disagree with the opinion that top athletes are permitted to behave badly because their behavior may negatively influence the public behavior and sports industry itself.Assessor’s comment: This response addresses both sides of the argument by exploring the reasons why some people think athletes are allowed to behave poorly as long as they play well, and the reasons why others think poor behavior has no excuse. This response deserves a high score for task achievement because of that. A good range of cohesive devices is used in this essay; that and the organisation of ideas makes it easy to follow. Sentence structures are varied and the vocabulary is quite rich, the author also showed good control of grammar and spelling. It is worth noting that this sample is longer than the recommended 260 – 285 words, however, this isn’t an issue provided the author can complete an essay of this length and quality in under 40 minutes. Overall this is a good example of a Band 8 essay."; Others argue that this attitude is incorrect and dangerous. In my opinion, the latter view is more relevant. It gives the wrong message that winning is an excuse for misbehavior. They are not only role models, but also ambassadors of their sport, brands and countries, and their actions on and off the field are watched by their fans, the media and a younger generation, who admire and follow them. Also, their misbehavior can have serious consequences for both athletes and society. Athletes may face legal consequences, reputational damage and even loss of support from the public. This not only violates the ethics of sports and the idea of fair play, but also encourages the creation of a culture where ethics and morality are sacrificed for victory. To avoid these negative consequences, professional sports teams, leagues and brands should hold athletes to the highest standards of behavior and ensure that they are responsible for their actions. Also, their behavior can influence their young fans, making it seem more acceptable to them. Moreover, their behavior can affect the atmosphere on the team and the overall reputation of the sport. When we hold athletes to higher standards, we not only preserve the dignity of sports, but also contribute to a society that respects and follows moral and ethical principles. In this way, we are promoting a culture that values both excellence in performance and integrity in character.
1422;Some people think that it is important to use leisure time for activities that develop the mind, such as reading and doing crossword puzzles. Others feel that it is important to give one’s mind a rest in leisure time. Discuss.;As we are human we naturally need to rest leisure time to stress of work and everyday life. In fact, every individual need to do what they want and . Personally, I prefer to be active during this time because . Moreover, people are free what they do their leisure time, and nobody can say what is the best.Some people want to relax after their day of work. These people may prefer to relax by watching movies, reading or getting a massage. People who have a such as doctors, teachers and builders may choose these types of activities. If you are a doctor, you may feel that you want to let your body rest after work and you don’t want to do a five kilometer run after work, because you are already physically tired.On the other hand, some people choose to be active in their leisure time because they do . For example, these people many spend all day sitting on a chair and their work. At the end of a working day, they a backache, and all of their body tired so they need to stretch their arms and improve their health by doing some activity such as going to the gym or swimming.To sum up, the important thing is that people want to stay healthy by choosing what is best for them. In my view, the wrong way is to stay at home in your leisure time if you have a job.; Using leisure time for activities that develop the mind, such as reading and crossword puzzles, can be beneficial to the mind, since these activities not only improve memory and help solve problems, but also widen one’s knowledge and understanding of the world. On the other hand, some people think it is important to use leisure time for activities that give the mind a rest. In a fast-moving, sometimes extremely stressful world, it is important to provide the mind with an opportunity to relax. These activities can be enjoyed and a source of personal satisfaction, leading to a more productive life. Furthermore, relaxation and mental rest can have many health benefits, such as reducing stress, improving mood, and increasing overall well-being. In the end, a balance between mental development and relaxation is necessary for a healthy and productive life. In conclusion, I do not think it is possible to choose between these two activities, but rather to achieve a balance between them, a life in harmony with ourselves. It is important to develop and stimulate the mind, but equally important to provide it with periods of rest and relaxation.
1215;Some people think that it is important to use leisure time for activities that improve the mind, such as reading and doing word puzzles.Other people feel that it is important to rest the mind during leisure time.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.Write at least 250 words.;Leisure period from our everyday busy schedules is absolutely a well cherished time by most people. What should exactly be done during this free time has been the subject of debate for a while. Some would argue that engaging in simple and less brain tasking activities during this time keeps the mind busy,facilitates mental alertness and sanity.While other scholars would argue that keeping the mind relaxed would improve focus and recharge the mind for when needed at work after the free period has waned off.On the one hand, it seems beneficial to engage in activities that keeps the mind slightly engaged during our leisure period. This is basically due to the fact that some mind consciousness might be lost when idle.Sluggishness may thereforeset in when required to partake in activities that requires full attention. Hence playing chess and games might help maintain ones' awareness during a less busy period. Secondly, getting involved in basic activities like reading and surfing the internet during these free period could also help improve ones intellectual capacity and also overall general knowledge that could well be very beneficial to improving the entire state of the mind.On the other hand, those who say its essential to rest the mind after extensive period of activities might have a point.This is because resting the mind will help recharge Ones' batteries and general condition of the mind. Take for instance, a Tech inclined engineer that uses his mind and brain a lot to profer solutions to complex problems. A liitle period to be calm and relaxed will be of utmost importance to alleviate a potential mind and thoughts exhaustion.In conclusion, while it seems very important and beneficial to rest the mind during leisure period to aid rebooting of the mind and brain.I strongly believe that getting involved is some innovative and creative activities during these period improves our general state of health and mind.; The question of how to spend leisure time has always been a topic of debate among people. On the one hand, some people think that leisure time should be spent on reading and doing puzzles because these activities help the brain and make people smarter and more advanced. Others believe that it is best to rest the mind during leisure time and get rid of the fatigue and stress of daily life. Engaging in activities such as reading and solving crossword puzzles can improve memory, help people learn new things, and even delay the onset of the decline that happens with age. However, I believe that there should be a balance between rest and work in order to achieve a good balance between work and leisure. It is because resting the mind reduces anxiety, improves mood, and improves quality of life. I like to read and learn something new every weekend, but I also set aside some time for meditation and relaxation. This way, I can keep my mind in good shape, so that I can be more active and achieve more goals, and I can avoid being too anxious. I believe that in order to achieve a balance between work and leisure, there should be a balance between the two.
865;Some people think that it is more beneficial to take part in sports which are played in teams, like football, while other people think that taking part in individual sports, like tennis or swimming, is better. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Sport play an essential role in shaping the personality of individual. Some people believe that sports which are played in teams are more beneficial like football, while others think that solo sports like tennis or swimming is better. The following essay will discuss both arguments and give my opinion that sports which are played in teams have more advantages over solo sport activites.First of all, there is no doubt that the individual sport activities enahnce people confidence. It helps building the personality and strentghen the mentality of the individuals. For examole, one role model in my home country was playing tennis table, he mentioned once in an interview, that sport helped him not only to win trophies but it raised his mental strength and shaped his pesonality.However, some people believe that, sports which are played in teamshave more advantages and all community will get the benefits. Soccer, for example, will help the players specifically the young children to understand working together and sharing the responsibility. In addition people will grow with better understanding to the concept of sharing achievements which can improve all the community. For instance, i was a member of soccer team in high school, me and my friends were taught, in order to win games we should put plans together and work as one unit. Furthermore, it helps me later in my career to understand the meaning of leadership and how the sharing responsibility and working together could bring the success to our endeavour.To conclude, solo sport can bring proud and honour to individuals butsports which played in teams teach people the meaning of working together which will improve the community in the future.; I would like to discuss both views and express my opinion. The question of whether team sports or individual sports are more beneficial has caused a lot of controversy. For one thing, taking part in a team sport allows an individual to have contact with his peers and to learn to work together, and in the process it develops a sense of belonging and cooperation. Moreover, team sports often require strategy and communication, so they develop people's ability to cope with problems and change. For example, players of football, for instance, must all work together to achieve a common goal. This enables them to work together and rely on each other, and develops a sense of trust and confidence among them. On the other hand, individual sports have their own advantages. They develop a person's mental strength, self-discipline and time management. A tennis player, for example, has to overcome all kinds of obstacles and concentrate on the game, and so he is the only one responsible for his successes and failures. In my opinion, both team sports and individual sports have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on a person's preferences and goals. And so it is up to individuals to choose the kind of sport that suits them best and reap the benefits of physical and mental health. However, I still think that participating in a team sport gives a more complete experience, because it combines physical activity with social contact and teamwork.
765;Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children’s development than playing computer games. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Some individuals believe that playing outside has a more positive effect on children's development rather than playing computer games. I share the idea that being involved in outdoor activities is more beneficial than playing computer games.Active development is the main reason for including outdoor activities in children's life. All people know that the development of children is an extremely significant part of building a personality. To do so parents should try to involve their children in exploring local insects, animals or playing different games such as football, riding bicycles, and many other. This will only expand the knowledge of children, and consequently have a positive effect on their development. This is also important to have a healthy generation in the future. Parents can join their children or they can find some friends around and also be socially active. For example, a father can teach his son how to bicycle or how to take care of plants and trees.The next important reason for doing more outdoor activities for children is avoiding physical problems, which can cause computer games. Currently, a lot of people including children suffer from different side effects of a lazy lifestyle and obesity can exemplify it. To avoid problems with physical health in the future, spending a couple of hours should be recommended to all children.Of course, little time spent playing computer games will not hurt children, but it is important to limit it. To sum up, children should do more outdoor activities and play computer games less.; I agree that outdoor activities like sports, playing in the park or exploring nature offer a wide range of benefits for children's physical, mental and social development. Although there are some advantages of playing computer games, I strongly agree that outdoor activities are better for children's development. Firstly, it is good for the body: physical development, balance and coordination, and in addition to the healthy lifestyle of reducing weight and exercising, the body is exposed to sunlight, which is essential for the formation of bones. Secondly, the sunshine gives children the opportunity to have a healthy life and provide their bodies with the necessary vitamins. Thirdly, it is good for the soul: through contact with other children, a lesson is learned in teamwork, communication and friendship, and these skills are indispensable for building future relationships and future careers. Besides, nature has been proven to reduce stress and improve mood, contributing to better mental health. And finally, socializing with others in the virtual world may expose children to inappropriate content and bullying. In contrast, although playing games on the Internet can improve logical thinking, strategy and reaction speed, it often lacks the holistic benefits of playing outdoors. This is why it is important for parents and educators to encourage children to take part in outdoor activities in order to make them grow into well-developed, healthy and sociable people. In conclusion, although playing computer games has some advantages, the comprehensive benefits of outdoor activities cannot be ignored for children's physical, mental and social development.
613;Some people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;It is often argued out there about sports, debating about both physcial and mental strengths and which is far more crucial to the success. This essay will go over these two points of view in further depth and outline some expamples, where relevant, for each.On one side, some people think that the most important factor to succeeding in sports is the physical strength. Body strength is actually quite indispensable in any sport activity, especially those types of sports that demand a high fitness level and high physical endurance, etc, such as MMA fights, wrestling, football, and so on. All of these require an elevated and advanced charachterestics of one's body. For example, an athlete can not keep up a football match and running around for 90 minutes without a high body endurance, fitness, so on and so forth.On the other hand, the others believe that a powerful mentality and mindset are needed for such success and accomplishment. That is, they believe that one's attitude is the first key to success before anything else. People need to have some sort of a mindset with specific qualities, such as perseverance, determination, concentration, etc. and it's not always about havign a massive body strength. For example, some MMA athletes step in the ring with solid bodies, will not always win the games if they're not determined and persistent already, altought their opponents do not have that huge bodies. It's all about the mindset.In conclusion, it's not easy to decide which of these two criteria is more important than the other. However, I believe that any athlete must have these two, train them both before getting into any challenge, no matter what type of activity. An athlete must have a strong body and a trained attitude once and for all.; We are going to discuss both views and give our own opinion on the matter. Those who think that physical strength is the key to success in sports and those who think that mental strength plays the main role in sports are still arguing. The example of such sports as football, rugby and boxing, which require high physical strength and endurance, is enough. Physical strength is undoubtedly important for success in sports. A strong and healthy body enables an athlete to do his best, endure the hardships of the game and recover from injuries quickly. Mental strength helps an athlete overcome obstacles, to overcome pressure and to remain positive. If the athletes have physical strength, they can achieve success in their sport and overcome their opponents. Mental strength, in my opinion, is more important than physical strength for success in sports. Many successful athletes, such as tennis player Novak Djokovic and golf player Tiger Woods, point to mental strength as the main factor in their success. Mental strength helps athletes to go beyond their physical limits, to overcome fear and anxiety, and to keep up their performance in difficult situations. Physical strength is the basis of sporting performance, and mental strength is what makes the champions.
1349;Some people think that public health in a country can be improved by government making laws regarding nutritious food (agree/disagree).;Some people think that public health within a country can be improved by government making laws regarding nutritious food. Others, however, think that health is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Personal and public health are tightly related to food choices. While some people believe that the government should regulate nutrition to improve public wellness, others argue that it should be people’s decision whether to pursue a healthy diet or not. This essay will discuss both points of view and explain why the authorities should not control the types of food people can buy.Legislators could impose laws concerning nutritious food in an effort to have a healthier population, public health costs. Even if this could be considered a good idea, it would be very quite difficult to implement. To achieve this target, the rulers could impose a levy on unhealthy food options, or reduce their availability on the grocery stores shelves. In Italy, for example, products such as carbonated sugary drinks and chips are heavily taxed. As a result, the sales of these items have decreased. However, if the authorities start to take control of what their citizens can or cannot eat, it may be seen as limitation of freedom.Since personal freedom is an extremely important human right, many people think that they should be responsible for their choices regarding the food and drinks they decide to consume. I agree with this opinion because limiting nutritional options, even if it is done with the best outcome in mind, could consequently create dissatisfaction among the population, which would possibly lead to other public issues such as protests and demonstrations. A better approach could be educating the public about a healthy diet, which would help people make better-informed decisions about the food they consume. Many developed countries around the world employed this strategy and saw public health gains.In conclusion, even though the government is able to control the dietary habits of its population through taxation and restrictions, healthier citizens and reduced public health expenses isn’t the only possible outcome. Limiting personal freedom could result in social unrest and for that reason diet decisions are better to be left up to well-informed individuals.This response achieved the task requirements by discussing whether the government or individuals should be in control of their diet. The ideas are developed and supported by examples, the information is organised in paragraphs, and coherence is maintained throughout the essay. A range of sentences structures and advanced vocabulary is used in this work. Overall, it seems worthy of IELTS Band 8+.; Some reasons why people might think so: one, they can restrict the production and sale of unhealthy foods. In my opinion, I agree that laws regarding nutritious food can have a positive effect on public health. Two, the laws can increase the education and awareness of nutritious food. For example, they can limit the use of salt and sugar in foods, or restrict the sale of foods with saturated fats. This can make food manufacturers produce more nutritious foods and increase the public's access to healthy food. In addition, people should be educated about the importance of a balanced diet and the dangers of eating unhealthy foods. However, some people may think that laws restricting the production and sale of unhealthy foods restrict people's freedoms. The government should have the power to limit these activities. But the benefits of improving public health outweigh the disadvantages. I agree with the above ideas. By promoting a balanced diet and increasing access to nutritious foods, the government can help create a healthy and sustainable society.
1386;Some people think that students who don’t take a break in studies between the high school and the university are at disadvantage compared to students who travel and work after high school before further continuing their education. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, in our competitive world, to succeed, knowledge from school and university is not enough. Therefore, students who study from the school to university get fewer benefits and contribute less too, compared to those who travel or work and get experience and skills . There are two following reasons to support for my opinion. I refer to the group of people who study from school to university as ‘group A’ and the other group – as ‘group B’.Firstly, at school and university, what group A gains is almost entirely theory, theory and theory. Of course, theory is very , however, you can’t do everything with just theory. You must have experience. This is what group A . Although in the third or fourth year at university, group A can be apprentices in some companies, to help them approach their future jobs, they aren’t trained well because of the short time spent working. And the real job is still very strange to them. After graduating, without experience, group A students can’t accomplish their work perfectly. On the other hand, it takes them time and money to keep up with other experienced students and they may be scorned. Therefore, group A students can contribute less than group B who have the two most important things: skills and experience.Secondly, as group A students are contributing less, they surely get less benefit. Moreover, many companies which employ people in group A have to train them from ground-up. These companies take this cost from group A’s salary to reduce the risk of their employees leaving to other companies after being trained. So, less benefits are unavoidable and certain, group B members are more loyal and effective workers. They also have useful experience and skills. Besides, their education is the same as or even higher than that of group A. As the result, group B gets more benefits absolutely.In conclusion, I think a student should travel or work before going to the university. That way, not only will they have basic knowledge but also skills and experience which are useful for them to get a good job and have a brilliant future.; I agree that students who do not take a break in their studies are at a disadvantage compared to those who do. The decision to take a break between high school and university has sparked a debate between students and teachers. Some believe that going straight to university is the best thing, others argue that a gap year can be advantageous. Students who take a gap year often find their real passions during this break, strengthen their self-confidence and become more independent. They also benefit from this time out and are more prepared to enter university with more motivation and energy. On the other hand, those who go straight from high school to university often lack the maturity and self-knowledge that comes from taking a break, and this can lead to poorer decision-making and a higher risk of dropping out. In addition, students who take a gap year often develop important soft skills such as self-discipline, time management, teamwork and solving problems, which are very desirable in the labor market. I strongly believe that a break between high school and university can be a good idea and give students the opportunity to explore their interests and develop important life skills that will give them a better position in the labor market. Academic pressure can also limit creativity and hinder personal development. A break in studies can ultimately lead to more academic success and greater personal satisfaction.
1281;Some people think that the most important thing about being rich is it gives a person the opportunity to help other people.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Helping other people in society is noble goal ,to some people it's a big achievement .However rebuilding personality of individuals and giving them an opportunity to leave an influence in the community is reflecting the genuien humanity .Therefore i agree with notion that rich people who are, in fact have the ability to offer the help for orthers in order to recreate healthy environment for everbody to work in our society .The following essay will illuminate the reason behind my opinion .Regrettably . many people suffer form disadvantages situtaions nowdays like losing jobs or money ,they find themselves have no energy or motive to contiune and to help their families . As a result of that poverty propagates in some society and usually accompany with low level availability of education . Hence to avoid falling into misery, some countries nowdays help non governmenrtal organizations and institutions to give assist to poor communities in a manner to raise education and develop health sector. For instance , Red Cross and Save the children , both organizations offere help and leverage human rebuild personality which no doubt will enrich these communities with several benefits .In spite of green vevet picture that mentioned above , some people think that helping people alone is not enough . However , others believe that no matter how grim or daunting things may seem , if the individual have the courage to move a head , then everything is possible . Nevertheless people can find the motive inside eventhoughlife handed them a toughest time . For example Helen Keller .An American Author , although she born with disability but she could be one of greatest authors in western history .In summary , no doubt that people should have the courage to move a head whether they find help from others or not . However people who can offer the help will make our community live peacefully and bring prosperity to our offsprings .; I agree with this statement, because wealth can be a powerful tool for improving the lives of others. One of the ways that wealth can help is philanthropy. For example, billionaires like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett give a lot of money to charities, in order to eradicate diseases, to improve education, to reduce poverty. In this way, wealth can be used to do good. Wealth also creates jobs and opportunities in underprivileged communities. By investing in businesses and start-ups, people with money create jobs, which then help people to rise to the top and develop. Wealth can also help on a much larger scale, which has a much wider impact than the help that people without money can offer. But it is also important to understand that wealth is not the only way to help others. Many people from different backgrounds and walks of life have contributed to their communities in a variety of ways, through volunteer work, helping the elderly or just being good neighbors. But the opportunity to make a big difference and change something at the bottom of society is probably greater for those who are rich. So, in conclusion, the opportunity to help others is, in my opinion, one of the most important advantages of wealth.
1081;Some people think that there should be strict laws to control the amount of noise a person makes because of the disturbance it causes to people.Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;With the increasing population in cities,noise pollution has been one of the important causes of concern.This essay presents the advantages and disadvantages of the strict laws that are made to control noise pollution.Noise pollution affects different groups of people in various ways.The increasing noise in recent days has led to increasing problems of hearing impairment in people in today's society.Also,the noise pollution has a devastating affects on the heart patients and it has been affecting people who are working and studying in various ways.By implementing strict rules like imposing heavy fines on vehicles honking unnecessarily and filing a case on the noise caused by the public gatherings like rallies,the above problems can be addressed.For example, recent studies have shown that the cities having less noise pollution have been leading better life when compared to those with noise pollution.However,implementing strict laws on noise caused by a person also has some disadvantages.Firstly,different religions have different kinds of festivals which cause a lot of noise.For instance,diwali,one of the most celebrated festivals in India,is celebrated by firing crackers causing a lot of noise is affected by implementing these laws.Secondly,most of the people with religious beliefs will have a bad impact by these rules.To give an example,the prayers in masjids are made with loud noise so that it can reach a large group of people living in the area.To conclude,implemeting strict rules like fines and filing a case on the people causing noise pollution have a good impact on the health of the society and increasing the efficiency of work where as the festivals and the religious centres have a negative impact by these laws.; To start with, the law on noise can have some advantages. It is argued that excessive noise can cause significant disturbance to others, especially in residential areas. Furthermore, it can be useful for people to have a peaceful life. For example, the noise from traffic, building work and music can be harmful to health, causing problems such as hearing loss and stress. However, the disadvantages of such laws should also be considered. Noise can also affect the individual freedom and creativity of people. For example, people like musicians and music schools can be limited in their practice and public performance, and this will limit their artistic creativity. I think there should be a balance between the needs of society and individual freedom. This can lead to unnecessary conflicts between neighbors or with the police. Finally, a middle course between the individual's rights and the common good can be a good solution to the problem. For example, the definition of a quiet time and a noise-free area can be a practical solution.
1431;Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than with a teacher. Others think that it is always better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.;It is certainly said that learning is an ongoing process .Every person something new their age, experience, knowledge and education. According to my point of view it is always better to have teacher or guide for study.One teacher has adequate knowledge to teach their student. knows ways to make subject easier for the students, moreover, he teaches them in an effective manner. For example, some students are weak in some subjects but a teacher them according to their mental capacity. . Some people can learn better in the topics with others. In class people can the views of others, . .In the today’s competitive world, everybody is busy, some people think that their time classes they can learn better their subject . They can attend online classes by using the Internet at home. They can get relevant information from the Internet regarding their topic. There is specific time or age limit to learn something new. Some new things we can only learn from experience – for example new facts, new habits and so on., I would like to say that it is always better for the people to have a teacher because a teacher has good knowledge, experience and is educated how to teach others. People will learn from a teacher in an easier way rather than on their own.; This is what I think. I prefer to have a teacher because it is for my advantage. The argument about whether it is better to have a teacher or to learn without one has been the subject of great discussion. When you are alone, it is difficult to see mistakes and you can develop bad habits. On the other hand, a teacher can help us in time and make us do it right. First, the teacher gives individual guidance and this is important for correcting mistakes and improving understanding. Another advantage of having a teacher is the opportunity to have active lessons. With the help of dialogues, debates and practical work, teachers can make complex ideas more accessible and pleasant. The teaching method is adjusted to the needs and abilities of the student, so that the teaching is more effective. In contrast, learning by yourself can be a solitary and isolated activity, without the emotional and moral support that the teacher gives. When you are alone, it is difficult to motivate yourself and be productive, so you can't be as productive as you can when you have a teacher. This social part of learning also develops your critical thinking, problem solving and communication skills, which are necessary for academic and professional success. There are a number of reasons why I think learning with a teacher is better than learning by yourself. First, individual guidance, active lessons and emotional support make learning more interesting, effective and enjoyable. Secondly, teachers give valuable recommendations to further learning, allowing the student to explore new interests and go deeper into the subject. So it is clear that the benefits of having a teacher far outweigh the benefits of learning alone, and for a better education it is best to have a teacher.
693;Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Space, so unknown for the humankind that it generates so much curiosity among experts and enterprenues. Due to this curiosity, the amount of resources and money invested in its exploration is surprisingly big. Developing technology for it is expensive but, in my humble opinion, completly justified.Firstly, developing technology is vital so that space exploration can be carried out succesfully. Experts have discovered that we only know a 4 percent of the entire universe. If with only that 4 percent we have accomplished amazing achievements, imagine what the human race could do when knowing a 10 percent.Secondly, space exploration and the technology involve on it not only will help the human race understand the universe but also will provide a whole new kind of tourism, space tourism. The CEOs of some of the most profitable business in America are investigating this possibility. The leading enterprises in this sector are Blue Origin from Jeff Bezos and Space X from Elon Musk. When discovered the way of sending people to space safely, space tourism will generate twice the money spent on technology for space exploration.In a nutshell, space exploration is crutial for the development of the human race. Furthermore, if this was not enough, all the technology developed will serve the purpose of creating a whole new kind of tourism that will generate billions of dollars in revenue. From my point of view, even though here on earth there are several problems to be solve with money, our future lies on space, so be must spend as much money as possible.; Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. I partly disagree with this statement. The distribution of money for space exploration has been a topic of debate for a long time. On the one hand, I believe that the benefits of space exploration far outweigh the costs. Space exploration has brought about many inventions and innovations that have improved our daily lives, such as GPS, telecommunications and medical technology. The amount of money spent on space exploration could be used to address these issues, which have a more immediate and concrete impact on people's lives. But space exploration can also give us a better understanding of the universe and our place in it, and thus lead to new scientific discoveries and a greater understanding of the cosmos. On the other hand, space exploration can also lead to new discoveries, such as mineral resources and energy, which can also have a major impact on the world economy. With the discovery of new resources and scientific discoveries, it can have a major impact on people's lives and on the environment. For example, satellite technology can be used to monitor the climate and monitor natural disasters, and space-based solar energy can be a clean and sustainable source of energy. In conclusion, I agree that there are more pressing issues on earth, but I think that the benefits of space exploration justify the costs.
1309;Some people today believe that it is acceptable to use physical force to discipline children, but others feel it is completely unacceptable.Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Punishing children with physical force, or corporal punishment as it is also called, is something that was accepted not so long ago and people over the age of forty may well remember it. Nowadays, however, corporal punishment is against the law in most countries and adults who practise it can be taken to court. Children are always a vulnerable group and they depend on adults for protection and education. Of course, part of the growing up process is testing and breaking boundaries and it is nearly always necessary to instill discipline on a child. Whether or not it is necessary to use physical force to do so can be a very emotive subject.Supporters of corporal punishment often defend their standpoint by explaining that the corporal punishment is not, or should not be, excessive. They do not argue that a child should be beaten severely until he or she is bruised or cut. They argue that just the infliction of mild pain causes effective discipline and also the fear that it might be applied. People who grew up experiencing it might offer this point of view.Those who oppose using physical force on a child would say that the vulnerability and innocence of a child means that force should never be used. Children need to trust adults and believe that no harm will come to them. Additionally, children learn from adults and it is argued that corporal punishment will only teach children that force is an answer to various problems. It is also claimed that corporal punishment has no added benefits over other forms of discipline that do not require physical force. Using it can cause psychological harm to children and should be classed as child abuse.Personally, I do not believe that limited use of forms of corporal punishment can cause harm, and a parent who administers a mild form of it to his or her child should not be subject to criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, I would not use it myself. I can also recognise the possibilities of adults who are not a child’s parents misusing corporal punishment. Therefore, I believe that on balance physical force to discipline children should not be permitted.; In my opinion, physical force is unacceptable as a way of disciplining children, and I will explain why I think so. Firstly, physical violence can lead to physical and emotional harm to children. A child who has been hit by his parents may be afraid of him, and this fear can make the child feel guilty about his behavior. This, in turn, can lead to a vicious circle in which the child himself may be subject to violence as a way of resolving conflicts. Secondly, physical violence can have long-term effects on children. A child who has been hit by his parents may later feel anxious, depressed, or violent. He can learn self-control and make better decisions in life when he is not subject to physical force. Thirdly, physical force is not an effective long-term way of disciplining children. Even if it stops their bad behavior, they will not learn why their behavior was wrong or how to improve it in the future. For example, taking away a child's privileges and rewarding good behavior can teach him about limits and consequences without harming him. Finally, there are more effective ways of disciplining children than using physical force. We should, as a society, place children's well-being and safety above all else and encourage positive, non-violent methods of discipline. To sum up, although some people may consider physical force an acceptable way of disciplining children, I do not agree with this opinion.
1358;Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems, is this a positive or negative development?;Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems. Is it a positive or negative development? Give your own opinion and examples from your experience.At present, the Internet plays a vital role in almost every aspect of human life. As a result, individuals are searching online reasonable solutions to their illnesses. Not everyone is convinced that access to such information online is safe and helpful. However, in my view, providing the general public with access to trustworthy information about medical disorders would invariably improve the quality of the medical care for the whole society.Nowadays, even though there are plenty of online platforms developed for medical education, most of the sites have not been written by professional healthcare providers. Hence, there is a high possibility of spreading wrong medical information throughout the world, unless the site developers are held accountable for the content they provide. If patients receive incorrect information about a medical procedure and follow the wrong advice, for instance, to remove a wart at home, it might lead to a serious infection, excessive bleeding or another medical emergency. That would constitute a negative effect of using online knowledge for medical treatments at home rather than visiting a professional.On the flip side, the Internet, the society is well aware of most common medical disorders and preventive measures. Consequently, a reasonable and prudent individual can decide whether to get professional opinion on one’s disease or to handle it at home, that they get reliable online medical information. Moreover, if patients can manage mild medical problems themselves, it would certainly reduce the workload at the local hospitals, freeing more doctors for patients in real need. Besides, if patients come with a certain extent of knowledge about their condition to the medical consultation, it would invariably be helpful to the medical practitioner for effective decision making.To sum up, it is evident that online search for information on medical disorders can be a positive development as long as the general public receives trustworthy information.This response addresses the topic well. The writer’s position is clearly explained and supported, the information is organised in paragraphs in an easy to follow way, and use of linking words is appropriate. A range of complex sentence forms is used and there are very few errors in word choice or word formation (underlined in blue). Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.; This development has both positive and negative sides. On the one hand, the Internet offers unparalleled access to a vast array of medical information, which makes it possible for patients to be more involved in their own treatment. Moreover, it improves the quality of medical care, since it can facilitate communication between patients and doctors. But at the same time, there are many disadvantages of using the Internet for medical solutions. Misinformation is widely available on the Internet, and it is difficult for an untrained person to discern reliable medical information from misleading information. So if you do not have proper medical training, you can easily make a mistake in your diagnosis and self-medication, which can result in a serious health problem. Moreover, if you have been diagnosed incorrectly, it is difficult to distinguish between a disease and a symptom, which means that the results of your treatment may not be the best. In conclusion, the Internet can be a useful tool in the study of medical problems, but if it is used as a primary source for medical solutions, it has both positive and negative sides. On the one hand, diagnosis and treatment on the Internet can never replace the careful, individualized care that health care professionals provide through a thorough medical history, a physical examination and the interpretation of diagnostic tests. Nevertheless, the benefits of medical research on the Internet can be maximized and the disadvantages minimized. In this way, the benefits of Internet research on medical problems can be exploited to the fullest extent.
949;Some say that because many people are living much longer, the age at which people retire from work should be raised considerably.To what extent do you agree or disagree?;People nowadays are living much longer.With the discovering of new medicine and with the innovation in the medical field, the life expectancy of a person skyrocketed over the last decade.Some people might think that the consequence of this phenomenon should be the fact that the age at which people retire from work ought to be raised considerably.I don't agree with this idea.Rather than involving the life expectancy of a person, we should consider the job itself.Is it tiring? Does it require a person to be able to react immediately to a potential problem?If the job is tiring I think that it would be better for a person to retire. If you end up being worn out every day because your job is very exhausting the life expectancy should not be the fact that decides if you have or not the right to retire.The question ought to be: Is the person physically and mentally able to cope with the work?The older you get the slower you become. This is another pivotal factor that should be taken into account when deciding the retirement age of a person.The ability to react to dangerous events keeps the working environment under control.Let's imagine a carpenter working on the construction of a new building.What if a wall suddenly falls? Does an elderly person react faster than a younger worker?I am an optimistic person but I would stick to my guns in this scenario betting on the younger person.I would like to wrap up this essay by saying that I could have thought of many more reasons that explain why the age at which people retire from work should not be based entirely on the fact that people are living longer.Of course, this can not be ignored but basing this decision only on this fact it is seen by me as a poor approach.; In my opinion, I agree to a certain extent that the retirement age should be raised, but there are some conditions. The notion that the retirement age should be raised considerably because of the lengthening of human life has been a matter of much dispute. While some claim that this is a necessary measure to ensure the viability of pension systems, others claim that it is unfair to force people to work longer. By increasing the retirement age, the average length of time people receive pensions and social benefits will be shortened, thus reducing the burden on the budget. On the one hand, raising the retirement age can make a significant contribution to the viability of pension systems and social insurance. On the other hand, I disagree that the retirement age should be raised considerably for everyone. Older workers have a lot of experience and knowledge to offer, which will benefit both businesses and the economy as a whole. As a result, it is not fair or practical to raise the retirement age for everyone. In addition, some people have to take care of their parents and other family members and are therefore unable to work beyond a certain age. Thus, I believe it would be more equitable to establish a more flexible retirement age, to allow people to choose the time of their retirement based on their health, their personal financial situation and their personal goals.
1389;Some say that the Internet is making the world smaller by bringing people together. To what extent do to you agree that the Internet is making it easier for people to communicate with one another?;"A global village, that is certainly what the world feels like nowadays. With the help of the , you can reach out and get to know people you might never have met in person. Articles can be co-authored, business deals can be finalized, degrees can be earned and at times even medical advice can be given- and all of this is just a click away.Electronic mail, instant messages, web cameras and microphones; all these gadgets and programs make the presence of the other person more real. Who knows; with the help of visual reality you might even get a 3-D image of the speaker! I believe that the Internet is one the best inventions of the last century, you can hardly get to miss anyone and nobody is really out of reach. You can keep in touch with your friends, and be able to do your work from your bedroom in your pajamas!However, the internet can also be a major source of harassment. Spammers and hackers can invade your privacy and get personal/confidential information, which otherwise they never get access to. You are never out of anybody’s reach, unless you make a conscious decision of not checking your email, there can be always more work waiting for you in your inbox and you might never have a moment to yourself. Worse yet, if you were a workaholic, you might never experience that stress-free vacation ever again in your life – simply, because you have your mobile workplace with you at all times.As a romantic, I will always look forward to getting an occasional letter in the snail mail. A personal letter, where I can sense the mood of the writer by the slants in his/her handwriting and get to know him/her better. But as a type A personality person, the internet gives me all what I dream of in terms of communication – the speed, reliability, and convenience of time and place. I can certainly tolerate its shortcomings any day, as long as it keeps me close to my loved ones."; In my opinion, I think the Internet makes it easier for people to communicate and makes the world smaller. The Internet has the power to connect people from different countries, and it has a good effect on human life. On the Internet, people can exchange information, share ideas and experiences, and learn from different cultures. Through social media and various video conferencing tools, people can communicate with each other in real time and become friends, partners and business partners from all over the world. This is especially good for people with disabilities and people in remote areas. They can communicate with others without the need to travel far. Moreover, the Internet makes communication easier and more convenient. It's a good thing. The disadvantage of the Internet is that it makes people feel closer than they really are. But this is a kind of progress. In conclusion, the Internet has changed the way we communicate, and its role in making the world smaller is undoubtedly irreversible.
655;Some systems require students to specialize in a limited range of subjects from the age of fifteen. Other systems require students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?;"Education programs are different from one area to another area, there are systems that learners are required to choose restricted number of courses for their academic curriculum by the age of 15.while,other educational systems ask students to take comprehensive courses until they graduate from school. There are many positives for both trends, in my opinion limited range of academic subjects education system is better.On the one hand, it is basic knowledge to accept the idea that pupils who study selected number of subjects from age of fifteen are more informative academically in specified field of study. For example, when student decide to take medical subjects from early age the student will be prepared by tutors completely for the nominated curriculum,as a result all the student's focus will be on medical topics thus, the student is more qualified to practice medicine more efficiently after school graduation.Furthermore, this system will build a solid knowledge background in limited range of subjects can help to develop creativity at early age.Moreover, in the financial view point it may be better for students to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15; selected number of academic subjects means less money allocated for educational services by guardians.On the other hand, it is true to claim that general subjects system can prepare students to be more informative in various different live aspects. Since, students who register with wide range subjects system can gain academic knowledge and support in fields such as mathematics,physics,medicine,and....ect. Therefore,those students can select more than one speciality to practice as a professionalism in future.Besides, wide range system help to improve social interactions better,because friends will not be separated and they continue school education together until graduation,inaddition there is chance to make more friends as primises are more crowded.To sum up, educational systems main target is to develop and progress academic background of students.But, in my opinion,it is better to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15 due to reasons like: solid academic background in specific field,creativity,and less financial burden on parents."; Both have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on the goals and values of the education system. There is a lot of debate about the best education system, and there are also strong arguments on both sides. Students who have a clear idea of their future career can be focused on developing the skills they need. The second system is the most economical, because the students will not waste time studying the subjects that are not useful to them in the future. Students can use the broad education system to explore and understand the various fields, so that they can develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In addition, it can help them gradually find their own interests and talents, and develop their own interests. In general, I think the two systems should be combined to achieve the best results, so that students can be enriched and can meet the requirements of an increasingly complex society. However, in the end, the choice of education system should be based on the needs of individual students and the value system of the society.
1347;Some think that children should leave their family home as soon as possible while others believe they should stay for as long as they like (discuss);Some people think that it is best to encourage children to leave their family home as soon as possible. Others believe children should stay at the family home for as long as they like. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayAlthough it is thought by some that urging young people to abandon their family home at an early age is beneficial for them, others believe that it is better if children stay with their families for longer. In my opinion, leaving family home early has many advantages for children.On the one people think that youngsters ought to leave their parents’ house so as to learn life skills at an early age. Their reasoning is that it should push young people towards independence and make them learn from life lessons rather than merely rely on their parents. For example, students who pursue tertiary study away from their home city might learn taking personal responsibility. Also, living independently will teach children a lot by presenting some difficulties, which, consequently, will add some more experience that may prove essential in their future lives.On the other hand, it is argued that children should stay with their parents for longer for several reasons. Firstly, young people need advice from adults, and no one would be better suited to that than their parents. Secondly, life can be generally harsh, for children in particular. In other words, they might or take unnecessary risks if they mix with the wrong crowd. It is commonly known that young people tend to be by unethical people. To avoid that, being under parental supervision is utterly important for children.To sum up, while people’s opinions may vary, I believe that young people should leave their family home at an early age, while parents ought to provide them with appropriate advice and keep an eye on their well-being.This essay covers the task by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of leaving the family home early in life, and the writer’s opinion has been clearly stated. The arguments for and against have been organised in paragraphs and supported by examples. Accuracy of expression needs some work (see suggested corrections underlined in blue) and in one case sentence structure needs more attention. Overall, assuming the errors were corrected, this essay could score Band 8 in IELTS.; I will discuss these two points of view and present my view. The question of when children should leave their parents’ home has aroused much discussion. In my opinion, leaving home as soon as possible can bring many benefits to children. When children leave their parents’ home, they can learn to live on their own, how to manage money, how to cook and clean, and they can grow into independent and confident people. However, staying at home for as long as they wish can give children security, comfort and guidance. Children can develop their own interests, make new friends and establish their own identity. Some children are ready to leave home at eighteen, but others need more time to mature and learn important life skills. Besides, parents can still guide their children’s lives and help them face the challenges of growing up. And their children can develop a close, loving relationship with their family. In my opinion, the best solution is for parents and children to discuss the issue honestly and decide what is best for everyone together.
1333;Some think that young people should be free to choose any career they like, while others say that they should think more realistically about their future. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;"Choosing a future career requires careful consideration. While some people claim that adolescents should be able to pursue a career they would enjoy, others oppose to that, arguing that teenagers should aim for a high-paying job in order to secure a livelihood when they grow up. Given that our life consists of more than just physiological needs, I strongly believe that it is vital to fulfill one’s potential in the career fields that are most compatible with their interests.The youth who choose highly skilled jobs may find it easier to have a fruitful future in a materialistic sense. It is true that some professions, such as engineers or doctors, are well paid and offer more stability compared to work in other, non-professional fields. For example, psychologists usually have higher starting salaries compared to artists; they also rarely lose their jobs in recessions. People who prioritise earning a living might agree that a reliable job is a must for their future and by no means will they take risks to gain employment in a field they are passionate about, that doesn’t pay well.However, it is worth remembering that we are living in a rapidly changing world and the concept of a ‘guaranteed future’ is unrealistic. Even the smartest of us aren’t prophets and it is impossible to foresee many changes in job markets in the future; some high-salaried jobs of today may no longer exist by the time our young people become adults. Therefore, people may choose to pursue their dreams and follow career paths according to their passions and interests now, to avoid having regrets later in life.Having considered the reasons to prefer monetary remuneration over one’s interests, I am convinced that it would be a pity for youths to limit their career choices to highly paid jobs of today. Unforeseen changes in the jobs markets may affect salaries but won’t change the pleasure one derives from doing something they love."; This issue has become a hot debate. On the one hand, some people argue that young people should be free to choose whatever career they want and are free from pressure and constraint. This argument stresses the importance of personal passion and interest in choosing a career. Some argue that this will result in greater job satisfaction. Some argue that young people should be free to choose their own career. According to them, young people should be allowed to pursue their dreams. This will lead to greater job satisfaction, creativity and innovation. Besides, people who love their work will be more inclined to achieve excellence and make a contribution to their field. On the other hand, some argue that young people should be more realistic about their future and they should think more seriously about their career. According to them, young people should think about the future before they choose their careers. If you allow young people to follow their dreams, they can achieve greater job satisfaction, creativity and innovation. This view stresses the importance of considering job security, salary and career prospects, which are particularly important in today's highly competitive job market. Some people think that young people should be realistic about their future and think carefully about their career before they choose their career. But I think this is important, but young people should be free to choose their own career. According to this view, passion and interest are important motivators for people to succeed in their work, and pursuing a career they love will make their life more meaningful and full of passion. At the same time, they should be aware of the reality of their career and make a reasonable choice.
1403;Students from rural areas often find it difficult to access university education. Some people think that it should become easier for them to study at universities. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Nowadays, it is acknowledged that students from suburban areas find it tough to receive higher education. Whether it should be made easier for them to access university education becomes an ongoing concern, which incurs a highly-charged debate.Obviously, higher education opportunities bring about benefits to students in multiple ways. For example, higher education becomes increasingly important to senior high school graduates, partly it determines if they have the competitive edge in the job market, and partly because it is seen as a guarantee of a certain level of the mental ability, from the computer literacy that is required by the most employers to the capacities of acquiring new knowledge the soonest possible which is valued by most . With a university degree, students from rural areas obtain a job easily, thereby bettering their living conditions and their family as well.Higher education also, however, to impose a heavy burden on families since the rise in the tuition fees are increasingly beyond those families’ ability to afford. In addition, with the mounting evidence, a university degree is not always a guarantee of seizing a decent job; therefore, their living conditions are likely to able to earn back their tuition fee after graduation. people argue, students from rural areas are not well-advised to pursue a university degree. But I perceive their desire to further their education should not be disrespected and the government should subsidise them to receive higher education.In conclusion, university education should be made fair to everyone, predicated only on their academic performance and mental abilities, rather than their financial capacities and the government should subsidise those students in need.Teacher’s comment: Not all the parts of the task were covered. The writer’s position is relevant to task prompt, the main ideas are also relevant but not all of them are developed well enough. The information is presented coherently, it is evident that the writer progresses from one idea to another."; On the one hand, the lack of material and technical resources and means for the competition with urban students is the reason for the difficult access of rural students to university education. In my opinion, I am strongly in favor of making it easier for them to study at universities. On the other hand, it can bring about many positive changes. Poorly equipped schools, a shortage of experienced teachers and a lack of teaching material all hinder the access of rural students to university education. Besides, the cost of moving to a university in the city is too high for many of them, and therefore the disparity between urban and rural students is too great. Furthermore, they are less likely to come back to their hometowns to develop them after they graduate, and therefore it is difficult to close the gap between urban and rural development and promote economic and social development. It is therefore necessary to make it easier for them to study at university, so that the students from the countryside can participate in university life. In this way, it can also promote the convergence of the interests of rural and urban intellectuals, and further encourage the potential of rural intellectuals. There are many ways to make it easier for them to enter university, such as giving them financial support, giving them free or low-cost tuition, and collaborating with schools in remote areas to enrich their teaching resources, and making the requirements for university entry more flexible, considering the difficulties they face. In short, I firmly believe that it is necessary to make university education easier for students from remote areas, and through joint efforts to help them, their hometowns and the whole society will benefit.
809;The Internet is now used all around the world as a source of information and communication. However, it's often controversial, so many people think it needs to be controlled. Others believe there should be no interference whatsoever.Discuss both points of view, and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The Internet has recently become the most widely spread means of communication and knowledge sharing. It is argued by many if any restrictions should be imposed on it. This essay will discuss both views and explain why the Internet should be free from regulations.One group of people consider that the Internet was developed to overcome a government censure, thus any restrictions will destroy its purpose. Despite the fact that there were independent media, it was practically difficult to share news internally and internationally because of low speed of communication methods such as telegraph or post, which lead to the fact that the most common source of information was government authorities who selected the information they wanted to share. Thus, general citizens’ opinion, views and problems were often unheard. This essay agrees that the ability of sharing information freely between people all over the world makes the government to be transparent as everyone’s opinion and problem may be heard. For example, the problems with extinction of wild animals in Baikal region of Russia due to forest cuts was heard only after a massive attack by the media and local citizens and bloggers that would be impossible without the Internet.The others insist that the Internet allows to people share not only useful knowledge, problems and new, but also violent content. The supporters of the view believe that having an easy access to such content, for example assault, production of bombs, people become prompt to criminal behaviour. Although, the Internet makes the violent information more available, the essay suggests that if an individual want to find violent information, he would do it even in the absence of the Internet. Moreover, recent researches conducted by criminalists uncovered that the increase in the number of criminal offenses is not directly correlated with Internet coverage.In conclusion, although the Internet contains violent content, if needed it may be accessed by interested people from other sources of informations, meanwhile independent flow of information allows individuals to attract attention to their local and even global problems which may be hidden by governments without free Internet.; On the one hand, the unregulated nature of the Internet has given rise to concerns about the spread of misinformation, cyber-crime, and the exploitation of vulnerable people, especially children. On the other hand, the argument for control comes from the desire to protect children and vulnerable people from misinformation and criminal activity. The Internet must be regulated for the sake of public safety and the freedom of users. In other words, strict control is necessary for a state like China to maintain national security. In the Arab Spring, for example, the Internet played a key role in the organization of the protests and the dissemination of information, demonstrating its potential as a tool for democracy and social change. On the other hand, those who oppose the control believe that the Internet is a tool for free exchange of ideas, inventions, and new developments. It is in my view that a balance between these two points of view is most sensible. Control of the Internet is necessary to protect vulnerable people from criminality, but over-regulation could restrict the potential of the Internet as a tool for change. A careful balance must be found between the two so that the free flow of information is not restricted but vulnerable people are still protected.
1397;The Internet when used as a source of information, has more drawbacks than advantages. To what extent do you agree with this statement?;Some people believe that internet access creates problems. There are several possible reasons why it can happen.Firstly, some data may be unverifiable. For example, they search for a data, there would be lots of choices that would appear on the screen. They would not be sure if the information they are reading is accurate. Some sources may even have outdated . Secondly, some sites may be unreliable. For instance, people sign up on one site that sells goods online. The goods would be paid for by a credit card, but the purchaser would not receive anything. And finally, not everything is available through the net. When my friend had tried to research for some pictures of 18th century paintings, he did not find any results. Then he was told by his teacher that they would only be available in the library.Others believe that the Internet is very useful and these are the justifications. Firstly, it is hard to get the same data, that is available through the Internet by other means. For example, if the directory information could not give me the accurate address and contact number of a place I to visit, I normally check that information on the Internet. In just one click, I would get all the details of that company. Secondly, research becomes more comprehensive. For instance, I do not have to buy lots of reading materials to complete my research. Most of the needed information can be found if I have Internet access. And finally, data is easily compared and contrasted. researched a study about overweight children a decade ago and at presentwas able to finish his research in just one day, as compared to a week if he would not use the Internet.In conclusion, let me reiterate that the Internet plays a big role in our life, because it makes data retrieval and comparison easier.; As a source of information, the Internet has a lot of disadvantages. However, this statement has been under debate for some time. I will try to discuss the two views on this subject. On the one hand, the Internet provides unparalleled access to a huge amount of information that can be retrieved at an unprecedented speed, which has greatly improved the research, education and communication of people all over the world. Moreover, the Internet democratizes the information, making it possible for people to share various opinions and ideas. On the other hand, the Internet is also a source of misinformation, disinformation and fake news that have serious consequences. The advantages of using the Internet as a source of information are undoubtedly undeniable, as the Internet has opened up new learning opportunities, improved cooperation and contributed to innovation. The disadvantages of using the Internet as a source of information are incalculable. First, the Internet, as a medium, allows hate speech, propaganda and other harmful information to be widely spread. Secondly, using the Internet excessively can cause distractions, shorten the attention span and weaken critical thinking. Generally speaking, the advantages and disadvantages of the Internet can be fully utilized only when it is used properly and consciously. The Internet has become a tool that is constantly being developed, and it can be said that the Internet is a very important source of information.
628;The Pie chart gives information about the country of birth of people living in Australia and the table shows where people born in these countries live.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The pie chart illustrates the percentage of Australia's population by country of birth namely: Australia, UK, New Zealand, China , Netherlands and other nations. While the table represents the percentage in where this people live in.Overall, Australian born comprises most of the country's population. With regards to the type of area they dwel in, most of them live in a city than the rural area.To begin, Australian nationalities has the highest percentage of 73%. Followed by other nation with 14%, taking up about one fourth of the population. While UK's percentage is half the former. In addition, New Zealand, China and Nertherland has a percentage of 3%, 2% and 1% respectively.With regards to the table, amongst the five, Chinese race has 99% of their people living in the city. Also, the rest has a percentage of Netherlands (90%), UK(89%), Australia (83%), and New Zealand (80%). While the remainder of the people live in the countryside, with New zealand having the most population with 20% and China being the least with 1%.; The Pie chart shows that a large proportion of the people living in Australia were born in this country, about seventy per cent. The other thirty per cent were born in other countries, with the largest group from the UK, New Zealand and China. The table shows where the countries of origin of people living in Australia are located. And as can be seen from the table, the people from the UK live mainly in New South Wales, those from New Zealand mostly in Queensland and those from China in New South Wales and Victoria. These figures also show that people from similar geographical areas live in the same parts of the country. For example, people from Asian countries such as China and India live mainly in New South Wales and Victoria. On the other hand, those from New Zealand seem to prefer to live in Queensland. The data shows that the most widely dispersed migrant population is in New South Wales. All this information is of considerable interest for those responsible for providing services to Australia’s multicultural population.
109;The advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's life, English is one of the biggest common language in the world. It is often argued that the benefits of learning English as a global language will superior to its drawbacks continueously. I completely agree with this idea due to the fact that English is one of the easiest language to learn and most education system in the world involve English as one of the courses.English should be continue to use as a global langauge because it is easy to learn. Each language in the world involves different movings of the tongue in the mouth, but some of the languages have similar tongue positions with English, such as Italian, Spanish and French. It will be difficult for people in the world to start adapting a new language and using completely different tongue positions. For example, chinese, one of the most challengeable langauge in the world, it mostly does not need the support of the tongue to touch the teeth or anything else. It is hard for people with other mother language to adapt the pronounciation. Therefore, one of the biggest advantages of English as a common language is the easyness of it.In addition to the easyness of English, numorous education systems in the world include English as one of the important subjects to learn support the benefits of English that will continue to overseed its disadvantages. Since English as one of the spreading languages in the world lasts for many years. A lots of generations learn English since their childhood and English already take a huge part of their educational studies. It is hard for people to abandon this language and step out of their comfort zone. For instance, one of my best chilldhood friend learn English for almost 6 years, but since she went to Spain for two years as exchange students, she get used to the way of learn English, instead of Spanish, so she fell her grade there. It is clear that English as one of the essential courses in world, it has an important connection with the education system globally and it has a huge influence in our studies.In conclusion, the easyness of learning English and the crucial role of it in the educations system support my opinion that I completely believe that the advantages of spreading English as an important language in the world will keep outweigh its flaws.; To some extent I agree that the advantages of English as a global language outweigh its disadvantages. English as a global language has been a widely discussed topic in recent years. It is also the language that people from different countries use to communicate and understand each other, bringing people together and increasing international cooperation. English has become the world's language for communication and international trade, and people from different countries use it to communicate, thereby enhancing the understanding and unity of mankind. In addition, learning English may cause a person to neglect the mother tongue, which may also reduce his or her cultural identity. On the other hand, there are also many disadvantages of the spread of English as a global language. Because English has been widely used, some minority languages have declined, and there is homogenization in cultural and linguistic practices, thereby threatening the diversity of language and culture. Also, people with a good command of English are able to enjoy a higher level of education and employment opportunities. It is necessary to find a balance between the use of English as a global language and the protection of minority languages and cultural diversity. Finally, it is necessary to adopt a more comprehensive view of English as a world language to reduce its disadvantages and increase its benefits. It should encourage linguistic diversity and pay attention to language education.
248;The bar chart below describes some changes about the percentage of people were born in Australia and who were born outside Australia living in urban, rural and town between 1995 and 2010.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;this above bar chart it is depicts the percent flock of people born in Australia otherwise people was born outside , it is clarify from the graph that we leer the a several of bars will making comparsing between them , according what is elucidate in 1995 we noitced the citzens are more likely to accomndtion into cities and also rural , for example we see nearly 50 prepertion whear as 20% in rural and comparsing to the 2010 i think the bar of cities it is kind of rise , in other hand we have very significantly decrease in rural , while the people are born out nation in 1995 it is prefer to live in cities etheir , we see the bar it is 60 percent and he is growing up very observe which in 2010 they have 80% , finaily to sum up we could say that it is very common to see like this digram bar.; In the chart, it is easy to see that in the year of 1995, there were about 70% of the population in urban areas, and there were only about 35% of people born outside Australia. As time went on, the proportion of Australians who lived in rural areas increased, and those born outside the country increased, which shows that the Australian population has changed. In urban areas, the proportion of Australians fell to about 60%, and the proportion of people born outside Australia rose to about 35%, while in rural areas, the proportion of Australians was only about 45% and the percentage of people born outside the country was only about 36%. The trend in town areas is similar to that in urban areas, and the percentage of Australians fell from about 65% to 65%, and the percentage of foreigners rose from about 15% to about 25%. In rural areas, the percentage of people born in Australia was only about 80% in 1995, and it was only about 75% in 2010. The percentage of foreigners was only about 6% to 8%. The changes may be related to factors such as migration policies, economic opportunities, and lifestyle preferences. In general, the data show that the percentage of foreigners is rising in urban and town areas, while the proportion of Australians in rural areas is relatively stable. It shows that Australia is becoming more and more diversified in terms of its population.
1170;The bar chart below gives information about vehicle ownership in China.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information.;The chart describes the data about vehicle ownership in a particular country, China from 1987 to 1999.Overall, the highest vehicle ownership occurred in the year 1999 while the lowest trend was recorded in the year 1987.According to the chart, China has less than 500 vehicle per thousand people during 1987. It is evident that there is an increment in the figures throughout the years. Within the two year interval, the number of vehicle ownership was already at 500. In 1991, 900 vehicle per thousand people were already in possession as depicted in the graph. In between 1991 to 1995, it went up gradually to nearly a thousand. Furthermore, the vehicle ownership doubled in number in 1995. Also, in an unspecified period of time, the number of vehicle possession in that country were approximately 3,000. By the end of year 1999, the numbers rose significantly to 4,100 vehicle per thousand people.; The bar chart shows that in the year 2000 the number of vehicles per thousand people was comparatively low, about 10 per thousand. The graph shows that the number of vehicles per thousand people increased significantly in the following years. In 2005, it was more than doubled, reaching about 25 per thousand. The number has gradually increased and in 2010 it was about 50 per thousand. Compared with this, the number of vehicles per thousand people was greatly increased in the following years. In 2015, the number of vehicles per thousand people more than tripled and reached a high of 120 per thousand. The growth in the number of vehicles can be attributed to the high income of the people, the perfect roads and the various types of vehicles. The bar chart also shows the development of the car industry in China, and the prosperity of the country's economy. The trend in this bar chart is very important to the policy-makers, economists and scholars who study the development of China's economy and the impact on the international automobile industry. The data show that China has been greatly developed and industrialized, and the people's living standards have been greatly improved.
702;The bar chart below shows the number of houses built per year in two cities, Derby and Nottingham, Between 2000 and 2009. Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.You should write at least 150 words.;Information is presented by the bar chart which illustrates the figure for houses built each year in Derby and Nottingham over a ten-year period from 2000 to 2009. Overall, it can be seen that there was a clear trend that houses in Derby were built more than that in Nottingham each year over the survey period, except for the year 2000, 2001 and 2007.Turning to the first main feature, there were just under 50 houses which were constructed in Derby for the first two years between 2000 and 2001, while the number of houses in Nottingham was an exact 50 and a little more than 50 in 2000 and 2001 respectively. The figure for houses in Derby then increased considerably to approximately 75 in 2002, which exceeded the number of houses in Nottingham, and plateaued at more than 100 until 2006. On the contrary, in 2002 the chart depicts a noticeable decline in the number of houses in Nottingham to less than 25. Nevertheless, the number of houses in Nottingham rebounded and rose to around 75 in 2005 before dropping suddenly to nearly zero in 2006.Turning to another main feature, whereas in 2007 the figure for houses in Derby remained unchanged at above 100, the number of houses in Nottingham soared to almost 200, exceeding the number of houses in Derby. The last key feature to point out is that the number of houses in Derby jumped dramatically to nearly 350 by 2009 while the number of houses in Nottingham experienced the third drop to almost zero in 2008 before the number of houses in Nottingham increased dramatically to 250 in 2009.; From the graph it can be seen that in the year 2000, when the houses built in the two cities were compared, there was a significant difference between the two, with 1,200 houses built in Nottingham and only 800 in Derby. At first sight, the numbers of houses built in the two cities show that in all but one year, Derby was building more houses than Nottingham. This trend continued until 2007 when both cities built the same number of houses, 1,400 and 1,000 respectively. It is also interesting to note that from 2007 onwards there is a noticeable decrease in the number of houses built in both cities, with the sharpest drop in the year 2008. In conclusion, the graph shows that in general Nottingham is building more houses than Derby, but this is probably due to the fluctuation of the number of houses being built, which is influenced by external factors such as economic conditions. An analysis of the data could provide valuable information for future housing projects and help with the planning of infrastructure and resource allocation. This information would be of great use to urban planners, local government and property developers who wish to study the housing situation in these two cities.
530;The bar chart below shows the numbers of men and women attending various evening courses at an adult education centre in the year 2009. The pie chart gives information about the ages of these course participants.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar chart shows what are the tendences of men and women in attending evening courses in an adult education centre during 2009 in a scale of 0 to 40 people, while the pie chart shows the percentages of ages of the participants in these courses.Fist of all, the most striking information is that women were largely more present in languages and painting courses than men, and that the vast majority of the participants in the overall courses were 50 years old or over.To begin with, it is clearly demonstrated that there were more women than men in all courses, except in sculture. In fact, men attended to language and drama courses were twice as less than women. Women were 40 in language courses and 20 in drama. Men were also slightly less in paiting, around 25 people, compared to women who were 30 at this course. However, in sculpture, men tended to be more present, as they were 10, which is roughly the double of the number of women who were present.Secondly, there was a marked tendence for people aged from 50 and over to attend a these courses, as they were slighlty more than two fifth. Just over a quarter of the people were between 40 and 49, while those who were 30-39 were just 16%. Finally, the youngest ones were not very present. In fact, the 20-29 years old group represented just 11%, while the under 20 were barely the half, with 5%.To conclude, it can be seen that the vast majority of the people who attended these evening courses were aged from 40 to 50 and over. Moreover, women tended to attend much more at all courses than men except for sculpture.; In 2009 the Adult Education Centre offered a number of evening courses, and participation varied depending on the subject. The most popular courses for women were language courses with 120 participants, while the most popular course for men was practical work with 50 participants. The majority of the participants belonged to the age group between 25 and 44, so it seems that this group was the most interested in attending the courses. The age group from 45 to 64 constituted the second largest group with 30 participants, and the numbers of participants under 25 and over 65 were smaller with 10 and 5 respectively. The relatively small number of younger and older participants may be a sign that the center should consider changing its programs or marketing strategy in order to attract this group. It also seems that more courses should be offered for men, given the relatively high interest in practical work and computers. The data in this report provides an insight into the center’s audience, and it can be used to guide the planning of future courses in order to provide the community with a better service.
960;The bar chart below shows the percentage of unemployed graduates, aged 20-24, in one European country over a two-year period.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and making comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart demonstrates the unemployed graduates who are between 20 and 24 years old by gender in percentage. The survey is conducted in one European country from 2008 to 2009.In general, the unemployment rates in males over a two-year period were higher than the females. The highest rate of unemployment in males was approximately 22% in Oct 2009, reaching nearly 40% more than females. Whereas the unemployment for female graduates in percentage was 6% reported in Apr 08, July 08 and Apr 09 which were the lowest rate of unemployment for graduates over the period.First of all, there was a slight decline in the unemployment rates for all graduates in the beginning of year, from 10% in Jan 08 to 7% in Apr 08 in males whilst female graduates decreasing from 7.5% to 6% . The unemployment for both genders in July 2008 remained same rates as previous. An increase in percentage of unemployed graduates in Oct 08 took nearly twofold of last month with males by 16% and females by 11%. Subsequently, a fall in the unemployment rates for all graduates were recorded in Jan 09, by 12.5% in men and 8% in women. A further reduction in the rate of unemployed female graduates in Apr 09 was 6% whilst there was no change in the male graduates. Afterwards, the unemployment rates in women returned to 10% in July 09 whereas there was a brief decrease in males by 11%. This was followed by a surge in the unemployment rates for graduates in Oct 09 by 22% for males and 14% for females.; In the first year, the unemployment rate among young graduates was relatively high, peaking at twelve per cent in the second quarter. The unemployment rate of graduates aged twenty-four is at a low level, with a peak of twelve per cent in the second quarter. The most striking feature of the chart is the significant fall in the unemployment rate from the first to the second year. In the third quarter, however, it fell to nine per cent, only to rise to eleven per cent at the end of the year. However, in the second year the situation has improved noticeably, and unemployment has been at a stable level between seven and eight per cent for the whole four quarters. Besides this, the chart shows some quarterly fluctuations in each year. For example, from eleven per cent in the last quarter of the first year to seven per cent in the first quarter of the second, there was a decrease of four per cent. This suggests a reversal in the job market for young graduates. In general, however, there was a general upward trend in unemployment over the two years. In the third quarter of each year, unemployment was lower, perhaps indicating seasonal fluctuations in the job market for graduates. However, the first and last quarters of each year were more difficult times for finding work. These quarterly fluctuations, together with the notable fall from the first to the second year, imply that the job market for young graduates is complex.
688;The bar chart below shows the total number of minutes (in billions) of telephone calls in Australia, divided into three categories, from 2001- 2008. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The bar chart displays the total number of minutes(in billions) of telephone calls in Australia. There are three types, specifically, local, national and international, and mobiles. Overall, it is clear the number of local telephone calls has the largest from 2001 to 2008, while the other two types, national and international, and mobiles steadily increased the number of telephone calls.Initially, there is a variation in local telephone calls from 2001 to 2008. The number of telephone calls started at 72 billion, and steadily soared and reached a peak of 90 billion in 2005. Then the number of billions slightly reduced and returned to 72 billion in 2008. Nevertheless, the number remained the highest in the three categories.Secondly, national and international, and mobiles can be seen steadily increase the number until 2008. National and international was 38 billion in 2001 and gradually rose up the number and reached the highest number in 2008. Specifically, it was 61 billion. Mobiles started the number only 2 billion in 2001. But the number constantly increased, and suddenly surged to 23 billion and 39 billion in 2006 and 2007 respectively. As a result, the number reached a peak of 46 billion in 2008. The gaps among three categories were quite large in 2001. It was 72, 38, and 2 in local, national and international mobile. And it resulted in a huge reduction of the gap in 2008. It was 72,61, and 46 in local,national and internationalal, and mobiles.; This is the bar chart about telephone calls in Australia from 2001 to 2008. It is clear that the number of local calls dropped from 70.6 billion minutes in 2001 to 42.9 billion minutes in 2008. It fell almost 40%. On the contrary, the number of national calls grew steadily from 21.4 billion minutes in 2001 to 43.6 billion minutes in 2008. It grew almost 200%. The number of international calls grew slower, but also increased from 2.4 billion minutes in 2001 to 4.1 billion minutes in 2008. This growth may be attributed to the development of business and the need for long-distance communication. Besides, the total number of minutes of telephone calls in Australia fluctuated and reached a peak in 2005, indicating a certain market saturation. In conclusion, this bar chart reveals a clear trend and significant change in the market for telephone calls in Australia from 2001 to 2008. These findings are of great significance to telecommunications companies and governments which can use the information to inform their strategies and policies on network development and service provision. The reduction of local calls, together with the rise of national and international calls, clearly shows the changing patterns of communication in Australia over this period.
362;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of how parents in a country spent time taking care of their children in the evening in 2022. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The bar chart demonstrates the proportions in which how parents spent time looking after their kids in the evening in the country, during the year 2022. The figures are given in percentage of time. Overall, there are four activities, including dressing, homework, playing games, and preparing for bed. which can be roughly classified into two groups. On one hand, mothers mainly oversee their children for dressing and homework with some helps from fathers, on the other hand, playing games and preparing for bed are done by both parents. Obviously, fathers spent time significantly less than mothers in all activities.To begin, The proportion of mothers taking care of theri children by dressing was approximately 75 percent which is the majority in the task. Likewise, around a half of homeworks were done by mothers while it was the acitivity which fathers take the most at about 10%.In contrast, both parents mainly took care of their children together to play games and to prepare for bed. Specifically, they both played games with their kids and prepared fot bed around 70 and 50 percent of time respectively. Furthermore, mothers spent 40 percent of time to prepare for bed.; The bar chart is an overview of the percentage of how parents in a country spent time taking care of their children in the evening in 2022. The most striking feature of the bar chart is that most parents, approximately 40 per cent, spend 1-2 hours a day taking care of their children, which shows that a large part of the evening is devoted to caring for children. A quick glance at the bar chart makes it obvious that there are large differences in how parents allocate time to take care of their children in different categories. A comparatively small percentage, approximately 5 per cent, spend less than one hour, which can be attributed to a number of reasons, such as working conditions and alternative care arrangements. On the other hand, approximately 25 per cent spend 2-4 hours a day, which indicates a significant dedication of evening care. Interestingly, a smaller percentage, approximately 10 per cent, spend more than four hours a day, which suggests a very extensive evening care routine. It is also interesting to note that the time spent by parents in the evening is distributed rather widely with the majority spending a relatively small amount of time. This could be due to several reasons, such as work-life balance, personal interests and shared child care. In addition, approximately 20 per cent spend 3-5 hours, which puts them between the two extremes of the distribution. The differences in time spent can be attributed to several factors, such as working conditions, personal preferences and the working environment, which makes it possible to conclude that the care situation for the evenings is complex. In conclusion, the bar chart reveals that there are large differences in the amount of time parents allocate to care for their children in the evening, and that a significant proportion of parents allocate a moderate amount of time.
626;The bar chart shows the percentage of the total world population in 4 countries in 1950 and 2002, and projections for 2050.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart depicts the proportion of the total world population in 4 countries in 1950 and 2002, and predictions for 2050. Overall, it can be seen India and China occupy much higher percentage in all periods while the USA, and Japan tend to be much smaller and drop down in 2002.It is clear that India steadily increases the percentage of its population since 1950. Specifically, the percentage in each period is 15 percent, around 17 percent, and will be approximately 18 percent, in 1950, 2002, and 2050 respectively. In contrast, China used to be the highest percentage of population in 1950 and 2002. The each percentage indicates more than 23 percent in 1950 and dropped to 20 percent in 2002. Furthermore, the prediction about population will plummet to 15 percent.Interestingly, firstly Japan was the smallest percentage in 4 countries in 1950 and slightly goes down in 2002. The percentage seems to be about 4 percent in 1950 and its percentage will plummet to approximately 1 percent in 2050. The USA also goes down population 5 percent in 2002, but the percentage will stay the same in 2050.; In 1950, China had the largest population of all countries with 22.8 per cent, followed by India with 15.5. The United States and Japan have a far smaller population with 6.9 and 2.8 per cent respectively. A forecast for 2050 predicts that India will have the largest population of all countries with 18.4 per cent, followed by China with 11.8 per cent. In 1950, China's population was over 22 per cent. India's population in 1950 was over 15 per cent. The United States population is stable with 5.1 per cent, and Japan's population is decreasing with 1.9 per cent. There is an important difference between China and India: China's population is still greater than India's in 2050. The United States population will be reduced further to 3.6 per cent, and Japan's population will continue to decrease to 1.2 per cent. This decline reflects the relatively low population growth rate of the United States and Japan compared to the other two countries. The decline of the population of the United States and Japan is also a reflection of the difference in the population growth rate of the four countries. This is also a reflection of the uneven population growth in the world.
1136;The bar chart shows the scores of teams A, B and C over four different seasons.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The graphic gives information about the scores obtained by three teams (A, B and C) in four seasons. Team B compared to the other two is that obtained more points over the years. On the other hand, teams A and B mantain their scores low. 2004 is the year in which there is less discrepancy in the scores of the three teams. Instead, in 2002 there is more disparity.Over the years the three teams always modify their score. The score of each of the teams rises and then goes down. For instance, the scores of team A is that subjected to more modifications. It start very low. In 2003 were registered an increase and then the points rapidly go up in 2003. The scores changed from 11 points to 35. After that, the points start to diminish again. Team B obtained always the highest scores over the years. However also this team's score is subject to various change. The score was very high in 2002 and is just 43 in 2004. In 2005 the score raises again. Team C totalise the lowest score over the years, and the scores are subjected just to small variations.2004 is the year in which there is less disparity between the score of team B and the other two. Team A in 2004 had totalised 35 point and team B only 8 point more. Even if the points of team C are 12, the overall score's dicrepancy is less than in other year. Indeed, in 2002 there is a huge dicrepancy concerning the scores of the teams. Team B obtained 82 points while the other two teams obtained respectively 5 points (team A) and 10 points (team B).; In the first season, Team A scored 80 points, followed by Team B with 60 points and Team C with 40 points. A quick look at the bar chart tells us that the team A has consistently performed better than the other two teams throughout the four seasons. In the second season, team A scored 85 points, while team B and C scored 70 points and 50 points respectively. In the third season, the difference between team A and the other two teams grew smaller when team A scored 80 points, while team B scored 75 points and team C scored 60 points. In the fourth season, the gap between team A and the other two teams narrowed further when team A scored 75 points and the gap between team B and team C became smaller, as they scored 70 points and 55 points respectively. Notably, the score of team C rose sharply from 40 points in the first season to 70 points in the last season. In conclusion, the score of team A was relatively stable at 85 points in the second season, while the score of team B and C rose significantly from the first season to the last. However, comparing with the overall performance of the two teams, team C’s score showed the greatest improvement. On the other hand, team B’s performance varied from season to season and the score fluctuated between 60 and 75 points.
272;The bar charts below show the number of hours each teacher spent teaching in different schools in four different countries in 2001.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar graph illustrates the amount of teaching hours of teacher in primary, lower secondary and upper secondary schools in Japan, Spain, Iceland and the USA. It's clearly can seen the teacher who teach higher students spend time to teach more than lower.In european countries, their teacher have to teach nearly hours in upper secondary schools at 900 hours. Thus, Iceland and Spain still has big gap in primary and lower secondary schools. The teacher in primary schools in Iceland spend almost 600 hours which shorter time than Spain (more than 600 hours). Same way in lower secondary schools, Iceland and Spain teacher spend 600 and 750 hours, respectively.In other countries, teachers in Japan spend the smallest time of four countries in average at 600, 625 and 650 hours. In the USA, teachers spend the largest time of teaching at 625, 950 and almost 1200 hours in primary lower secondary and upper secondary schools.; The bar charts indicate that the number of hours teachers spend teaching varies considerably between the countries. The country with the highest average teaching hours is the United States, with 1,050 per year, closely followed by Australia, with 1,000. A closer examination of the data suggests that this difference may be due to differences in the educational systems of the four countries. The United States, for example, has a highly decentralized system, with great variation in teaching hours between schools and districts. In contrast, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have considerably lower teaching hours, with 900 and 900 respectively. The data also suggest that the number of teaching hours may have an effect on the educational outcomes for students. In the United States and Australia, for example, the high number of teaching hours may be beneficial in that they may provide more opportunities for students to learn. In contrast, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have more centralized systems, with teaching hours more uniform across the country. It is clear that further research and analysis are needed to fully understand the relationship between the number of teaching hours and educational outcomes for students. It is also important to consider the quality and effectiveness of teaching rather than just the number of hours spent teaching. This is important for policy-makers and educators to consider in order to optimize the number of teaching hours and improve educational quality.
314;The bar charts below shows the number of visits to a community website in the first and second year of use.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and mae comparisons with relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the quantity of visits by the thousands paid to a community website within the first two years of use.Overall, there is a greater upward trend from the second year of use compared to the first year of use. In addition to that, in both years the website undergoes a drastic fluctuation in numbers. It can be observed that initially in the month of September, number of visits in the first year of use are lower than second year of use, but numbers of the former subsequently surpasses the latter in the final month of August.In regards to the first year of use, quantity of visits increases from about 2000 visits in September to 10000 visits within 2 months and remains constant for another month. Following that, numbers plummet from December to February, reaching a low-point of less than approximately 500 visits. The numbers rise gradually from February onwards until it reaches it's highest at 15000 by August.On the other hand, during the second year of use, the number of visits rises sharply from about 2500 visits to around 17500 visits. Soon, the visits dip to 10000 only by February, persisting to March. The trend then increases steadily until it touches roughly 22500 visits in July, but drops once again to less than 13000.; In the first year the number of visits was relatively low with June as the best month, with around 35,000 visits. A quick glance at the charts shows a dramatic increase in visits between the two years, indicating a growing interest and involvement in the site. The second year showed a steady increase with all months exceeding the first year’s highest month. February was the lowest month, with about 20,000 visits. This suggests that the site was still in its infancy, perhaps still developing its base of users and establishing its presence on the web. Looking at the second year compared to the first, the main feature is the constant rise in visits, with some months in the second year exceeding the first year’s monthly figure by more than 100 percent. The second year’s highest month, October, had a huge 70,000 visits, more than doubling the highest month in the first year. The doubling in visits could indicate a successful development of the site’s following and interest in the site, perhaps through new features or more effective marketing. The dramatic rise in visits from the first to the second year indicates that the site’s influence and users were growing. The steady increase demonstrates the site’s increasing popularity, with the consistent increase indicating a rise in popularity and a larger audience. In conclusion, the charts show a growth and success for the site. These patterns suggest the site was successful in attracting a larger audience and maintaining their interest. This success should continue in the future, indicating that the site’s influence and presence on the web is continuing to grow.
1408;The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise age limit for the younger drivers and to lower age limit for the aged ones. Do you agree?;With the rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the with hush and rush lifestyles of drivers today, traffic accidents seem to be escalating in our society. partly to number of traffic accidents but surely not as the main factor.Those who agree with would view young drivers assuming under 18 years old and older drivers to be reckless and therefore would be more prone to traffic accidents on the road. Lack of experience, forgetfulness, carelessness and poor fitness condition may be reasons for limiting age of drivers.On the other hand, I would think that age is only a small determinant and we need to look at more effective measure such as reducing number of vehicles on the road through car pool, implementing more stringent regulations on alcohol drink driving and possibly to revise on the standard of driving test for young and old drivers on the road. Many drivers who are stuck in traffic jams also have busy lifestyles and therefore tend to become very stressed or distracted on the road. Thus I would think the government may have to look ways to improve road infrastructure and traffic jams to deter or reduce accidents on the road.To sum up, age is only one of the many contributors for accidents but I do not agree that age for the elderly and raising age limit for the younger drivers is the best method. As mentioned in my third paragraph, we need to look at other more effective measures which deal with the underlying problems in the society which lead to traffic accidents.; I strongly disagree with this view. I do not think that increasing the age limit for younger drivers will necessarily reduce the number of accidents. It is obvious that this view shows a lack of understanding of the causes of accidents. Younger drivers are more prone to accidents because of their lack of experience and at times their recklessness. But instead of increasing the age limit, we should train them better to drive and instill in them a sense of responsibility. As for lowering the age limit for the aged, I believe that it is not only impractical but also dangerous. As one grows older, one’s reflexes slow down, one’s eyesight diminishes, one’s physical and mental condition deteriorates, and it is quite likely that their ability to drive will be impaired and the chances of accidents are increased. Better to reduce the number of accidents by a combination of measures like improved driver training, stricter traffic regulations, better road and vehicle construction, and an increased awareness of the importance of following safety regulations will have a greater impact on accident figures than just lowering the age limit. In my opinion, instead of lowering the age limit, the government should do regular medical check-ups of the aged drivers to ensure that they are still capable of driving. I believe that to reduce the number of accidents, a combination of measures rather than just a lowering or raising of age limits is necessary.
1414;The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise the age limit for younger drivers and to lower the age limit for aged drivers. Do you agree ?;Traffic accidents are on the rise these days. Most of the accidents injuries or death. Research have found that most of the accidents are caused by inexperienced drivers, for example young drivers.Young drivers tend to be more daring and are unable to avoid a crush when they face one. They tend to be more daring after drinking alcohol at night and this causes them to lose control of the car. Drunk driving will not only risk a person’s own life but may also cause an life to be lost.The government should encourage the driving to conduct driving lessons for drivers for a longer period. This will give them a clear picture about how accidents happen and teach them about the safety of others on the road. Drivers that have been in an accident after drunk driving should be from driving for at least two years and be given driving lessons again.However, for the aged drivers, the government should not only the age limit but also check the capability of the aged drivers for instance eyesight, hearing and other related health conditions to ensure safe driving. It does not mean that an aged person not fit to drive and has a problem with the heart but a young or a middle aged person could also have heart failure these days.To conclude, I feel that to raise the of young drivers not the best solution but to about the problems they may encounter on the road and to ban them from driving if they have caused an accident due to carelessness. As for the drivers, as long as they are capable on the road before a certain age and there are no health issues there shouldn’t be a problem.; I strongly disagree with the proposition that the best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise the age limit for younger drivers and to lower the age limit for older drivers. Raising the age limit for younger drivers would restrict the freedom and mobility of young people, especially in remote areas where public transportation is in short supply. This would not only be impractical but would be unfair to young and old drivers. Besides, lowering the age limit for older drivers would not solve the problem either. Many young people are unable to find a way to school, work or other essential places of business without the help of their own transportation. In fact, studies have shown that the older a driver is, the more likely he is to be involved in an accident because of his physical and mental limitations. It is more sensible to have regular vision and driving tests to ensure that old drivers are still safe and capable of driving. We should focus on implementing safety measures that have been proven to be effective, such as graduated driver licenses for young people and regular tests for older drivers, in order to reduce the number of accidents involving both groups. Raising the age limit for young drivers and lowering the age limit for old drivers would not be an effective and sensible way to reduce the number of traffic accidents.
31;The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;These days it is firmly believed that the most efficient method to teach children in schools how to work together is through team sports. This essay disagrees with the statement since some young students might not enjoy playing sports and because team sports can raise competitiveness amongst children, hence having a negative impact on their friendly relationships.First of all, although it is vital for a children to play sports and keep fit, not everyone is keen on football, rugby and volleyball. Instead, some young students prefer spending their leisure time on other activities such as joining a chorus group or teathre lessons. These activities can encourage cooperation and make children get along with each other, as well. On the other hand, forcing children to play something they doesn't feel comfortable in can make them withdraw from the team game, which would make them feel excluded.In addition, teams sports do not always promote cooperation among players. In some cases, inequities or particularly ambitious behaviours can lead to violent competitiveness, instead. It is generally thought that sport is an extremely selective environment, in fact you need to exercise daily in order to keep fit. If obese children took part in those team sports as well, they could feel isolated because they do not own the perfect body to perform well.In conclusion, although team sports are a great method to teach children how to get along with each other, there are various activities which can encourage cooperation among children, as well. Therefore, it is considerably significant for a school to embrace diversity and make children play with what they really like, instead of forcing them to do something they feel they don't belong.; Firstly, I agree that team sports can be a very important opportunity for children to learn to cooperate, but I do not completely agree that it is the best way to teach them this important skill. Although team sports such as soccer, hockey, and hockey are the most popular among children, they teach children to learn discipline, work hard and teamwork, which are essential to success in all fields. The common goal they pursue helps them develop the ability to communicate, to respect and to trust each other. These sports also encourage children to work together, share ideas and learn from each other. However, I believe that teamwork can also be taught and learned in other ways. In addition, not all children are interested or talented in sports and therefore do not benefit from this teaching. In conclusion, I believe that school sports are not the only way to teach children to cooperate and that there are other approaches to teaching cooperation. It is important that children are given opportunities to work together, share ideas and learn from each other, regardless of the circumstances. A well-balanced education with different teaching methods will help children develop this important life skill and prepare them for the future.
982;The chart and table below give information about population figures in Japan.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar graph and table provide information about population numbers of past, present and future in Japan from in the year of 1950 to 2055. It can be observed that numbers of total population and elderly people changes between these years.Overall, Japan's population rose until 2005 and drops from that point as future prediction indicates. Likewise, the population of aged 65 or over rose until certain point.Taking a closer look at the graph, it can be seen that population is increased regularly from 1950 to 2005. While it was 84.1 millions in the year 1950, it is peaked in 2005 with reaching 127.8 millions. However, it will decrease from 2005 to 2055 with reaching 89.9 millions.On the other hand, if we look at the table, we can see that elderly people's population rose from 4.1 millions in 1950 to 25.7 million in 2005. The increase is expected until 2035 with predicting to reach 37.2 millions, however, it would drop to 36.5 millions in 2055.; This table shows one of the main features, which is the rapid increase in the elderly population. The chart and table below show some interesting trends in Japan’s population, especially in the age distribution and total numbers. The chart shows the decrease in the percentage of people under fifteen. This shows a decline in the birth rate and an aging society. The population of people over 65 has increased significantly, and the proportion of people over 65 has increased. Comparing the population figures between different age groups, the population between fifteen and sixty-four has decreased. This may cause a decline in the labour force and consequently a decline in the economy. This trend is expected to continue, which will have a serious impact on the economy. The data show that Japan is in a period of decline, and the effects of a declining birth rate and an aging population are beginning to show. The rise in the elderly population highlights the need for Japan to develop policies that will support this group, such as the provision of health and social security, and possibly the need for more immigration to balance the population.
664;The chart below gives information about global population percentages and distribution of wealth by region.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The chart indicates information about global population percentages and distribution of wealth by eight regions. Clearly, three regions contribute to global wealth remarkably higher than others, while the five regions' distribution of wealth is all less than five percent.To begin with, these three regions, North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacefic can be seen much high percentage. Specifically, it is close to 35 percent, 30 percent, and nearly 25 percent, in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacefic respectively. Noticeable point is that North America's population is the sixth highest. In contrast, the distribution of wealth percentage reached a peak of nearly 35 percent.Secondly, China has the highest population. Specifically, it is close to a quarter, while the second and third countries have approximately 15 percent. In contrast, the distribution of wealth is not so larger than other countries. Although Europe's population is 15 percent and the distribution of wealth is 30 percent, the percentage of distribution of wealth in China is approximately three percent. This is only one-tenths, compared with Europe. Another noteworthy point is Latin America and Caribean. This is the only region the percentage of the population and global wealth is not significantly wide. It is more than six percentage of the population and around four percentage of global wealth.; The most obvious feature of the chart is the significant inequality in wealth distribution between the regions. North America has only 5% of the world population but has a staggering 30% of the wealth. Europe and North America together have over two-thirds of the world’s wealth, but only around 15% of the population. Africa and South Asia have 60% of the world population but have only 5% and 10% of the wealth respectively. In the meanwhile, countries with large populations, such as South Asia and Africa, have relatively small shares of global wealth, indicating the lack of wealth and development in these regions. This large inequality of wealth distribution highlights the great divide between the West and the rest of the world. In conclusion, the chart shows a picture of extreme inequality in wealth distribution, with a small percentage of the world’s population having a disproportionate amount of wealth. This suggests that more equitable economic development and wealth distribution is needed in order to tackle the world’s problems of poverty and inequality. It is also noticeable that East Asia and the Pacific has around a quarter of the world’s population but around a quarter of the wealth, suggesting a more equitable distribution of wealth in this region. However, the global economic order needs to be reformed in order to achieve more equitable distribution of wealth. It is therefore important for governments and international organisations to take note of the picture of wealth distribution presented in the chart in order to create a fairer, more equitable global economy.
504;The chart below shows global sales of the top five mobile phone brands between 2009 and 2013.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar chart below indicates mobile phone market share for the best five different brands Samsung, Apple, Nokia, LG and ZTE between 2009 and 2013. The best two brands were Samsung and Nokia, more than 400 annually. The others were below less than 150 in the same period of time.In 2009, Nokia has reached almost 450 when the second best brand Samsung was lower than 250. The sales of Samsung soared to the top in 2013 when Nokia slipped down to 250 in the same year. The biggest drop of Nokia presented between 2011 and 2013 from over 400 to 250.The apple's market share was in the fifth position with no more than 50 in 2009. It has a similar trend like Samsung however in 2013 it has 150 sales. LG and ZTE were the relative small portion compared to Samsung and Nokia. The ZTE was improving slowly when LG was losing its market share every year.; In 2009, Nokia's sales were about 440 million, and Samsung's were about 220 million. The data show that the leading brand is Nokia, which dominates the market by a large margin. During this period, Nokia's sales fell year on year, and in the second half of 2011 there was a sharp decline. On the other hand, Samsung's sales grew steadily, and in 2012 they hit 390 million. By the end of this period, they had overtaken Nokia as the leading brand. The other two brands, Sony and LG, had stable sales, but Sony's sales were higher than LG's. Sales of Apple, on the other hand, showed a marked upward trend. The figures in 2009 were about 90 million, and in 2013 they were about 170 million. The data suggest that customer preferences and technological development have played a key role in determining the sales trends of the leading mobile phone brands. In summary, the chart offers valuable insights into the global sales of the top five mobile phone brands between 2009 and 2013. For business and research professionals, a better understanding of these trends will be crucial. In the light of these data, it is clear that the mobile phone industry is a rapidly changing industry.
1128;The chart below shows numbers of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles travelled (PMT) by transportation type in 2002.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The chart illustrates numbers of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles travelled in 2002. It is divided into five transportation type: by commuter rail, by heavy rail, by light rail, by bus and by demand response.Overall, we notice the highest number of incident and injuries is due to transportation by demand response, while the use of commuter rail has the lowest number of these accidents. The number of injuries is lower than incident in all cases.In the case of commuter rail, the number of incidents which represents less than 30 incidents per 100 million PMT is almost equal to the number of injuries. The graph shows some similarities when we use light rail or bus, especially in regards of incidents. The numbers of incidents in both cases are about 75 incidents per 100 million PMT. However, the number of injuries increases from approximately 40 to 60 injuries per 100 million PMT. The transportation by demand response is responsible of more than 250 incidents and 150 injuries per 100 million PMT.; It can be seen at a glance that the various types of transport vary considerably in their degree of safety. The chart shows the numbers of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger-kilometres traveled (100 million PTK) by transportation type in 2002. In the case of injuries, the same pattern can be seen. Taking a motorcycle was by far the most dangerous means of transport with a staggering 213.31 incidents per 100 million PTK. This contrast clearly shows the extreme difference in safety between these two modes of transport. In this respect, it can be seen that not only are the numbers of motorcycle accidents much higher, but they are also much more likely to cause injury. Another interesting comparison is between rail and air transport. Taking a bus again proved to be the safest way of travelling, with only 0.12 injuries per 100 million PTK. This, combined with the figures for rail and air transport, indicate the excellent safety record maintained by these two forms of transport. The data suggest that motorcycles carry the greatest risk, while buses, trains and planes are the safest forms of transport. These findings have important implications for transport policy and safety regulations, indicating the need for more targeted measures to improve safety standards for the various forms of transport.
1072;The chart below shows the amount of leisure time enjoyed by men and women of different employment status.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar chart illustrates the information about how long male people and female people spent their time on leisure activities according to the sorts of job.Overall, it is clear that, the majority of those who retire their occupation or are not in employment, spent most of the time on leisure activities. Plus, male people were inclined to enjoy more time on chilling activities than females.Looking at the males in more detail, the figures for retired or unemployed male guys showed the highest range with over 80 hours in a week, meanwhile, other guys who obtained full-time job spent approximately 42 hours per week.With regard to women, most of them who finished their working life or were not yet to be employed had just under 80 hours for leisure time in every week, but there were just roughly 40 hours which was spent by women who were in charge hosewives, full-time job and part-time employment.; This chart shows the amount of leisure time enjoyed by men and women of different employment status. It is clear at first glance that there is a significant difference between men and women of different employment status and gender. Among those who work full-time, men have the least leisure time and the leisure time of women is less than four hours per day, but the leisure time of women is slightly less than three and a half hours per day. The chart also shows that the leisure time of retired men and women is more than eight hours a day, which may be related to the fact that retired people have more free time to rest, enjoy hobbies, and do other things. The leisure time of part-time workers and unemployed people is more than six hours a day for men and five and a half hours a day for women. This chart provides an important indication of the distribution of leisure time between men and women of different employment status. It is also noteworthy that, no matter what occupation, men have more leisure time than women. This may be related to some other factors, such as the division of labor between family and career, or the fact that the family is divided into two occupations. It can also be seen that the distribution of leisure time is related to the relationship between work and life, and the importance of leisure to the quality of life. .

The graph shows the trends in consumption of fast foods.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The graph illustrates the money spent by different classes of people on fast foods in britain.Overall,we can see that the people of high income and average income spent a lot on hamburger where as the amount of money spent on pizza is nearly same for every class of people.The high income group spent about 45 bucks on hamburger surpassing the average income and low income group which spent about 33 bucks and 14 bucks respectively.In contrast about 17 dollars were spent on fish and chips by high class people which is low compared to average class which spent about 25 bucks.the money that is spent on pizza is relatively low in all groups except in the high income group where the pizza expenses are higher than fish and chips expenses.The expenses on hamburger of low income population is relatively low compared to high and average income population.Surprisingly, the amount of money spent on fish and chips is similar to high incomegroup which is about 17 bucks and the money spent by average income people is highest of all.Pizza expenses by low income group is about 7 dollars which is extremely low when compared with high and average income group.; According to the chart, the amount spent on fast foods each week fluctuated over the period. The amount spent on fast foods each week fluctuated over the period. According to the chart, the upward trend can be attributed to the growing popularity of inexpensive and convenient meals. This figure began to rise sharply and reached a peak of nearly 18 million pounds, suggesting an increase in the demand for fast foods in the UK. In the middle of the period, the amount spent on fast foods fell to about 12 million pounds. This fall may have been due to a number of reasons, including a change in customer preferences, the introduction of new fast food choices, and the increased availability of alternatives. Despite this decrease, fast food expenditure continued to rise, reaching a new peak towards the end of the period, with an estimated amount of 20 million pounds per week. The data indicate the growing popularity of fast foods, as well as their decline and recovery. The resurgence of fast food expenditure may indicate that the industry has adapted to changing customer needs, or that the popularity of fast food remains strong among the British population. In any case, the data provide valuable insights into the dynamics of fast food consumption in the UK, and the need for further monitoring and analysis of this area is obvious. The information in the chart is useful for fast food industry players, such as restaurants, marketers and policymakers, who can use this data to inform their decisions and strategies.
864;The chart below shows the amount spent on six consumer goods in four European countries.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The following graph gives information about the amount spent on six consumer materials in Britain, France, Italy and Germany. These materials are photographic film, toys, CDs, perfumes, tennis racquets and personal stereos.Overall, Britian comes in the lead in consuming the above goods, while Germany consumes the less.First of all, photograpic film and DCs are showing the same trend with Britain consumes 170 for the former and 167 for latter. Follows by France the Italy leaving Germany with only 150 from photographic film and 145 from CDs. Perfumes and tennis racquets also show similar trend, while Britain in the lead with 160 for former and 155 for latter, Italy comes next followes by Germany leaving France as lowest consumer with 145 and 140 subsecquently. Personal shoes data shows Britain with 155. Nevertheless, same amount between France and Germany socring the lowest with 146. Finally, for toys, Britian scores 166. Meanwhile, both Italy and france score 156 leaving Germany at bottom with 145.; The information shows that Germany has the highest spending on consumer goods, because it ranks first in four out of the six groups. The data also shows that there are significant differences between countries. France spends a lot more on food than Germany, and the UK is the smallest spender on cars. On the other hand, the UK spends relatively more on electrical appliances. An analysis of the table shows that the expenditure in Italy is very low, except for clothes, where it ranks second. In conclusion, the information reveals that spending on consumer goods varies from country to country. The high spending on food in France may be explained by the country's reputation for its food, while Germany's car industry may be the reason for its high spending on cars. The data may be useful for marketing people, politicians and economists trying to understand the buying habits of people in these countries. It may be that the spending habits of people in the different countries vary because of cultural, economic and industrial differences.
96;The chart below shows the expenditure on three categories among different age groups of residents in the UK in 2004.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of total allocation of expenses in three major categories among the citizens of the United Kingdom from five different age groups in the year 2004.Overall, the spending on food and drink continuously increased as the residents reached the older ages. Moreover, spending on entertainment activities also incresased but declined when reaching the later age, while going to a restaurant and hotel was its peak during early age and its lowest was upon reaching the retirement age.Food and drink are part of our daily necessisties, and as a family member grows in number, the more food and drink a family consumed. Over other categories, food and drink are more essential and priority of every residents as the total spending of it increased every fifteen years. This explains why the total expenditure of residents in the UK is mostly on food and drink. From age under 30 with almost 7% only, it sharply increased up to 23% in age 76 and above.In addition, expenses on entertainment reached its peak level of 23%, the same percentage with food and drink but in different age goup, in 61 to 75. In this stage, people already reached the retirement age wherein entertainment activities became a hobby while still having energy. But upon reaching 76 years and above, it declined to just 13%. However, expenditure in eating on a restaurant and staycation on a hotel were high with 14% under 30 years of age, while it dramatically decreased to below 3% upon reaching 61 to 75 years of age.; The information in the table shows different spending patterns across the age groups. The most striking feature of the table is that the expenditure on housing is relatively high in all age groups with the highest expenditure on housing in the group of people aged 25-44, who spend around £12,000. This shows that the expenditure on housing is higher in younger households, where there are more members. On the other hand, the group of people over the age of 65 spends the least on housing, with an average expenditure of £6,000. A great difference is shown in the amount of expenditure on transport in the different age groups, with the group of people aged between 25 and 44 spending the most, around £2,500, probably on family and business travel. However, the group of people aged between 45 and 64 stands out, spending about £4,000 on food, perhaps due to an increased disposable income and a tendency to spend more on quality of life. Compare the overall expenditure. It is clear that housing dominates the spending pattern of all UK residents, regardless of their age. The expenditure on transport decreases with age, with the group of people aged between 25 and 44 spending the most, about £20,000, and the group of people over the age of 65 spending the least, about £1,000. It is also clear that the expenditure on food increases with age. Taking these figures into account, it can be concluded that the spending priorities of UK residents are determined largely by age and younger households bear a heavier burden.
984;The chart below shows the results of a survey of people who visited four types of tourist attraction in Britain in 1999.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The pie chart on the left shows the distribution of visitors to four types of tourist attractions in the year 1999 in Britain. This pie chart shows that most visitors are attracted by the Theme Parks and Museums & Galleries, which attracted 38% and 37% of visitors. Historic Houses and Monuments attract 16% of the visitors. Wildlife Parks and Zoos have the least attractions to visitors, which is only 9%. Besides the pie chart, there is a table that shows which part of the Theme parks people like to visit. The most popular place is the Blackpool Pleasure Beach which 47% of people visit. Besides Blackpool Pleasure Beach, other parts of the Theme Parks attraction similar percentage of visitors. The Alton Towers attracted 17% of visitors and Pleasureland, Southport attracted 16%. Both Chessington World of Adventures and Legoland, Windsor attract 10% of the people. This is the distribution of visitors to different types of tourist attractions in Britain, 1999, and the distribution of where visitors like to go in the Theme Parks.; From the chart, the most popular type of tourist attraction was historic houses and castles, with over two thousand visitors. Describe what the chart tells us about the preferences of tourists who visit Britain. The second most popular attraction was zoos and animal parks, with over eight hundred visitors. This was nearly twice as many as visited museums and art galleries. Finally, theme and adventure parks attracted the fewest visitors with less than four hundred. Comparing the different types of tourist attraction, it is obvious that tourists who visit Britain prefer historic and cultural sights, such as museums and art galleries. On the other hand, theme and adventure parks are less popular. The number of visitors to the museums and art galleries is much smaller than the number of visitors to the historic houses and castles. The above findings have implications for Britain’s tourist industry, and for promoting the country’s cultural and historical heritage. Britain can provide a better service to tourists if it promotes its rich history and culture.
450;The chart below shows the total number of Olympic medals won by twelve different countries.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The chart compares the number of medals won by 12 countries in Olympics. In brief, USA won the biggest amount of medalls overall and in each category followed by Soviet Union and UK. The difference between USA and Soviet Union is much bigger than between Soviet Union and UK, more than 2000 medals for USA, 1000 for Soviet Union and more than 500 for UK. France, Germany and Italy also passed the freshhold of 500 medals, closely followed by Sweden and Hungary with less than 500 medals. Australia follows Sweden with the same amount of silver and bronze medals but fewer gold. East Geramny has the same amount of gold medals, but fewer amount of silver and bronze than Hungary. The smallest amount of medals was won by Japan and China. The major trend for all the countries is that all types of medals: gold, silver and bronze are close to being proportionate to one another.; The table shows that the United States dominates the chart, with an overwhelming total of 1022 medals. The second most medals are won by the Soviet Union, with 473 medals, and third is Great Britain with 263. The United States, the Soviet Union and Britain together accounted for more than half of all medals won, indicating that they were the dominant force in the Olympic games. In contrast, the medals total for Spain, Sweden and Denmark was in the range of ten to fifty. A further notable feature of the chart is the considerable gap between the top three and the rest of the table. The fact that Germany, France and Italy also have substantial medals totals, 146, 136 and 118 respectively, indicates that they too have a strong sporting tradition and have consistently performed well in the Olympic games. The information on the medals won by the twelve countries in the table could be used to establish the relative sporting strengths and weaknesses of the different countries, which could be useful in planning future sporting strategies. In summary, the chart clearly shows the United States, the Soviet Union and Britain as the main contributors to the Olympic games, but that other countries have also made important contributions. Generally, the table provides a useful insight into the sporting achievements of the different countries at this prestigious international event.
1100;The chart shows the number of mobile phones and landlines per 100 people in selected countries.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information given.;The bar chart illustrates the information on the number of people who are using mobile phones and landlines per 100 people in 7 different countries.Overall, the total number of mobile phones per 100 people are higher than land line. Among the countries, Italy is one of the country that uses the highest number of mobile phones per 100 people.More specifically, 90 phones are used per 100 people in Italy, followed by Sweden and the UK at close to 90 and 85 phones respectively. From the figure, mobile phones were least popular in Canada, approximately 40 per cent of the people carry mobile phones which the percentage of mobile phone users are lower than one-half users in Italy.On the other hand, land lines are mostly loved in Denmark at 85 and 90 per cent. However, most other countries remain between 55 to 70 per cent. Interestingly, Italy has the least proportion of users having just over 40 phones per 100 people.; It can be seen that in all the countries represented, mobile phones are spread more than landlines. The countries with the highest number of mobile phones per 100 inhabitants are Sweden and the United States with an average of about ninety-five and ninety-five mobile phones per hundred inhabitants. However, the number of landlines per hundred inhabitants is significantly lower in all countries. For example, Sweden has about 55 landlines per hundred inhabitants, the United States has about 45. This suggests that the ownership of mobile phones in these countries is at or near a maximum level. Another notable thing is the different extent of the penetration of mobile and landline phones in individual countries. Developing countries, which are not mentioned in the diagram, but which can be assumed, have a much lower number of mobile and landline phones per hundred inhabitants than developed countries. This shows the increasing popularity of mobile communication compared to the use of landlines. In addition, the diagram also shows that in the selected countries, mobile phones dominate over landlines, which reflects the global trend towards the use of communication tools. Moreover, the data hint at the extent to which access to communication devices and their use vary significantly between developed and developing countries. This reveals the digital gap between developed and developing countries and the unequal development of the world's communications network. If further research on this trend is done, it may provide a valuable contribution to the understanding of the social and economic impact of communication tools.
414;The chart shows the unemployment situation in Australia in the year 2012.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The line chart compared the percentage of people unemployed in Australian rural and urban areas in 2012. Overall, the two kinds of areas presented the opposite trends through the four quarters, with the number in urban areas rising and that of rural areas declining.Urban areas witnessed a considerable fluctuation throughout the whole timeframe. At the start of the first quater, unemployment rate in urban areas started low at slightly over 2%. The percentage climbed steadily and reached its first peak at the end of the second season at about 4%. However, it dropped to the start point again during the third, and continued to rise after that, closing the year at another new record at nearly 5%.On the other hand, rural areas demonstrated a more consistent change. Beginning significantly higher than urban areas at around 6.5%, its unemployment rate dropped to only 4.5% after the first two seasons. Although there were some fluctuations, the gap between rural and urban areas gradually narrowed down. The final unemployment rate for rural areas was 5%, decreasing by 1.5% compared to the start.; At first glance, the unemployment rate seems to be quite stable at 5.2 percent, with minor fluctuations between 5.1 and 5.3 percent. The chart shows the employment situation in Australia in the year 2012 quite clearly. New South Wales and Victoria, the two most populated states, had unemployment rates below the national average, approximately 4.8 and 4.9 percent respectively. This suggests that the labor market in these states is stronger than in other states. The main feature of the chart is the differences in unemployment rates between the states. This suggests that the economy and employment opportunities vary between states. On the other hand, the unemployment rate in states such as Tasmania and South Australia is much higher, approximately 6.2 and 5.8 percent respectively. Compared to other countries, the unemployment rate in Australia is quite low. However, the unemployment rate in the 15- to 24-year-old age group is significantly higher, about 11.3 percent. This is approximately double the national average, which shows that young people face a difficult job market. The chart paints a complex picture of the unemployment situation in Australia in the year 2012, highlighting the stability of the labor market and the challenges faced by certain regions and age groups. However, the differences between states and age groups emphasize the need for targeted economic policies that tackle both the regional and age-related inequalities in the labor market.
556;The charts below compare the age structure of the populations of France and India in 1984.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;These bar charts illustrate different ages categories from 0-5 years old to over 70 of people living in France and India during the year of 1984.Overall, France population ages present various percentages not over 4% between males and females, whereas in India with the increase of age the percentages decreased gradually.Firstly, a bulk of population in France from 10-15 to 30-35 age category of males and females had the highest averages with almost 3,5%, whereas from 40-45 to 60-65 reached approximately 2,7%. By contrast it is noticeable that from 70-75 to 80-85 females were around only the half of the total percentage and males no more than 1%.Secondly, In india the highest proportion of population is the young of 0-5 to 15-20 with nearly 7% and 6% respectively. Moreover, the medium categories both males and females that represent the half of the total percentages is 30-35 to 50-55. By contrast, it is clearly seen that the over 60 population reached just no more than 3%.;" At first sight it can be seen that the population pyramid of India is much wider at the bottom than that of France. It is obvious that the French population pyramid is more narrow at the bottom and more rounded at the top. This is due to the relatively high birth rate in India, with its relatively young population, as compared with the lower birth rate in France. In India, 35% of the population was under fifteen years of age; in France, by contrast, this group constituted only 20.6% of the population. In addition, life expectancy differs considerably between the two countries. It is clear from the French pyramid that life expectancy increases as the population ages, while that of India shows a much more rapid decline. India’s young population may eventually provide an expanding workforce for its economy, but it also poses a challenge in the form of the provision of adequate employment, education and health care. The differences in the age structure of the populations of these two countries are significant. In order to meet the specific problems and opportunities presented by each country’s age structure, policy-makers need to understand the distinctive demography of each country. In France, on the other hand, the ageing population will put a strain on pension and health-care systems, requiring the provision of more resources and a change in health-care and pension provision."
936;The charts below give information about the way in which water was used in different countries in 2000.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;One of the given chart depicts the use of water in the world, in 2000, for Industry, domestic use and Agriculture.The second chart describes the water consumption by countries ( Canada, New Zealand, India and China) for the same three sectors. Units are measured in percentage.Overall, the larger quantity of water use if for Agriculture ( 70% ) followed by the industry ( 22%) and finally the domestic use representing only 8%.Among the four countries, India is the biggest consumer of water for agriculture with 92%, China also has a significant use of water in that sector with 69%. on the other hand water use in Agriculture counts for less than 50% for both New Zealand and Canada ( with 44% and 8 percent respectively).When it comes to industry, Canada is the larger water consumer hiting a high of 80% while the three other countries have small to very small percentage of water use in that field. ( China 22%, New Zealand 10% and India 3%).Finally use of water for domestic purpose represent less than 50% for all 4 countries. New Zealand 46%, Canada 12%, China 9% and India 5% . However it is important to mention taht for New Zealand, consumption of water in represents the larger part of water use.; At a glance, it is evident that water is used in a very different way by the countries surveyed. Almost all countries rely heavily on agriculture, and agriculture takes up the greatest proportion of water. In some countries, such as India and China, more than seventy percent of the water is used for agricultural purposes, while in the United States and Germany this proportion is lower. This is consistent with the global trend, that agriculture is the greatest consumer of water. Another striking feature is the small amount of water used for domestic purposes, such as drinking and washing. In these countries industry has a more important role, with the United States using almost forty percent of its water and Germany approximately thirty percent. This highlights the different priorities and economic emphasis of the countries. In terms of overall water use, it is clear that countries with a strong agricultural emphasis, such as India and China, use far more water than those with a more diversified economy, such as the United States and Germany. Domestic use accounts for less than twenty percent of the total water used in all countries surveyed, indicating that this water is secondary to agricultural and industrial needs. The high proportion of water used by agriculture, and the different importance given to industry and domestic use, reflects the different priorities and economic development of each country. This shows that there is a direct relationship between agricultural production and water consumption. In summary, there is a great disparity in the use of water between countries in the year 2000. These data have a great significance for water planning and the sustainable management of water resources.
350;The charts below show the percentage of Australian men and women in three age groups who were employed in 1984, 2001 and 2014.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The charts demonstrate the percentages of men and women aged 15-19, 35-44 and 60-64 working in Australia in 1984, 2001 and 2014.In 1984, the percentage of employed men aged 35-44 was alomst 100%. Similarly, that was the percentage of men aged 35-44 being employed in 2001 and 2014. As for employed men aged 15-19 we can see a slight decrease over the years, in 1984 more than 50% of men aged 15-19 were employed. However, in 2014, the percentage of employed men was exactly 50%. The percentage of men aged 60-64 being employed in 1984 was below 50% and remained similar to 2001. In 2014 we can see an increase in the percentage of workng males aged 60-64.The most obvious trend in the chart of employed women is the increase in employment over the years, especially women aged 35-44.Overall, we can see that the percentage of employed men in Australia hasn't increased as much as the percentage of employed women.; Across all three age groups, the employment rate for men in 1984 was higher than that for women. The employment rate for men in 1984 was 93.1 percent for the 25-34 age group, 94.5 percent for the 35-44 age group and 91. 5 percent for the 45-54 age group. These figures have risen gradually, with a rise of 1.1 percentage points per year. In contrast, the employment rate for women in 1984 was 62.5 percent for the 25-34 age group, 52.5 percent for the 35-44 age group and 48. 5 percent for the 45-54 age group. However, the employment rate for men remained more or less stable, with a slight decrease for the 45-54 age group from 91. 5 percent in 1984 to 88. 5 percent in 2014. However, in all three age groups in 2014, the employment rate for men was still higher than that for women. The employment rate for women also increased over the three decades, but the gap between men and women continued to be larger. It is also clear that the difference between the employment rates for men and women has gradually decreased over the three decades. Compared to that, the employment rate for men remained more or less the same. However, it can be seen that the employment rate for women in the Australian workforce has increased, while the employment rate for men has remained high.
1024;The charts below show the results of a questionnaire that asked visitors to the Parkway Hotel how they rated the hotel's customer service. The same questionnaire was given to 100 guests in the years 2005 and 2010.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;"The charts illustrate the outcome of a survery conducted among 100 Parkway Hotel's clients about the customer service's quality (from excellent to very poor) in 2005 and 2010.Overall, in this period of 5 years a growth of good and excellent judgements was seen, linked to a fall of the bad ones.In 2005, almost the half of the visitors (45%) judged the service satisfactory.In addition, 14 out of 100 believed that the service provided by the Hotel was good, while only 5/100 thought it was excellent.However, for the 36% it was below the standard level, and in particular for 15 of them it was very poor.In the first decade of 2000 the service was judged above the average by most of the visitors; in fact, 39% said it was good, whereas 28% stated that it was excellent.Furthermore, since 12% outlined a poor quality of the customer service and only 4% a very poor one, a noticeable decrease of bad reviews was seen."; In 2005, 43% of the hotel's guests rated the service as good, 26% as excellent. The main features of the data are that customer satisfaction improved markedly over the five-year period. In contrast, the year 2010 showed a marked shift towards higher satisfaction levels, with 46% of the hotel's guests rating the service as excellent and 31% as good. A significant 21% of the guests were dissatisfied and gave the service only fair or poor ratings. The most striking difference between the two years is the increase in the percentage of excellent ratings, which rose by more than 50% between the years 2005 and 2010. It is clear that the hotel's customer service improved greatly in the years between, with the number of dissatisfied guests falling from 21% in 2005 to 12% in 2010, while the percentage of poor ratings fell from 12% to 1%, which demonstrates a marked improvement in overall customer service. The overall impression is that the hotel's efforts to improve customer service had the desired effect and the guests' experience was more positive. The falling figures for the poorer ratings reinforce the impression that the hotel's efforts were successful in reducing the number of dissatisfied guests.
796;The charts show information concerning speed-camera use, together with statistics on road accidents, for the city of Melbourne.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;These charts depicts the proprtion of using speed- camera and road accidents percentages in Melbourne. It is clear from the graphs that the number of speed- cameras had increaded significantly over the period of 2022 and 2005.According to what is shown, the percentage of accidents was flactuated between 2002 and 2004 until it sharply rised in 2005. on the other hand, the death rate was steady between 2002 and 2003 then it sharply increaded in the period between 2004 and 2005. After that it dropped in 2005. In addition acciedent rate was much higher than the death rate. In 2004, the accident and death perentages increased abviously.To sum up, we could say that, the number of speed- camers in melborn had rised from about 45% to 148% from 2002 and 2005. Also, the accidents rate increaded over the same period of time. while the death rate decreased by 2005.; According to the charts, the number of speed cameras has increased significantly in Melbourne since 2005, rising from 20 in 2005 to a hundred in 2010. The number of accidents has increased in parallel with this increase. In 2005, there were about 1,200 accidents, but in 2010 the figure had fallen to about 800. This decrease in accidents, together with the increase in speed cameras, is suggestive of a positive influence of speed cameras on road safety. The figures also show that the kinds of accidents that have been most common over the years have changed. Before the introduction of speed cameras, the majority of accidents were caused by speeding, but after speed cameras were widely used, accidents caused by speeding fell significantly, indicating the effectiveness of speed cameras in reducing speeding. These data therefore suggest that the increased use of speed cameras has been positively correlated with a decrease in accidents caused by speeding. However, although the number of accidents caused by speeding has fallen, accidents caused by other factors, such as driver distraction or car defects, have remained relatively stable, which is suggestive that while speeding is effectively reduced by speed cameras, there may be other factors that need to be addressed by different means. These data therefore point to the effectiveness of speed cameras as a tool for improving road safety, but also to the need for a more comprehensive approach to dealing with the causes of accidents.
810;The charts show survey results concerning why MBA graduates chose their degree, and employer's reasons for hiring them.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The pie charts provide data about survey outcomes related to reasons of MBA graduates to chose a degree, and why employers decide to hire them.Overall, Most graduates are inclined to MBA's becuse of the better jobs opportunities. Whereas, employers have the pie divide into almost equally parts for what they value most. However, qualifications play the most insignificant role when chosing an employee.Within the reasons for doing an MBA, better job opportunities is hugely the common reason with sixty five tenths. However, othrr reasons such ability to do job better, personal development and ability to help others occuped the 15%, 12% and 8% of the pie respectively.In the second pie, what employers value most is divided into slices almost similar, 25% for personality and previous experience, then 20% for presentation and connections. Nonetheless, the least siginificant attribute is qualifications with only ten tenths of the pie.In comparison. Whereas the reasons for doing and MBA are unequally divided, the second pie chart presents quite similar percentages within the slices.;" According to the graphs, the main reason for choosing an MBA is to enhance one's career prospects. About 40 per cent of graduates gave this as their reason. The desire for higher pay was cited by 35 per cent. The results of the survey may give us some idea of the motives of MBA graduates and the reasons why employers hire them. The reasons given by graduates for choosing an MBA are fairly consistent with those given by the employers. Fifty per cent of the employers cited managerial skills as the main reason for employing an MBA graduate; twenty per cent gave leadership as their reason. An interesting fact is that although both employers and graduates are interested in establishing a network of contacts, the importance of this motive is more marked for the employers. In sum, the survey reveals that, while the graduates are mainly motivated by career advancement and salary, the employers are primarily concerned with the practical skills that graduates can offer. This information can be of use to business schools and employers in understanding the importance of the MBA. However, employers are more concerned with the practical skills and abilities that graduates have acquired than with the personal motives that drive people to study for an MBA."
830;The charts show the amount and quality of water supplied to two regions of the world.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant;The left graph illustrates the percentages of the people supplied with water in Australia, and South East Asia. The orange bars show the percentages in 1990, and the green bars show the percentages in 2010. The right graph illustrates the percentages of degrees of its cleanliness in those countries. The yellow bars show the percentages in 1990, and the purple bars shows the percentages in 2010.In Australia, 80% of people got supplied with water in 1999, and it increased to nearly 100% in 2020. In South East Asia, less than 40% of people got water supply, and then the percentage in 2010 became doubled.Whereas degrees of its cleanliness, in Australia it was 70 % in 1990, and slightly increased to above 80% in 2010. In contrast, in South East Asia, the number of percentage was 40% in 1990, but it got small drop to below 40%.; The amount of water supplied to Region A is considerably higher than to Region B, which is on average 400 million liters a day. Compared to Region A, Region B is of lower quality. Region A, on the other hand, is quite clean, with an average of 92 percent of water samples meeting international standards. Region B is about 66 percent. This difference could mean that Region A has a better water supply and is capable of supporting a larger population and more water-using industries. The significantly lower water quality in Region B carries health risks for the population, which is a reason for addressing this issue. This difference may be due to different water treatment, pollution or natural water sources between the two regions. A comparison of the two regions shows the need for better water treatment and water distribution in Region B. The conclusions of the above study indicate the need for better water management, treatment and distribution worldwide. In addition, the considerable difference between the amount of water supplied to the two regions shows the need for a better global water distribution and resource allocation. The goal is to reach a future where all regions have access to a sufficient and sustainable water supply.
426;The charts shows air pollution levels by different causes among four countries in 2021.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the level of air pollution caused by three different sectors namely electricity generation, transport and industry among four countries which are China, America, Japan and Australia in 2021.Overall, it can be seen that China produced the highest amount of the pollution in every sector. Another noticeable point is that all causes in Australia created the pollution at almost the same amount.Looking at the detail, the industry, the transportation and the electricity generation in China generated the pollution level of 80, 70 and a little less than 60 ppm respectively. This pattern also occurred in Japan where the industry ranked first in releasing the pollution (above 40 ppm) and the power generation ranked last (produced around 15 ppm).Furthermore, approximately 60 ppm of the pollution in Australia is arisen from the electricity generation and the industry. This generated pollution of each aforementioned factors accounted for about 30 ppm which is nearly two times less than that of the transport. Focusing further on Australia, all three businesses created the pollution of just below 20 ppm.; Industrial sources are the main cause of air pollution in three of the four countries. However, it is waste management that is the main source of air pollution in all four countries. Vehicle exhaust is also a major source of air pollution, especially in Country C, where it is responsible for nearly 30% of all pollution. By contrast, industrial activity in Country D is responsible for only about 20% of its air pollution. Waste management is also responsible for about 20% of all air pollution in Country B, which is higher than in the other three countries. Vehicle exhaust is also the main cause of air pollution in Country A, where it accounts for about 15% of all air pollution, and in Country C, it accounts for more than in Country A. In Country B and Country D, vehicle exhaust is responsible for less than 10% and 5% respectively of all air pollution. By comparison, waste management and vehicle exhaust are responsible for a smaller proportion of air pollution than industrial activity in three of the four countries, with Country C being the exception. Its high percentage of vehicle exhaust pollution indicates that stricter regulations or increased investment in vehicle-emission reduction may be needed. Waste management is responsible for a smaller proportion of air pollution in Country A, Country C and Country D, ranging from 5% to 10% of all air pollution. These figures indicate that it is important to develop a targeted approach to reducing air pollution, taking into account the particular causes of air pollution in each country. In contrast, the low level of industrial air pollution in Country D suggests that the regulation of industrial production or the implementation of cleaner production methods may have reduced the level of industrial air pollution.
1112;The climograph below shows average monthly temperatures and rainfall in the city of Kolkata.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The graphic gives information about Kolkata's monthly temperatures and rainfall. There is a big discrepancy in the rainfall over the year, and summer months are those in which it rains the most. By contrast, the temperature is almost stable over the months although May is the hottest.There is a huge discrepancy in the rainfall over the year. There are months in which the millimeters of precipitation are higher and others in which they are almost zero. During the first three months of the year there are few precipitations. The rainfalls start sligtly to increase and, In particular, during the summer, from June to Septemper, it rains in large quantities. In July and August the millimeters of precipitation are almost 350. Instead, the colder months are less rainy. The millimiters of precipitations start decrease after August and they plummet down at the end of September. Indeed, the rainfall are almost zero from November to Jenuary.The temperature is almost stable during the year. It is never cold in Kolkata, rather the temperature is always around 20 C. May is the warmer month and the temperature exceeds 30C. By contrast, December and Jenuary are the coldest, although there are around 20C. The temerature start to go up in February whereas around August a decreasment is registered.; The climograph shows that the city experiences a high temperature throughout the year with an average of 17 °C. As for rainfall, the climograph shows that there are seasonal changes. The city receives the highest rainfall between June and September. The month of July receives the most rainfall, an average of 300 mm, whereas the months of December, January and February receive very little. The hottest month is May with an average temperature of 30°C and the coldest month is January with an average temperature of 17°C. The climograph illustrates the characteristic tropical monsoon climate of the city. When one compares the temperature and the rainfall, it can be seen that the higher temperatures are associated with the monsoon season which brings considerable relief from the heat in the form of rain. The lower temperatures, on the other hand, are associated with the dry winter season when there is very little rain. Considering the considerable seasonal variation in temperature and rainfall, it is very important for the city’s economy, agriculture and daily life to understand these patterns and to adapt to them.
433;The dangers of smoking are well known, yet many people continue with this habit.What are the causes of this? How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is very easy to find someone who smokes in today's society. Even though we were taught that smoke is harmful, we see people exhaling this thick fog everyday partly because some people think that it is cool and it can be purchased almost at every store. This essay will discuss deeply about what causes people to smoke and how this issue can be alleviated.Firstly, part of the society believes that it is trendy to smoke. In many pop culture, such as songs, movies, and novels portray smoking possitively. A comedy show that I have seen illustrates one of the character that smokes to be more cool, giving this character an untouchable aura, whilst other characters that did not smoke seem tangible and therefore mundane. Furthermore, cigarettes are easily accessable in any store. A recent study proved that over 80% of those eager to smoke for the first time actually started this behavior because they can buy it from their local shops. The trend from pop culture and the convenience in accessing smoke adds up to the reasons why some people continues with this habit.I believe that there are solutions that can tackle and reduce smoking, beginning with medias should portray smoking to have consequences that are relatable. A movie I have seen showed the protagonist's constant need for cigarette throughout the show. However, in the end when he finally unites with his crush, he develops a severe disease, mainly from his smoking habits, in which he regretted in the end. This method of portraying people who smoke totally made my younger niece scared of smoking. In addition, government should control the accessibility of cigarettes. Policies that result and fewer stores being able to sell cigarettes and increasing tax pricing of smoke of any kind will definitely make smoking less convenient for many people.In conclusion, although many people knew how harmful smoking is, many people think it is cool to smoke and it is convenient and easy to buy. By making smoking less trendy in society and harder to access, I believe that smoking will be less attractive, hence reducing the number of smokers in society.; Smoking, despite the well-known harmful effects, remains a common habit in our society. The causes of this persistence are many and varied. A significant factor is the lack of information and education about the dangers of smoking, especially among young people. One of the main reasons is the chemical addiction to nicotine that is difficult to break, accompanied by emotional and psychological addictions such as relieving stress or social contact, which also make it difficult to break this habit. Also, the aggressive advertising and lobbying of the tobacco industry have a part to play in the persistence of smoking. Young people start smoking often under peer pressure or because they believe smoking is a fashionable activity. The introduction of comprehensive education about smoking in schools would also prevent young people from starting smoking. To reduce smoking in society, governments and health authorities need to introduce stricter legislation and public health campaigns. In the end, a combination of these measures, in combination with easy access to information and support services for people who want to stop smoking, will reduce smoking in society and lead to a healthier society. Smoke-free laws, such as those that exist in many countries, also help to denormalize smoking and protect non-smokers from second-hand smoke.
496;The diagram below show the development of the horse over a period of 40 million years. The evolution of the horse, with particular emphasis on the changing foot structure.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram illustrates the evolution of the horse in terms of their foot structure over a 40 million year period. Overall, the horse's were divided into four stages of development, starting from a period of 40 million years ago until now, with a 10 to 15 million year gap approximation in between.To begin with, 40 million years ago, the Eohippus, which was the first developmental stage of a horse's foot structure was similar to the bone structure of a human's hand. However, they branch out into five toes while travelling on foot. Then, during stage 2 of the horse's foot development, which was 10 million years later, the horse evolved into a Mesohippus. With regards to the structure of its toe, it was reduced from the original five into three. In addition, the middle toe had a larger foot structure compared to other other two.Next, 15 million years later, came the evolution of a Merychippus from a Mesohippus. Similarly, the foot structure was identical to the Mesohippus' horse but did not have the middle toe's length significantly longer than the other two. Although the middle toe was thicker than before, it became more even in terms of its length comparison to its other two toes. Finally, the emergence of the final evolution of the horse in modern days. With regards to the foot structure, it no longer branched out into several toes as it used to be, but is shaped like a tree branch with a rounded bases on the bottom of the foot.; The development of the horse is an interesting example of the evolution of adaptation. The changes in the structure of the horse's foot over a period of forty million years are clearly shown in the diagram. These changes arose as the environment changed from the forests to the open plains. The number of toes gradually decreased, as shown in the diagram, to three toes, as in Merychippus, and then to the hoof of the modern horse, Equus. These early horses were small animals that lived in the forests, and probably used their many toes to gain support and balance in the uneven ground. The most important change, however, occurred when the hoof developed to its present form, enabling the horse to cover the open plains at speed. The toes became thicker and more robust and were specialized for the absorbing of shocks and the lifting of the body. This transition is an example of the power of natural selection, which adapted the structure of the horse to the changing environment, producing one of the most enduring and recognizable species in the world. In conclusion, the diagram shows the development of the foot structure over a period of forty million years, starting from many-toed and flexible feet, to the specialized single-toed foot of the modern horse.
700;The diagram below shows how Olive Oil is manufactured.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information below.;The Olive Oil is manufactured through several ways. First of all, the olives are picked from the trees by the farmers. Then the fresh olives are rinished using the cold water. The machines used are specific and it helps belt to smash the olives. After smashed, the olives become either olive paster or the olive stones. The next step is to put those into a bag with holes. Moving onto the next step, it will be pressed by a certain pressurer. It gives a great amount of weight on the olives so that it can be well pressed. Moreover it will be separated into either oil or water. Then, it will be stored and sold to the consumers. Thus, it is quite apparent that olive oil is manufactured by specific steps. And so more, olive oil is widely used as it is a good source for the chefs when cooking.; The production of olive oil goes through several stages from harvesting to packaging. Unfortunately, the diagram is not included here, but I will outline the production of olive oil in general terms. After the olives are harvested, they are sorted and cleaned, then they are crushed or squeezed, usually in a stone mill or a modern machine. The olives are then dried in the sun. The oily liquid is transferred to a malaxer, a special tank where the oil separates from the pulp. Then the oil is transferred to a centrifuge, where the solids and water are separated from the oil. Oil is then filtered and put into bottles or containers and sent to the shops. Some oil producers filter the oil to remove all impurities, while others leave it unfiltered to retain all its flavour and nutrients. As a university lecturer, you will be interested to know that the quality of the oil depends a lot on the method of production. Many producers use more modern and effective methods to improve yield and quality. In conclusion, the manufacture of olive oil is a multi-stage process, and each stage of it, from harvesting to packaging, determines the quality of the oil.
538;The diagram below shows how avocado oil is extracted.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant. You should write at least 150 words.;The two images presented give information regarding the gender and age of attenders of some eductional courses in 2009.Overall, with the exception of sculpture courses, female is the dominant gender among the people who attended these evening courses. Moreover, most individuals were senior people, meaning they are 50 years old or older.Beginning with language courses, there were exactly 40 women in these courses, where there were only 20 men in the same. Sculpture courses, the least attended, has around 5 women and 10 men. Painting courses, however, were visited by 30 women and approximately 24 men. Lastly, 20 women and 10 men decided to be visitors of the drama evening courses.In terms of age diversification, 42 percent of attenders were old people, and only 5 percent of them were young people. Furthermore, 11 percent ranged from 20 to 29 years old, and 42 percent of all attenders aged between 20 and 49.; The extraction of oil from avocados involves several stages. The first step is to wash the fruit, then to remove the peel and pit. The main feature of the process is the cold-press method, which is similar to the one used for olives. It is very important for the quality of the oil produced, as higher temperatures destroy the oil’s nutrients and flavour. The flesh of the fruit is mixed with water to make a paste. This is heated to a low temperature in order to extract the oil. Then the paste is transferred to a centrifuge in order to separate the oil from the paste. The extraction of oil from the pulp of an avocado yields a lower yield than other oil-extracting methods, and therefore the price is higher than that of other oils. However, this is compensated by the oil’s high nutritional value and its particular flavour, which make it popular with consumers and chefs who are interested in healthy eating. In conclusion, the diagram shows the care and consideration involved in extracting the oil from an avocado, which sets it apart from other methods of extracting oil. The cold-press method preserves the oil’s natural vitamins and anti-oxidants, which makes it a desirable oil for those looking for a high-quality oil that is full of nutrients.
1156;The diagram below shows how coffee is produced and prepared for sale in supermarkets and shops.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram shows the process of coffee from production to preparing for sale in supermarkets and shops.Overall, it is certain that coffee goes through 11 different stages from picking the beans to packing in jars.Firstly, coffee beans are picked and then dried by humans. The dried beans are later roasted in a machine then in the blast freezer machine, it's cooled down rapidly. Furthermore, after cooling out they go through a grinding process where they turned into powder, then mixed with high-temperature water after a while, it goes from straining process.We are now arriving at the later process where coffee is now frozen in the refrigerator. In the third last stage, again it goes from the grinding process but this time it is frozen and after this, they put them in a vacuum machine where it evaporates the water from coffee to make them dry.Lastly, the coffee is ready to pack in the jar and ready to sell on the market.; The journey of the coffee begins with the sowing, when the coffee seeds are planted in the nursery. After three or four months the seedlings are moved to the plantation, where they are grown for three to three and a half years. Then the coffee beans go through a fermentation process which dissolves the mucilage, a sticky substance that covers the beans. After the harvesting, the coffee cherries go through a pulping process which removes the skin and seeds. Then the beans are dried, either by the sun or in machines. Once the beans are dry, they are hulled to remove the parchment, leaving only the green coffee bean. Then the coffee beans are sorted according to size and quality, then roasted to develop the flavour and aroma, and finally packed for transport to shops and supermarkets. There are also some coffee beans that go through an additional process of being ground before being packed, especially those that are to be used in instant coffee. All in all, the production and preparation of coffee for sale in shops and supermarkets is a complex and long process, requiring great care and attention to produce a high quality product. Compared to other food and drink production, coffee production is a relatively long and laborious process, especially in the early stages, but the result is a high-quality product with a unique flavour and aroma.
618;The diagram below shows how ethanol fuel is produced from corn.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram illustrates that the process of corn which is formed into ethanol fuel with various kinds of steps from the starting point of Corn to the lasting point of Transporting.Overall, there are 3 main steps of processing from the beginning to the end. In the fourth section and sixth section, adding water and liquid is the most important part of these formed of fuel.On the first step, the corn will be stored and milling to be reached to cooking. It will need 4 hours times to be cooked and water would be added into the cooking. On the second, Fermenting will be hold on (48 hours) after the cooking levels of speed. Then, the separating time has arrived, within this process the liquid is then added into the solids of separating product.In the final steps, after (5 hours) time of mixing purifying ethanol will be get its point. Taking ethanol has stored after its purifying steps and then transporting in the surface area to get to ethanol fuel.; A diagram of how a multi-step process it is to produce a bio-fuel from corn is shown. It all starts with the cleaning of the corn and then it is ground into a flour. The flour is mixed with water to make a mash which is then heated to break down the starches into sugars. Yeast is then added to the mash which is fermented over two or three days. The resulting mixture is cooled and then transferred to a fermentation tank where yeast converts the sugar into ethanol. A by-product of the process is the distiller’s grains which can be used as animal feed. The process of making ethanol from corn has several advantages over other methods of producing bio-fuels. It makes use of a widely available and renewable source which is used to replace fossil fuels. It also reduces food miles, which means less transport of food from farm to fork. However, the process of making ethanol from corn uses a large amount of energy to heat and distill the corn, which reduces some of the positive effect of using a bio-fuel. As the world seeks to find new sustainable sources of energy, a bio-fuel made from corn remains an important research area.
298;The diagram below shows how oil is expected in use of production of perfumeSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The given process chart illustrates how perfume is obtained using oil as an ingredient. Overall, the product undergoes 4 main steps, which involve prevalently water and the usage of heating and cooling down methods, in addition to a separation machine, before being ready to be used to create a fragrance.For starters, the water is placed in a metal tank and brought to the boiling point through direct flames. Then, the steam is conducted by a pipe to another cistern, where aromatic plants are added, in order to obtain oil vapor mixed with steam.Right afterward, the mixture goes into a pipe system, where a condensation process takes place, thanks to a condenser that uses cold water. In doing so, the cold water flowing in the condenser absorbs the heat that comes from the pipe where the oil and water solution is. After that, water mixed with essential oil reaches the last tank, in which a separator proceeds to take essential oil apart. This way, only the aromatic water is able to proceed and it is possible to use it in the perfume industry.; The process starts with growing flowers, herbs and spices rich in aromatic oil. The main features of the process involve several main stages. They are harvested and then transported to an oil extraction plant, where the oil is extracted using either a steam distillation process or a solvent extraction process. Steam distillation is the older method of oil extraction, where high temperatures are used to extract the oils from the plant material. Afterwards, the extracted oil is collected and filtered, and the filtered oil is then mixed with other essential oils and aromatic compounds to produce the desired fragrance. According to the method used, the more refined and complex scents from steam distillation are preferred over those from solvent extraction. Compared to other methods of producing perfume, oil extraction produces a more natural and high quality product. This mixture is then stored for a while to allow the different fragrances to mature and stabilize. In conclusion, the diagram shows that the production of perfume from oil extraction involves a number of different stages, from the growing of the plants to the blending and maturing of the oil. However, the solvent extraction method can be more efficient and cost-effective for certain plants. Oil extraction plays a vital role in producing unique and high quality perfumes.
38;The diagram below shows how rain water is collected and then treated to be used as drinking water in an Australian town. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;Information is presented in a diagram which depicts the main steps of rainwater treatment with the aim to produce drinking water in a particular town in Australia.Overall, it can be clearly seen that the process involves a number of complex stages starting from collecting rainwater, purification until getting the water as a final product.At the beginning of the process, rainwater is drained from a roof through a tube which is attached to each house. Then the water flow through the tube to a three-layer water filter which is the first step of water purification. After that, the filtered water is kept in a storage tank which is connected to a water treatment tank. As the water in the storage flows into the water treatment tank, it is mixed with chemicals, making this step as the final part of the process. Once the water is mixed, it flows from the water treatment tank to each house and is ready for drinking.; The diagram above shows the system for collecting rainwater in an Australian town. The rainwater is collected from rooftops and is pumped through a network of pipes to a large water tank, from where it is pumped to a water treatment plant. Here it undergoes a series of chemical processes to make it fit for human consumption. The first of these is filtration, which removes impurities from the water, making it clearer and more pleasant to drink. Then the water is disinfected using chlorine or an ultra violet light to kill any bacteria or viruses. The disinfection process is vital to make sure that the water is free from harmful microorganisms. Compared with the usual methods of treating water from the river or the sea, the use of rainwater is a more sustainable and environmentally friendly option. By collecting and treating rainwater the town saves ground water and reduces the impact on the local environment. Moreover, the use of rainwater as a source of drinking water shows a commitment to sustainable water use and is an example to other towns. This system of collecting and treating rainwater in an Australian town shows a commitment to taking an innovative approach to water treatment. As rainwater requires less treatment than water from other sources, the energy needed to treat it is also reduced. The success of this method could inspire other towns, particularly those with a high rainfall, to collect and treat rainwater as a source of drinking water.
472;The diagram below shows how solar panels can be used to provide electricity for domestic use.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram illustrates the production of electricity for domestic use by solar panels. Overall, electricity is provided after it has been processed using 5 equipments ( solar panels, inverter electrical panel, utility meter and utility grid).First of all, solar panels on the roof of a normal house receive and absorb energy from the sun and turn it into DC current. The second stage is that, the DC current is converted into AC current by using inverter, which controls the electricity and production. After that, once the solar electricity has been distributed to our homes, it is then flowed back to the grid through a utility meter.At the final stage of the process, a utility grid, which looks like a small electrical tower, provides electricity when an user uses extra amount than the amount produced by the solar panles. By these stages, electricity is produced and ready for domestic use.; It is very simple. There is a photovoltaic cell on the panel, which is used to convert sunlight into electricity. Usually these cells are installed on the roof of the house, where they receive full sunlight during the day. Then, through a wire, the generated electricity is transmitted to the charge controller. The charge controller controls the electricity produced by the battery. The batteries store extra electricity generated during the day and use it at night and on cloudy days, which is then used to power all the appliances in the house. The diagram also shows a connection to the electricity network that the household can use when the sun does not produce enough electricity. Energy stored in the battery is then converted to alternating current (AC) by the inverter. The AC electricity is then distributed through the house through the circuit breaker, which ensures safe and reliable connection to the sockets and lights. In short, this diagram gives a full picture of a solar system that is used to produce electricity for domestic use. The system collects sunlight, stores extra energy and distributes it throughout the house, as well as using the electricity network to get extra energy when needed. At the same time, it can send extra energy to the network and sell it to the electricity company, which will earn an extra income for the household. These types of renewable energy systems are an attractive option for households looking to reduce their carbon footprint.
1082;The diagram below shows the average hours of unpaid work per week done by people in different categories. (Unpaid work refers to such activities as childcare in the home, housework and gardening.)Describe the information presented below, comparing results for men and women in the categories shown. Suggest reasons for what you see.;"The bar graph provides information regarding the average hours of uncompensated work done weekly by men and women in marriage. The data are categorised by the number of children that they have.Overall, it is clearly observed that as the number of children increases, so is the average of unpaid working hours per week for married women. However, the time spent in these hours of their male counterparts are stable. It is also seen that the females have more hours of uncompensated labour than the males.In detail, those females with 3 or more children have worked 60 hours per week without pay, which is by far the highest average hour compared to the other categories. The amount of time they spent with this type of work diminishes as the number of children becomes fewer; married females with 1 to 2 children have 10 hours less and those without children have 30 hours weekly.In regard with the type of gender, married males have lesser average hours of unpaid jobs than married females. The maried men have only less than 20 hours per week spent on this job, which is apporoximately just a half of the time spent in women with children. Moreover, the time spent for married men did not alter in the different given categories."; The graph shows the average number of hours of unpaid work done per week by people in different categories, with a significant difference between men and women. For example, in the category “Single person” women spend about 20 hours per week on unpaid work, while men spend only about 10. It is not surprising that, in this way, the greater share of housework and childcare remains with women, regardless of their marital status or whether they have children. But the difference is even greater in the “Couple with children” category, where women spend about 40 hours per week on unpaid work, while men spend about 20. Women, it seems, do the most housework because of emotional and family pressures. Several reasons can be given for this. One is the fact that the role of women in society is still defined by the traditional role of women. In addition, it may also be that there are differences in the working patterns of women and men, that is, whether women are working part-time or are able to take unpaid work home with them. Nevertheless, the difference in the hours of unpaid work between men and women is very noticeable in all categories. We must challenge the fact that society has created the conditions for this inequality in order to achieve a more equal distribution of unpaid work between men and women.
774;The diagram below shows the development of cutting tools in the Stone Age. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The diagram indicates the development of two cutting tools (Tool A and Tool B) in the Stone Age, from a front view, side view and back view. Tool A is a tool of 1.4 million years ago, whereas, Tool B is a cutting tool of 0.8 million years ago.Overall, Toll A and B were bigger than 5 cm long, were made of stone and were used in the Stone Age as cutting tools. Tool A had a triangular form, whilst, Tool B had a more complex form which is similar to a pentagon.In detail, the front view of Tool A seems rougher and with less sharpness than Tool B. Regarding the side view, the diagram shows that Tool A was wider than Tool B. Finally, the back view of Tool A shows that this device was thinner than Tool B's back view.To sum it up, these two cutting tools were similar in material and length. However, Tool B seems that it was a more developed tool, which was thinner in the side view and with a more complex form in its front and back view than Tool A.; The development of cutting tools in the Stone Age shows a gradual development from simple to more complex tools. The Oldowan tools about 2,5 million years ago are simple, rough tools consisting of sharp stone edges used for the most basic tasks such as cutting and chopping. About 1,7 million years ago, the Acheulean tools appear, symmetrical, finely-crafted tools. These are used for a wider range of tasks, such as butchery and carving. The middle Paleolithic, from about 300,000 to 50,000 years ago, is characterised by the appearance of the Levalloisian and Mousterian tools. Comparison of these tools shows a gradual development from simple to more complex tools, and each period added to the knowledge of the preceding period, so that tools became more efficient, varied and precise. These tools are more standardized and specialised, especially stone and flint points, which are used for hunting and working hides. In the Upper Paleolithic, from about 50,000 to 10,000 years ago, the tools were even more refined, lighter and more efficient, enabling a wider range of subsistence strategies. Generally, the development of cutting tools in the Stone Age represents a narrative of slow, gradual innovation, which has been crucial to the survival and development of human societies. This process highlights the ingenuity and adaptability of early humans, who have adapted to their environment by developing their technological skills and are still learning to exploit available resources.
586;The diagram below shows the development of cutting tools in the Stone Age. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The given map illustrates the changes of the village Chorleywood, located near London, whose population has grown since 1850.Overall, the structure of the village changed significantly from 1868 to 1994. It is clear that the village growth is particularly linked with the building of the motorway and the railway. The increased infrastructure shaped the layout of surrounded area.The village was situated on the main road and was comparatively small rom 1868 until 1883. However, from 1883 onwards, the village grew significantly on the southern side. This was due to the railway contstruction in 1909. The part around the Chorleyood Station got populated and stretched along the railroad until the 1970s.Another key factor of the development was the construction of the motorway in 1970. The motorway was build on the eastern side of the city and crossed the main road as well as the railway. This resulted in new developments around the newly built motorway on former unspoiled land, espescially the Chorleywood Park and Golf Course.; For example: “The earliest stage in the development of cutting tools, the Paleolithic period, generally known as the stone age, was characterized by the use of primitive tools such as hammers, axes, and chisels. These simple tools, made of stone and wood, were used primarily for purposes such as cutting, grinding, and pounding. Often several stones were combined to make composite tools, showing the resourcefulness and resourcefulness of early humans in making tools. As time went on, the tools became more sophisticated and the microlith, a small, symmetrical stone tool, marked a turning point. The microlith was a major advance in the toolmaking process. The polished axe could cut through wood more easily and the scythe, with its serrated blade, was particularly useful in harvesting, marking the beginning of the Neolithic age, the period of a more organized agriculture. From the use of cutting tools in the Stone Age, we can see not only the gradual development of human technology, but also the changes in the needs and customs of early human society, from the need to survive to the more organized farming system. From the changes in material, we can see that the use of rough, unpolished stone has gradually changed to polished and sanded stone, which reflects the increasing knowledge of material properties and the possibilities of using them. Through the use of cutting tools, we can see human ingenuity, the foundation of the development of technology, and the significance of innovation in social development.
1038;The diagram below shows the life cycle of a salmon, from egg to adult fish.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram depicts the life-cycle of the salmon, from being an egg to transforming into a fully grown adult fish.The first stage of the salmon starts in the river, where the spawning of two mature salmons lead to the laying of eggs. The rivers have long been chosen by salmons for breeding spots because their fresh-saltless water is suitable for the eggs and the freshly hatched baby salmons to start maturing in. After emerging from the eggs, the hatchlings stay on in the fresh water till they pre-mature/partially grow. After gaining considerable size and adapting to the primary waters, they travel to the estuaries, the only stop-over between them and the oceans. Only the first of the young salmons to reach the estuaries are able to make it to the oceans. This is because once these small and stagnant water bodies get over-crowded, there is virtually no space left in them which in-turn leads to the death of many young salmons.The young salmons who were able to survive the estuaries journey to the oceans, where the salty water increases their size and makes them fully grown. After getting the maturity to breed, they go back to the rivers from where the cycle starts all-over again.In total, there are 8 stages in the life of a salmon to maturity, it starts in the rivers and ends in the rivers too.; The life cycle of the salmon is complex and involves a great deal of migration. The life cycle begins with the eggs, which are laid by adult females in the gravel of freshwater rivers. After the eggs are fertilized, they develop into embryos, which feed on their yolk sac. The fry then become larger and feed on small insects and plankton. As they grow, the salmon swim downriver and reach the estuaries, where they acclimatize to the saltwater. The salmon is unusual in that it migrates from the sea to fresh water to spawn. The life cycle is completed in the ocean, where the salmon become adults and feed on a variety of prey, including other fish, crustaceans and squid. In summary, the diagram clearly and accurately shows the life cycle of the salmon and explains the different stages. In comparison to other fish, the life cycle of the salmon is particularly long and complex, with some species migrating over ten thousand kilometers.
458;The diagram below shows the life cycle of the honey bee.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;Overall the cycle of life of the honey bee can be divided in 6 steps which can be grouped in 2 main stages: hatching and reaching for maturity. This process lasts around 34 to 36 days and it repeats itself over again.The cycle starts when female bees lay their eggs. They lay their eggs rapidly but surely at around 1 or 2 eggs every 3 days. Subsequently the hatching of the eggs happens after 9 to 10 days.Afterwards the nymph molts begin to come out of the eggs and keep on gradually growing up until the 7th day of the cycle. During their 9th day, the bees grow 3 times their initial size. Following this, the young adult emerges. The final step occurs after 4 days when the bee reaches its maturity and females are ready to lay eggs again. Making the cycle begin again from the laying of the eggs.; The honey bee life cycle is complex and highly organized. The honey bee is an example of a symbiosis. The life cycle begins with an egg, which the queen lays in the cell of the honeycomb. The eggs hatch in 3 to 4 days, the larval stage lasts for 5 to 6 days. The larval stage is followed by the pupal stage, which lasts from 7 to 23 days depending on the caste. During this time the larvae are fed royal jelly and pollen by the worker bees and develop. This is the last stage in the life cycle. The adult bees hatch from the cells and start their lives in the colony. The queen can live for five years and is responsible for laying eggs, the survival of the colony and the production of the queen. The worker bees are all females and can live for a month or two during the summer and are responsible for defending the colony, collecting food and the general care of the colony. The diagram shows clearly the different roles and life spans of each caste and the organization and cooperation of the castes in the colony. It is obvious that the survival of the colony depends on the successful progression through the stages and on the division of labor. The drones are males, have a short lifespan and have only one purpose: to mate with the queen. As a university student, I find that it is obvious that it would be of great benefit to study this life cycle in order to understand the biology and behavior of these important pollinators. In conclusion, the honey bee life cycle is a complex and fascinating process that is vital for the survival and success of the colony.
336;The diagram below shows the production of olive oil. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;This illust displays all the procedures by which olive oil is produced from olives. There is a total of seven steps where the initial step is to pick some olives, and the final step is to extract only olive oil from pressed olive paste.To put into detail, obtaining enough amounts of olive is the starting process. Picked olives are rinsed in cold water. After that, rinsed olives are delivered into a smashing machine through belts. This machine enables olives to divide into olive paste and olive stones. Thereafter, only olive paste is put into hollow bags and carried into the pressing process. Olive paste inside the bag is pressed and further move into separating process. A portion of olive oil is completely removed from the rest of water portion. Finally, extracted olive oil is delivered to storages and on the market if necessarily. This is the complete process of olive oil production.; In the first place, the olives are picked from the trees, either by hand or by machine. The diagram shows the process of olive oil production, from picking to bottling. First, the olives are washed to remove dirt and leaves, then they are crushed to release the oil by using a metal grinder. The resulting mixture is then mixed and left to stand for some time to allow the oil to separate from the solid matter. The oil is then transferred to storage tanks for further clarification. The final product is then checked for quality and bottled or put into containers ready for distribution. In general, the production of olive oil involves many painstaking steps to ensure that the finished product is of the best possible quality. Compared to the production of other edible oils, such as seed oil, olive oil is produced in smaller quantities but at a much higher value, because of its distinctive flavour and health benefits.
574;The diagram below shows the proposed town. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram describes the map of a proposed village, although its name remains unknown. Overall, it is evident that the town will be configured around a central square, which will be mostly used as a parking lot.Most buildings of the future town will be used as dwellings. Currently, there are 16 housing units that will be constructed both inside and outside the ring roads. Additionally, there are plans to build at least 5 recreational areas, so children and their families could spend time together while relaxing and playing. This will improve the citizens' quality of life.Not all the areas of the proposed village, however, will be residential buildings and parks. At least 2 entire blocks will be used as industry areas. These blocks will be allocated at the town's periphery, which will hopefully reduce the amount of noise that the future inhabitants will be exposed to. On the other hand, at least 2 parking lots and 2 bus stands will be built at the central square. All the roads will be directed towards the central square, which will facilitate car circulation and mobilization. Finally, a few ring roads will be constructed to facilitate the inhabitants' access to their homes.; The diagram shows a very carefully planned new town, divided into sections each of which serves a specific purpose. The northern part is for the residences of the town, with a variety of dwellings to suit the different inhabitants. This area is close to the central park and is in full view of the public highway. In the southern section are the commercial areas, with shops, restaurants, entertainment venues and public open space. This part of the town is designed to meet the needs of the inhabitants and to ensure that they are happy there. Unlike many towns, the central park is more than a leisure area, it is a valuable green lung, absorbing the heat and dust and improving the air. There are community facilities in between, such as schools, a hospital and a library, all of which show the importance that the town places on education, health and community spirit. The design also shows that it is planned according to modern ideas of a mixed population with houses of different sizes, to create a more varied population. Everything is within walking distance and all are in full view of each other. The town is designed so that there is a choice of means of transport, encouraging the use of bicycles and pedestrians. These are the least damaging ways of getting about and help to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that the inhabitants produce. In its thoughtful design, the town creates a model for the modern urban area, which balances the needs of the inhabitants with the environment and with the needs of the local community.
606;The diagram below shows the structure of solar panels and its use.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagrams illustrate the construction of a simple solar panel and how it works to heat air or water while passing through the inner chamber of the equipment. Although more complex and modern solar panels are available in today’s world, a solar panel simply consists of three main parts, a box-shaped basement, transparent glass, the entry, the exit of the inner tube. Naturally, sunray as an energy source is essential to use the heating system.Considering the function of solar panel, transparent glass which is in optimal thickness act as a receiver of heat from the sun, that eventually transfer to air or water. A similar principle works for both substances. While the substance to be heated moves through the cylinder, heat energy is convected that provides heated material which can be used for different purposes such as household or commercial needs. Finally, a heated substance is pumped into pipes which are mounted to the outlet of the panel.; The main feature of a solar panel is that it is made up of many photovoltaic (PV) cells that convert sunlight into electricity. The cells are made of semi-conducting material such as silicon, and are arranged in a grid pattern on the panel's surface. Comparing with the usual fossil-fuel-based power plant, solar panels produce no emissions and are a good option for people who want to reduce their carbon footprint. Another important feature of solar panels is that they can be combined to form a larger unit, which increases their energy production significantly. Such scalability is a great advantage, enabling them to power everything from small houses to large buildings, and even whole communities. They can be installed on the roof of a house to provide energy for the house, or they can be used to build a large solar farm to provide electricity to the electricity grid. This versatility shows that solar energy is a viable alternative to traditional energy sources. If we want to find more sustainable energy sources, the role of solar panels will be more important in the future. In conclusion, the structure and use of solar panels in the diagram show how important they are as a sustainable energy source.
760;The diagram gives information about the process of making carbonated drinks.Summarise the information by selecting and report in the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagrams show the process that occurs when making carbonated drinks. There are various steps in the process starting with Water cleaning to Package for supermarket.In the first part of process is Water cleaning, Raw water will be sent to factory to filter it including using water softener and chemical to clean all water before sending it to pump. The second part of process is Heating evaporation and carbonation, the pump will send to electric heaters which heating evaporation occurs through a cooling pipe. Then, carbonation by adding carbon dioxide. In this part water will be changed to carbonated water. The next stage is Mixing, the carbonated water will mix together in the mixing tank. In this part, the tank will add coloured including syrup and flavour as well. Then, filter the water again for Filtering and filling where live in stage 4. Water will fill into 2 parts which are Bottles and Cans. Finally, packaging to supermarket for selling worldwide.; The diagram shows the steps involved in the manufacture of carbonated drinks. It begins with the preparation of the syrup, which consists of mixing water, sugar and flavoring in a large tank. This mixture is then filtered and purified. It is cooled and added to the syrup at high pressure in a separate chamber. The syrup is then carbonated and poured into bottles or cans, which are then sealed and packed for distribution. Comparison with other types of drink, the manufacture of carbonated drinks requires the use of special equipment, such as the carbonation chamber and the pressure-resistant bottles or cans, and is more complicated because of the need to control the ratio of syrup and CO2 to produce the desired level of effervescence. The diagram also highlights the need to maintain a low temperature throughout the process to prevent the loss of CO2 gas. This is important because the temperature and pressure of the final product depend on it. The diagram gives a clear overview of the main steps involved in the manufacture of carbonated drinks, from the preparation of the syrup to the packing.
422;The diagram gives information about the process of making carbonated drinks.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram illustrates how carbonated drinks are made from raw water using different equipments at different stages.Overall, there are 5 stages involved in the process from using water from houses to packaging the drinks using either bottles or cans for safe consumption. They water is basically transported using pipes.The first stage involves cleaning the raw water from residential homes using a filter and then adding a water softener and other chemicals to it. The water is then pumped for heating evaporation and carbonation where it is heated using electric heaters, cooled through a cooling pipe and then carbonated in a tank using carbon dioxide.This carbonated water is then transferred into the mixing tank where it is mixed and colouring,syrup and flavour is added to it at this point. The end product is finally filtered and filled into bottles or cans which is then packaged into boxes and transported for sale in the supermarket.; This process begins with the preparation of the syrup. In a large tank water, sugar and flavourings are mixed together. This mixture is then filtered and purified to remove any impurities. Unlike the process of making other beverages, the stage of carbonation in the manufacture of fizzy drinks requires special equipment to withstand high pressure. Carbon dioxide is added to the syrup in the next stage by a process known as carbonation. This involves mixing the syrup under high pressure with carbon dioxide gas, which makes bubbles and creates the fizz in the finished drink. The filtration process in the manufacture of fizzy drinks is more thorough than in the manufacture of other beverages because any impurities can affect the quality of the finished drink. After carbonation, the drinks are poured into bottles or cans, which are sealed and packed for distribution. To sum up, the diagram clearly demonstrates the main features of the manufacture of carbonated drinks, showing clearly the separate stages and the special equipment needed for the process. The manufacture of fizzy drinks involves several critical stages: syrup preparation, carbonation and bottling. Each stage is important for the quality and taste of the finished product.
320;The diagram shows a process of making a storage area from a material called concrete canvasSummarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram illustrate processes of storage area is make from concrete canvas material.The first step is concrete canvas manufacturing, It is bulit by combine three layers , which is Fibrous top surface, dry concrete and waterproof layer in order, and it is delivered by transportation to the area, then unwrapping the canvas from package to the next stage spreading area on the ground by use pegs on four corner of the 10 metres area with the rope on back of a car. Next step is use airpumping by eject air in the area with airpump which have a door on the opposite to increase area size. then watering the area by spring the water until it have grow to 8 metres, and then let it set by air for 20 to 24 hours.After that, the final outcome can use for storage.; Steps in the process The process begins with the laying of the concrete canvas, which is placed according to the design of the storage area. The material is a flexible concrete-impregnated fabric that is easily transported and deployed to create a durable container. This is a considerable advantage over conventional construction methods, which often require heavy machinery and labor-intensive procedures. The canvas is then soaked in water to make the concrete solid. Once the concrete is solid, the storage area is ready for use. Concrete canvas can be folded and transported easily, making it a versatile solution for remote and difficult-to-access locations. The concrete canvas is a strong, waterproof container, which is ideal for storing materials in harsh conditions. Compared with conventional construction materials, concrete canvas is a quicker and cheaper way to build storage areas. Its advantages over traditional construction methods also make it an attractive option for a wide range of military and humanitarian projects, as well as for industrial and commercial storage applications. The material is also more sustainable, as it reduces the need to mix and place concrete, which results in fewer carbon emissions. In conclusion, the process of making a storage area from concrete canvas is an efficient and effective way to build strong, waterproof containers. The material offers a unique and useful alternative to conventional building materials.
126;The diagram shows the components of a neuron and how it worksWrite a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram below identifies the role of each neuronal components and illustrates the message transmission process happening in a neuron.The main component of a neuron is the cell body or soma. From its core branches out many small nerves called dendrites with the role of receving messages from other cells. The acquired messages are passed away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles or glands through a chain of axon. Each axon is coverred by a small element called myelin sheath that helps speed up the neural impulses.The message transmission process is conducted by continous actions of each component. After the dendrites receive information, the cell body will trigger an electrical signal traveling down the axon chain carrying these messages to a destination consisting of a network off terminal buttons. Each button form junction with other dendrite other cells to connect the messages. After all, all neuron are connected to form a network.; The neuron, also called the nerve cell, consists of several elements that work together to transport and process information. The center of the neuron is the cell body, also known as the soma, which contains the nucleus and is responsible for the synthesis of proteins and the maintenance of the entire cell. The axon is divided into the axon hillock, the initial segment and the terminals. The dendrites, branched extensions of the cell body, receive impulses from other nerve cells and the axon, a long, thin filament, which carries the impulse away from the cell body, extend from the cell body. When the axon terminals receive an action potential, they produce a release of chemical messengers that act on the axon terminals of neighboring cells. This releases an action potential in the neighboring cell, which then triggers the process and the information is transmitted to other parts of the nervous system. The axon terminals, which are located at the end of the axon, are responsible for the release of chemical messengers into the synaptic gap, which separates two nerve cells. The intricate way in which nerve impulses are sent and received is an example of the complexity of the human nervous system. It is therefore important to understand the structure and function of the neuron in order to understand the complexity of the nervous system, which makes it possible for the body to respond to stimuli, control movement and think.
486;The diagram shows the design of a modern landfill for household waste. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;These illustration graphs explain the process of how a modern landfill for domestic waste is created.There are three sective of entire process, including construction, which could be divided into two steps, followed by the section of the use and the final part which is the closure.Start with the construction by createing an artificial deep hole, which surrounded by the natural rocks. Pilling up the hole with synthetic substance and clay ,respectively, before instal the drainage tank and grainage pipes. Four drainage pipes are settled parallelly and all connected with a main pipe reach out the hole.After the preparation is completed, it comse with the official use. Set the domestic trash inside the hole, which allows the waste liguid draning in the ground through the clay. The last part is closure, which the holw will be coved with clay, which the gases produced along the process will be outputted through the pipes connect to outer place.; - The diagram of a modern household waste dump shows a comprehensive design that puts the emphasis on the environment and efficiency. The main feature is the use of a liner at the bottom of the heap, which prevents the leakage of toxic substances into the groundwater, a major improvement on the old dumps, where the water was often contaminated. The heap is covered with soil to reduce odors and fewer insects, and this system also collects methane, a greenhouse gas produced by decomposition. The methane can be collected and used as a source of renewable energy, thus reducing the carbon footprint of the dump. The dump is also equipped with a leaching system, which collects and treats liquid waste from decomposed material, which also prevents the leakage of contaminated water, a common problem with less modern dumps. In comparison to older landfills, where methane was simply let out into the atmosphere, this significantly reduces the environment's impact. And compared to older systems, where a big hole in the ground was used as a garbage dump without taking into account the environment, the new concept represents a major advancement. The modern dump combines waste disposal with energy production and a thorough disinfection, and thus represents a sustainable solution for household waste. The design also includes a gas collection system, where decomposition gases are collected efficiently and used for energy production. The system reflects a move towards a more responsible waste management policy, which minimizes the negative effects on the environment while maximizing resource recovery.
240;The diagram shows the different stages in the production of woolen goods.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram below depicts several steps in producing the woolen goods.Overall, we can divide the steps into two stages where the first one is you have to produce the wool and the second one is to make the string.In order to get the wool pr the string, we have to do the shearing process and clean them after we take them from the sheep. After that, we let them dry in a sufficient temperature outside so that we can spin them.After we finish the spinning process, we break them into two productions which are wool and string. The string production can be recycled while the wool can be made into tufts of wool and put them in the tuft of storage.The balls of yarn comes from the tuft storage which later are the things that we are knitting. The balls of yarn are also the main source to make woolen goods such carpets and jackets which are usually we use in a daily life.; It starts with sheep farming where sheep are bred and the wool is harvested by shearing. Wool is sorted and classified according to its quality and colour. After washing, it is combed and made into a cord called a sliver. It is then spun into yarn and woven into cloth. The quality of the wool also plays a part in the final product. From the various stages, it can be seen that carding and spinning are important in producing good quality woolen goods. Carding aligns the fibres and spinning determines the thickness and twist of the yarn. To produce good quality woolen goods, therefore, every stage of the production process must be carried out with care. On the other hand, scouring and sorting lay the foundation for the subsequent stages. However, all these stages are interconnected and the quality of the woolen goods depends on the preceding ones. These stages have to be understood so that the manufacturer can optimize his process to produce woolen goods of good quality. From the time of wool harvesting to spinning, all these stages are important in producing the finished woolen goods.
734;The diagram shows the procedure for university entry for high school graduates.Write a report for a university or college lecturer describing the information.;The given diagram illustrates how high school students can get entry in the university.Overall, it is clear that it is a multi-phase procedure and starts from completing high school education and ends in university admission, by submitting complete admission form and all required documents.First of all, the aspirants should have completed high school education. Then, they need to download application from the website to fill it. After completion of the admission form, it has to be sent to the admin. Also, documentation which has already been compiled is sent to them. Furthermore, admin office also recieve complete application forms for alternative courses. It is the admin office, which decides the fate of applications, by taking three decisions. Some of the applications are granted provincial acceptance in two weeks and they are asked to submit additional documents. The other applications face direct rejection, in which the rejected applicants have given the choice to either apply for alternative course or cancel their applications. The remaining applications are granted enrolment in two week time.Those who are enrolled in the University choose their subjects. After that, they register with the Dean and finally ready to start studying at University.; As can be seen from the diagram, the procedure for entry to a university begins with the completion of high school and the granting of a high school diploma. Then the graduate must register for a standardized entrance examination such as the SAT or the ACT. And the result of this exam, along with the student's high school diploma, must be submitted to the university as part of the admission procedure. The university then reviews the application, taking into account the graduate's previous academic performance, the entrance examination, and other important factors. The university offers a place to the successful candidate, but those who do not meet the necessary criteria may be put on a waiting list or may be rejected. For the successful candidate, the final stage of the procedure is to confirm enrollment by paying the tuition deposit and any other administrative matters that are required. This diagram provides a clear and comprehensible overview of the entry procedure to a university, and it will hopefully be a useful guide for prospective students. By following these steps, high school graduates can successfully complete the procedure and enter a university to pursue their higher education goals.
844;The diagram shows the production of circuit boards.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The flow chart sheds light on how circuit boards are produced.Overall, the chart presents a multi-phase process that starts with the delivery of raw materials and ends with final products being delivered to factories.When the raw materials are delivered to circuit-board producers, they will be cut and sprayed with fire retardant, and experience the cleaning process. Subsequently, the product will undergo the automatic IC attachment and soldering. Following the IC attachment and soldering, there will be two stages of quality oversight, including visual inspection and quality control testing and final testing. If each of the inspection stages identifies any substandard products, the chips from such rejected products will be discarded. On the contrary, the products that pass the inspection process will be packaged and then sent to relevant users.To draw a conclusion, the production of circuit boards consists of a few stages, such as cutting and spraying, IC attachment and soldering, quality supervision, etc.;" This diagram shows the process of making circuit boards, which involves a number of complicated steps that convert raw materials into functioning electronic components. First the copper-clad laminate is cut to the required size. This first step is important, as it determines the final dimensions and material. Next it is exposed to chemical etching and then the copper layer is partly removed to make the circuit paths, and the excess is removed to ensure high conductivity and electrical performance. After that the board is drilled to accommodate the components; this requires careful planning and must be accurate to ensure accurate placement of the components. Then it is coated with solder mask, and is printed with identifying marks and soldering pads to facilitate assembly. Finally it is tested and packed for shipment. This process combines mechanical and chemical steps to produce a very specialised and important component of modern electronics. Compared with traditional production methods, it requires a higher level of precision and a cleaner environment, since dust and other particles may be damaging to electronic components. It can be seen from these main features that making circuit boards is a complex process, and it is an important part of modern industry."
794;The diagram shows the production of hydroelectricitySummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram displays the general principles of how electricity is generated in a dam. In general, to produce hydroenergy, there should be a difference in the level of water flowing through the turbine.The water is stored in the reservoir out of which it goes through the intake to the penstrock. The pens should be inclined. This means that its high point is in the intake and then it goes down to the turbine. The pressure, that the flow creates, makes the turbin roll and start the generator. Generator produces power that is supplied to the long distance power lines.Having passed throuth the turbine, water, in its turn, sharply goes down and falls into the river.As it can be seen from the diagram, the generator and long distance power lines are located on the ground while there parts of the dam, such as the intake, the penstock, and the turbine are all under the ground.; Describe the sequence of the diagram: The process begins with the collection of water in a reservoir. A dam is built across a river to create the reservoir. The main feature of the process is the conversion of kinetic energy in flowing water into electrical energy. The flow of water from the reservoir is controlled by the inlet valve, which is then pushed through the penstock, a pipe which carries the water down to the turbine. The water then passes through the moving blades of the blades, which are connected to the generator, producing the electrical energy. The efficiency of this process is very high, and the efficiency of some plants reaches up to 95%. The energy is then transported to the national grid, where it is distributed to homes, businesses and industries. In comparison to other renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power, hydropower has the advantage of being more reliable. The efficiency of hydropower is significantly higher than the efficiency of the average fossil-fuel plant, which ranges from 33% to 50%. In addition, hydropower is a very reliable and environmentally friendly way of generating electricity. The water in the reservoir can be released as needed, ensuring a continuous supply of electricity.
768;The diagram shows the relationship between a numbers of different languages. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;This diagram illustrates the connection between different types of English language.Overall, English has two big branches - American English and British english, that divide further in to subbranches. Furthermore, British english has more subbranches tan American english.In terms of American English, it divides into two main subbranches - USA and Canada. Canada further divides into two types of language - Angelophone and Francophone Canadian. Whereas, USA branch divides in to six types of languages, such as Philipines, American Samoa, West coast, Mid west, North-east coast and Puertorico.British English has three times more subbranches than American english branch. One of the subbraches is West indies, that divides into Jamaican and Barbados. Similarly, Far east and Australian subbranches also divides into two subbranches (Malay and chinese, and Australian and Newzealand respectively). West african, Angelophones and East African are three languages that belong to the African Subbranch. Last two subbranches - Indian pakistan and British Isles each divide into four types of languages, British Isles into Irish, English, Welsh and Scotish, and Indian Pakistan into four different forms of indian english.; The information given above is about the number of languages spoken in different parts of the world. It is obvious from the graph that the number of languages varies widely from one part of the world to another. The most languages are spoken in Papua New Guinea with 832 different languages. The region with the least languages is South America, with 138 languages. In comparison, Asia and Oceania have the highest linguistic diversity. In Europe, there are 296 languages, most of which are spoken in the east of the continent. Another noteworthy feature of the graph is the number of languages spoken in Africa, with 511 languages spoken in Nigeria alone. This confirms the continent’s reputation for linguistic diversity and complexity. The graph also suggests a relationship between geographical isolation and the number of languages spoken. The most isolated regions, such as Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, have the most languages. This may be because the development of distinct languages is linked to geographical barriers. It is interesting to compare and contrast the different linguistic profiles of different regions in order to understand more about the complex relationship between geography, culture and language. In conclusion, the graph above suggests that the number of languages spoken in different regions varies greatly, indicating the complex and varied nature of language distribution.
192;The diagrams below show how houses can be protected in areas which are prone to flooding.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The schemes compare two different methods of defence for homes that can be easily affected by floods. Overall, they show flood protection with and without a stopbank, while the at-risk home is raised higher above ground level in two pictures.The first diagram depicts how a stopbank acts as a natural barrier to prevent river water from flooding. The stopbank is a small mound of land next to the river that is higher than the 100-year-flood level and prevents the drain from overwhelming its banks. Nearby buildings can be built on stilts to prevent flooding from rainwater as well as the water passing through the floodgate beneath the stopbank, resulting in an area of ‘internal ponding.’If it had not been a stopbank, as described in the second diagram, there would have been nothing to stop the river from flooding. In this case, the solution is to put homes on stilts much higher than the one in the first picture. The height of the stilts is measured to ensure that the floor of the house is three hundred meters above the 100-year-flood level regardless of how deep the water area is under the house. This measure is called the ‘freeboard.’; One of the methods is the use of barriers. The aim of the methods is to prevent or reduce the damage caused by flooding. The diagram shows a house with a wall and a waterproof layer which prevent water from getting inside the house. The diagram shows how a barrier can be placed around a house to prevent floodwaters from getting inside the property. The next method shown is the use of raised foundations. The diagram shows a house with raised foundations which are above the anticipated water level. The third method shown is the use of water-repellent materials for walls and floors. The diagram shows a house with walls and floors which are made of water-repellent materials which can resist the water. In summary, the diagrams show the application of different methods for the protection of houses in areas which are prone to flooding. The information given in the diagrams is useful for owners, architects and engineers who are involved in building houses in flooded areas. These methods, i.e. the use of barriers, raised foundations and water-repellent materials for walls and floors can prevent or reduce damage from flooding.
966;The diagrams below show the design for a wave-energy machine and its location.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;first of all, the picture show (A Wave- energy machine) we can see that there is electricity generator its the machine that take the energy from the waves and it contain two turbines so the air could flow throuh it and from what it shown we can notice that there is two of wave energy machin: the large waves and the small waves.Secondly,the small wavs had low output since its for the small waves, in addition it also had low installation costs because its smaller.in the other hand the large waves had high output and high installation costs since its also large.To sum up we can say that the air flow to the turbine so the turbine could move and got the electrisity , there is also air come from the water levels which hepls the machine get the elecricity that it needs so the people could use it like a solar power.; The device consists of a large, cylindrical structure located on the seafloor, near the coast. It is intended to collect and convert the energy from the ocean waves into a useable form. The cylindrical part of the device is partly submerged under the water and the upper part is above the surface. The shape of the device is unique and enables it to collect and concentrate the energy from the waves. The location of the device, on the coast, is also important. In comparison to other renewable energy systems, such as wind-turbines or solar panels, this device is relatively small in scale and not easily visible. The underwater location also makes it less noisy and its low profile makes it more aesthetically pleasing. In addition, the device can exploit the more predictable wave patterns of the coast, enabling it to generate more energy. This coastal location also makes it easier to maintain and more accessible for the transmission of the electricity produced to land. In converting the energy of the waves into electricity, the device has the potential to provide a clean, reliable and sustainable source of energy. Its unique shape, submerged position and coastal location, therefore, make it an innovative and promising solution for generating renewable energy.
916;The diagrams below show the development of the horse over a period of 40 million years.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant;The diagram depicts the different stages of the body habitus and the relative changes in foot structures that under went in the process of evolution of the modern horse, since 40 million years ago.The modern horse had gone through 3 main stages in order to become it's current version, each stage shows distinctive changes in the body as a whole.Having said that, the earliest species that existed is namely Echippus, then it was mesohippus and finally it was Merychippus.The Echippus is the identified first ancestor of the modern horse that existed 40 million years ago. They appeared relatively similar to the size of a sheep and their foot apearently had four toes.However, Mesohippus was the second in line of the modern horses and was relatively bigger and taller, the foot structure got limited to three toes and the middle toe being the widerest.15 million years after the existance of mesohippus, merychippus emerged, they were similar in both the size and shape of our modern horses, but as far as the foot is concerned the middle toe became more prominent and the rest two toes started to shrink. Finally, the modern horses look twice the size of Echippus and their feet looked proper coronet.; On the first forty million years of its life, the ancestor of the modern horse, Eohippus, was a tiny little animal with four toes on its front legs and three toes on its hind legs. The most striking feature of its development is its transition from a little multi-toed forest animal to a large grassland animal with a single hoof. By the time it had reached the end of the Triassic period, thirty million years ago, it had become Miohippus, which had three toes on all four legs, indicating a gradual adaptation to a more specialised foot structure. A major evolutionary leap had taken place when, about ten million years ago, the genus Merychippus had appeared, with a single hoof on each leg, which meant that the horse could run more effectively and at the same time support its own increasing body weight. Compare the early Eohippus and the modern horse: the former, adapted to forest life, with its many toes, could move nimbly in all directions, but the latter, suited to open grassland, with its single hoof, could run swiftly and quickly and move at a steady speed. The modern horse, Equus, which appeared about four million years ago, kept this specialised foot, but it also became larger and its legs more powerfully developed. To sum up, the diagrams show a remarkable development in the horse, from a little multi-toed forest animal to a large, fast-moving grassland animal, indicating the dynamic development of the species in response to the environment over millions of years.
528;The diagrams below show the existing ground floor plan of a house and a proposed plan for some building work.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The information below shows the present floor plan and changes been suggested. Generally spekaing, there is no big difference, kitchen will stay as a kitchen and living room will stay as a living room.At the moment the living room space is smaller than in proposed new plan. The living room space suggested to be increased as internal wall will be demolited. Moreover, in suggested plan there is no place for storage under the stairs as stairs will be changed in their shape and also there will be no more hall place will be integrated into living room.The door intro kitchen will be switched from single one to double and will be located near the entrance door. The kitchen furniture suggested to be located on the opposite side to the wall and doubled indoor door. However, some things stays the same in both plans. For example, the location of both entrance doors - front and backyard and also wall between hall and kitchen.; The existing ground floor of the house comprises a living room, a kitchen and two bedrooms, with a total area of about 120 square metres. The living room is at the front of the house, next to the kitchen, while the bedrooms are at the back. The ground floor as it is now and the ground floor as it will be after the building work are quite different in several respects. The most obvious feature of the proposed plan is the extension at the back, which will double the area of the house and provide space for a new dining room and a study, effectively making the living area much larger. In addition, the new living area will be much more open-plan than the existing one. The other significant change is the en suite bathroom in one of the bedrooms, which makes the whole house much more comfortable and convenient. The kitchen is also relocated to the back of the house, next to the new dining area, and one of the bedrooms is enlarged. The living room, which is to remain at the front of the house, will have its area slightly reduced. While the existing ground floor plan is compact and rather dated, the proposed plan is a more spacious, modern and practical arrangement, and it will certainly appeal to a family looking to renovate and extend their home. In general, the proposed plan will result in a ground floor that is more spacious, modern and practical.
784;The diagrams below show the water supply system in Australia present and in future.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The given diagram illustrates the processes involved in the water supply system in Australia at the present and in the future.To begin, the first kind of water is located in the dam and storage where the waste water is lead to a water treatment plant. Meanwhile, from the storage come out pure water and provide potable water to households, factories, shops, and all the city. At the same time, the wastewater produced in the city is transferred to a water treatment plant as well.The last type of water is the storm water that is sent to the river from the city.Overall, it can be seen that the process has three types of waters in the process of water supply which are pure, storm, and waste water. depending on the type of water, these can be found in the dam and storage, water treatment plant, river and in different places of the city such as households, factories, shops, among others.; Presently, the system largely relies on water from dams and reservoirs which are treated and distributed to households, industries and agriculture. This traditional method is supplemented by small but significant amounts of water from sewage treatment plants and very small amounts from desalination plants. In the future, the system is expected to change considerably. The most obvious change is the much greater reliance on desalination plants. The system is also expected to be more resilient to droughts and unpredictable weather. A major difference between the two systems is the amount of water which is recycled. The amount of water which is recycled in the future suggests that conservation and re-use of water are becoming increasingly important. The future system appears to be more efficient with less water lost during distribution. The future system appears to be using more sophisticated treatment and distribution techniques. These changes show a more forward looking approach to the management of water which acknowledges the problems of climate change and the need to find new ways of conserving this precious resource. The greater reliance on desalination and water treatment reflects a commitment to reducing the problem of water shortages and ensuring a more reliable supply of water for the growing population and economy.
136;The diagrams show the structure of solar panel and its use.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram illustrates how a solar panel is constructed, and the complex process of how the renewable energy source provides heated water and air to households.The first diagram shows us visual information about the basic structure of the solar panel. It´s construction is mainly a large box with two pipes placed on both sides. Then, one equally large top which is transparent is placed on top of the container.According to the second diagram, the solar panel is designed to provide the home with warm air. Firstly, cold air is allowed in through the inlet and let inside the box. Secondly, the transparent top allows sunrays to transform the cool air to warm air by their heating properties. After that, the warm air goes through and out the outlet.In regards to the third diagram, we can clearly see that the construction is similar with the exception that water pipes are added in the main box, in order to supply households with hot water. In comparison with the second diagram, where air was driven through the pipes, water is the main resource here. After the water has entered the inlet, water passes through the pipes and out; As shown in the diagrams, a solar panel consists of several photovoltaic (PV) cells that are responsible for the conversion of sunlight into electricity. Each cell consists of a semiconducting material such as silicon, which is treated to create an electric field. When the light strikes the PV cell, the excited electrons are free to flow in the direction of the electric field and produce a current. This effect is known as the photovoltaic effect. As the diagrams show, a solar panel can be used to generate electricity in a wide range of applications from small scale residential use to large scale commercial and industrial use. The diagrams also show the layers that form the solar panel: the antireflective layer, the photovoltaic cells and the base. The antireflective layer increases the amount of sunlight that enters the panel, while the base provides both support and protection for the cells. The diagrams also show how several solar panels can be used together to produce a significant amount of electricity, which can be used to power houses or to generate electricity for the national grid. In summary, the diagrams provide a clear illustration of the structure and use of solar panels and demonstrate their potential as a source of sustainable energy. The information in the diagrams is valuable as it provides an insight into the technology behind the generation of solar energy and can be used by students and other researches to help them understand how solar panels work. As the world’s energy resources become more depleted, understanding how solar panels work and how they can be used will become more important.
1360;The education system is the only critical factor in the development of a country, agree/disagree (from Target Band ;This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskSome people say that the education system is the only critical factor in the development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Write at least 250 wordsEducation plays an imperative role in the overall progression of a country. Many people may heavily rely on quality education as preparation for real life employment and experiences. However, there are other factors that are needed to propel a country towards success.We must acknowledge the way the education system of a country prepares most individuals by equipping them with various skills. Prior to gaining a qualification to practice certain professions such as teaching, nursing or accounting, it is necessary for the individuals to undergo rigorous training. Certificate and diploma programs as well as university degrees are good examples of that. Some graduates may even choose to pursue further studies to attain certain requirements to be able to practice their chosen profession.The education system is undoubtedly important in preparing individuals to take on roles leading to the development of a country. However, it seems that producing graduates alone isn’t a guarantee of the advancement of a country. There are other factors that should come into play, and motivation of individuals is one. Without motivation, people may lose track of what they intend to do to contribute to the improvement of a country. drives people to achieve and maximize their potentials, because they are determined to get better at many aspects of their life, eventually yielding improvement for their entire country.Furthermore, the availability of natural resources and job opportunities may also affect the growth of a national economy. Innovations of many individuals require raw materials, and should the country be able to mine these, their production and perhaps even export may help in stabilizing the local market. Finally, it is also important that the availability of employment is aligned with the skills of individuals applying for the positions. Giving skilled people the opportunity to apply their knowledge and experience in their profession makes them more productive, which contributes to GDP growth.In conclusion, education continues to play a pivotal role in the development of a country. However, other important factors should play a role in order to achieve steady and continuous progress.This response adequately addresses the task prompt. The writer’s viewpoint is clear throughout the essay. Each paragraph has its role and they are used effectively to organise ideas and information. The coherence and advanced vocabulary help the writer to create an impression of a skilled, fluent English user. Good control of grammar and punctuation is evident. This essay could achieve Band 8 in IELTS.; the same as target) In my opinion, education is the only critical factor in the development of a country. Although education plays an important role in the development of the country, there are also many other factors, such as economic policies, education, and government policy that contribute to the development of the country. A country with a good education system but a poor economic policy cannot provide jobs for its educated people, and this will only lead to the loss of human resources and the loss of knowledge. Without a stable and harmonious economic environment, the benefits of education will not be fully utilized. With a good education system, but a poor education system, the country cannot develop its economy, and a country with a good education system, but a poor education system, will face many difficulties in the future. And development. A comprehensive understanding of all aspects is required for the sustainable development and prosperity of a country. In short, it is important to understand the interdependence of the above factors and to try to create a supportive and harmonious environment for the development of the whole society.
1291;The end of the world’s fossil fuel resources and the subsequent changes will be a positive development in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Today’s society overwhelmingly depends on products made from fossil fuels. Most people would initially think about fuel for transport, but of course, fossil fuels are part of most of the fabric of life around us, from the plastics on our furniture to the pavements that we walk on. Changing our reliance on these resources can have various consequences; however, I believe that overall the society will benefit from finding viable alternatives for them.Depending on whether eco-friendly alternatives are developed, the positive effect on transport and the reduction of the associated pollution will be significant. Exhaust fumes from motor vehicles, planes and ships decrease air quality and contribute to global warming and the greenhouse effect. People’s health and the health of the planet will surely improve without these industries relying on fossil fuels. It could be that a type of transport crisis could develop as a result if society can no longer provide the power to transport so many individuals to where they want to go. This, however, does not have to be a bad thing, as it could force society to use alternative solutions, such as transport sharing and public transport development. The change in mind set has already begun. Some countries have already committed to having fossil fuel free transport and more cities are banning private vehicles from the centre of cities.Another positive development would be that more time and money would have to be put into developing renewable sources of energy, such as wind power, solar power, hydropower and tidal power. Technologies would improve and be more efficient and again, the world would use fewer sources of energy that cause pollution. This development can also be seen today, with many governments committing to proportions of their power needs coming from renewable resources.I, therefore, strongly agree with the statement that the changes from reducing reliance on fossil fuels will be positive. The only caveat is that society will need to have developed alternative sources of power rather soon, in order to avoid an energy crisis."; On the one hand, depletion of fossil fuels will certainly force people to move towards alternative, renewable sources of energy, such as the sun and the wind. Although some people argue that this development will push humanity towards a more sustainable and more environment-friendly future, I disagree with this to some extent. Furthermore, the end of fossil fuels will also stimulate innovation and bring about an increase in jobs and economic growth in the renewable energy sector. For example, countries like Norway and Costa Rica have already made great strides in the conversion to renewable energy and this has brought about cleaner air and water and healthier environments. This would significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and thus help to prevent the disastrous consequences of climate change. On the other hand, a sudden end to fossil fuels would also have severe economic and social consequences. As it is, the industry that supplies fossil fuels employs millions of people around the world and a collapse of this industry would lead to high unemployment and economic instability. Furthermore, many developing countries depend heavily on fossil fuels to provide them with electricity and transport, and a collapse of the industry would have devastating consequences for their economies. This would lead to a sharp increase in the number of people living in poverty. A more nuanced approach is therefore needed, where the transition towards renewable energy is carefully planned and managed in such a way that it causes the least disruption to the world economy and ensures a more sustainable future. In conclusion, while depletion of fossil fuels will certainly lead to some positive changes, such as a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and an increase in the use of renewable energy, it will also bring about severe negative consequences, such as an increase in poverty and the widening gap between the rich and the poor.
1307;The fact that enormous sums are paid for pieces of art is not acceptable at a time when many people around the world live in poverty. Discuss this statement and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is true that pieces of art in today’s world can change hands for enormous sums. Works by artists such as Picasso, da Vinci and Rembrandt have been sold for millions of dollars. Recently, a Modigliani was sold to a billionaire for one hundred and seventy million dollars. It certainly seems obscene that such figures are spent when many people around the world live in poverty.The work of many charities would be transformed by the money generated by just one of these art sales and in turn, the lives of ordinary people in need would be transformed. Medicines, food and shelter amongst other things could easily be provided, saving lots of lives, many of which would be children. When the issue is looked at from this point of view, the art sales world certainly seems obscene.However, in my opinion, things are unlikely to change. Human greed is endemic and people who have the drive to earn that amount of money and who actually have access to these sums in cash are not often people who will part with their wealth. Lots of prosperous people support many charities, but it is unlikely that they would completely relinquish their access to the luxuries that accompany their lives. The works of art are also often seen as investments in themselves, to be held on to for a period of time and then resold at a profit.In conclusion, in an ideal world, the vast sums of money that are spent on fine and rare works of art would be better spent on helping those in need. In reality, however, this is unlikely to take place.; The price of some works of art is undeniably high and paintings can sell for tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars. The sale of the painting Salvator Mundi by Leonardo da Vinci for $450.3 million in November, for example, is a stunning example of this. These kinds of sales bring the disparity between the rich and the poor into stark relief and demonstrate the unfair distribution of wealth around the world. Meanwhile, millions of people live in poverty, struggling to meet their basic needs, and it seems morally wrong that such exorbitant sums are spent on art, when they could be used to eradicate poverty, fund education, or support humanitarian work. However, it is also important to consider the cultural, historical, and aesthetic value that art brings to society. A work of art can act as a window into the past, preserving the memory of history and culture for future generations. Critics of the art market argue that the money spent on art could be better spent on tackling these pressing social issues. In conclusion, it is ethically questionable that vast sums are spent on art at a time when so many people live in poverty, but it is also important to acknowledge the complex role that art plays in society. In addition, the art market provides work for many people, from artists and art dealers to restorers and museum staff, which makes a significant contribution to the economy. All in all, the issue is complex and a more nuanced view of the situation is needed, one that takes into account both the monetary value of art and its less tangible benefits. Perhaps a balance can be struck between respecting the value of art and helping the poor, for example through the philanthropic work of collectors and art institutions or by making art more accessible and more beneficial to a wider audience, including the less well-off.
1042;The first chart below gives information about the money spent by British parents on their children’s sports between 2008 and 2014. The second chart shows the number of children who participated in three sports in Britain over the same time period.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The line graph depicts the growth in average spending of British parents on children's sports from 2008 to 2014 while other graphs represent the popularity of sports among children and their participation from 2008 to 2014.Overall, the first graph was about the average monthly spend on children's sports which was at an exponential rate while in the second graph football was the most popular among children.To begin with the first graph, the average monthly spending of parents on children's sports was increasing at an enormous rate from 20 pounds in 2004 to approximately 33 pounds in 2014.Meanwhile, the second graph was about participation in three different sports where football was the most popular sport among children approximately 7.9 million in 2008 to roughly 8 million. swimming was growing at a certain rate while athletics was not so popular until 2010 after that there was a rush in participation in contrast to swimming but after the peak in 2012, there was a decrease in participation.; According to the first chart, the money spent on sports by British parents steadily rose from 2008 to 2012, with a big jump from £500 million in 2008 to around £700 million in 2012. After that, the amount spent on sports by British parents flattened out from 2012 to 2014, with only a slight decrease from £700 million to £680 million. The second chart shows the number of children participating in three sports over the same period, football, tennis and swimming. As we can see from the chart, the number of children who took part in football was the highest and showed a steady rise from around 1 million in 2008 to 1.3 million in 2014. The rise was steady. Between the two charts, we can see that, despite the increasing amount of money spent on sports, the number of children who participated in tennis and swimming remained fairly constant, or even fell slightly. The number of children who took part in tennis was the lowest of the three sports. These different trends in the two charts show that there is a complex relationship between spending and participation in children’s sports in Britain between 2008 and 2014. However, the participation rate in football kept rising.
52;The first chart below shows the percentages of women and men in a country involved in some kinds of home tasks (cooking, cleaning, pet caring and repairing the house. The second chart shows the amount of time each gender spent on each task per day.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The two given charts illustrates the houshold work done by male and female of a nation. where firstly, the amount of work done by men and women is measured in percentage, and secondly, the average time devoted to do perform those work is calculated in minutes.Overall, it can be clearly seen that women performed more tasks in both the given terms then men, Although, men performed House repairs more than women.Firstly, women performed more household work than men, their main interest was in cooking and cleaning, where 80% of women performed Cooking and 60 percent cleaning, where men were 20% less in both the tasks. However, Tasks like pet care and house repairs male were higher in percentage then female.Secondly, Ladies performed the mentioned tasks more than men in regards of cooking they spent about 1 hour and 20 min and in cleaning approximately 68 minutes. However, they were equal in pet care, Although men spend close to 20 min minutes in house repair on average basis.; According to the first chart, the majority of cooking and cleaning tasks are performed by women, 83% and 86% respectively. But 81% of men take care of repairing the house. On the other hand, women spend, on average, 60 minutes a day on cooking, 45 minutes on cleaning, 20 minutes on pet care, and less than one minute on repairs. Pet care is almost evenly divided between men and women, 58% of women and 46% of men. Women spend, on average, about one and a half times more time on all these activities, about 14 minutes, than men, about 8 minutes, but men spend, on average, 40 minutes on repairs and 25 minutes on pet care. According to the second chart, men and women divide their time differently, and the women's workload is greater than that of the men. In general, women are more involved in cooking and cleaning, and men spend more time on housework, especially the men. These data are consistent with broader societal expectations of the distribution of labor and the responsibilities of men and women. They also show that women have a disproportionate share of tasks associated with the female care and care of the family and men's responsibility for the physical tasks of their family.
1188;The first chart below shows the results of a survey which sampled a cross-section of 100,000 people asking if they traveled abroad and why they traveled for the period 1994-98.The second chart shows their destinations over the same period.;The first chart indicates the results of a survey of people in the UK who traveled abroad and the reasons why they traveled from 1994 and 1998. In addition, there is another chart which areas they visited. Overall, it can be seen the main reason the UK residents visited abroad is for holiday, and the total number of people who traveled steadily increased every year, except for 1995. In addition, they visited Western Europe extraordinarily much higher than north America, and other areas.Initially, the total number of abroad visiter started at 22,072 in 1994. Somehow the total number decreased in 1995. It was specificalltry 21,610, but the number soared to 24,949 and reached a peak of 28,828 in 1996 and 1998 respectively. To break down the detail, the main purpose is for holidays. It is apparently much higher than other reasons and its percentage tend to be almost two-thirds every year. Aside from holidays, two reasons follow the second reason for business, the third reason for visits to friends and relatives. It is not so significant changes in percentage.Interestingly, , they almost visited western Europe from 1994 to 1998. The proportion of visitors is much higher than in north America and other areas.It seems to be around 90 percent of visitors went to western Europe.The proportion of visiter can be seen slightly increased, however, there is no significant change.; As can be seen from the first chart, a significant number of the respondents went abroad. Their reasons for going abroad were primarily business, leisure and visiting friends and relatives. A small percentage, about ten per cent, went abroad to visit friends and relatives, a sign of the importance of keeping up personal relationships across borders. The majority of people, about 60 per cent, went abroad for leisure, indicating a growing desire to visit new places for recreation. Twenty per cent of people went abroad on business, indicating an increasing internationalization of trade and business. On the second chart, the destinations of the travelers can be seen to be varied, with France, Italy and Spain among the most popular. These are tourist areas and many people went there for leisure. The United States and Japan were also among the popular destinations, probably because of their economic importance. The survey shows that international travel is increasing in popularity and is now part of the daily lives of people in many different countries. There was also an increase in the popularity of some Asian countries, probably because of their economic importance and cultural importance. In summary, the survey shows that international travel is becoming increasingly easy and popular, and is stimulated by both personal and business motives.

Be seated if you are ready for the shot. Sit straight and wait for light signal flash after 3 seconds. After the shot, the photo will be delivered and available on the slot near the coin panel within 60 seconds.; The most important feature of this booth is its automatic operation. A series of operations are followed to produce a photo. The process begins by choosing the desired photograph from a series of templates. Then the picture is taken and is displayed on the monitor for the customer to see. If the customer is satisfied with the picture, he can continue the process, otherwise he can take a new one. After the customer has confirmed the photo, he must pay for it by means of a credit card, a debit card or cash. The ability to accept different payment methods makes the booth convenient and easy to use. The automatic process ensures that the photo is printed to the required quality. This automatic booth is more private and faster than the manual booth. Compared to the manual booth, it offers a better service to the customer. The main features of this booth, templates, photo review, automatic payment and printing, make it convenient, efficient and private for customers to take photos and make prints.
714;The flow chart illustrates the consequence of deforestation. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features.You should write at least 150 words.;"The supplied illustration outlines the problems of cutting forests. As we can see, there are 4 main branches and each of them describes a certain issue, caused by deforestation.According to the first branch from the left, forest destruction can lead to the state when soil becomes hard and ""baked"". It occurs due to the fact that heavy logging equipment compresses the soil, as the first block of the chart says. Because soil becomes ""baked"", rain water starts to run off which causes flooding.If we look at the remaining branches, we can see that they all lead to the same conclusion - less biodiversity. But there are three different reasons for it. The first one is soil erosion. When we cut the trees, we have fewer tree roots to support the topsoil that eventually erodes.The second reason - increased risk of burning. It is followed by the destruction of waste wood. Then we have some micro-organisms such as pioneer species that move in and initiate degradation of vegetation. And it's all resulted in less biodiversity.The last branch starts with the fact that after cutting forests we have less plants to give back moisture to air, so less moisture enters the air. This triggers less precipitation, and so, increased droughts. Plants that unable to withstand hot and dry weather die and it ends with less biodiversity.To conclude everything, the main purpose of the presented flow chart was to demonstrate the severe damage that could be caused by deforestation."; The main feature of the chart is the sequence of events resulting from deforestation. The sequence starts with the removal of trees and goes on to the lack of roots to prevent soil from washing away. The next significant consequence of deforestation is the loss of species as a result of habitat destruction, which leads to the displacement and extinction of many species. Lastly, the process of deforestation leads to the encroachment of rubbish on the rivers and streams, which contaminates the water and causes flooding. The chart also reveals the negative socio-economic consequences of deforestation, including the loss of livelihood for the people who depend on the forest for survival. The flowchart also illustrates the contribution of deforestation to the greenhouse effect, as the reduction of tree cover changes the carbon cycle and releases greenhouse gases. These in turn have a disastrous effect on the global warming process, causing more frequent and more severe natural disasters such as floods, droughts and heatwaves. Furthermore, the chart also shows the necessity of sustainable forest management to reduce the harmful impact of deforestation. The loss of medicinal plants and other non-timber forest products are important for the local communities.
78;The graph and chart below give information on the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures in degrees Celsius (°C) and the average number of days with rainfall each month for two Australian cities.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The line graph and chart below show data on the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures in degrees Celsius and the average number of days with rainfall each month, from January to December, for Brisbane and Canberra in Australia.Overall, both cities have similar tendencies throughout the entire period. Likewise, Canberra has lower temperatures than Brisbane during the whole year. In addition, Brisbane has a higher average number of days with rainfall than Canberra during most of the year.To start with, Canberra's maximum average daily temperatures have a significant decrease in tendency, from 27 degrees in January to only 11 degrees in July. In contrast, Brisbane's daily maximum temperatures present lower fluctuations from 28 degrees in January to just 21 degrees in July. Additionally, Brisbane reaches its highest maximum average daily temperature in February at 30 degrees, whilst Canberra reaches its lowest minimum average daily temperature in June and July at 2 degrees. Furthermore, the average number of days with rainfall decreases moderately during the winter season in Brisbane, from 14 days in February to 7 days in June, July and August. However, this is the opposite tendency in the average number of days with rainfall in Canberra which slightly increases from 7 days in February to 10 days in June, July and August.To sum up, Canberra has rainy and cold winters, whilst Brisbane has rainy and warm summers.; Both cities have distinct patterns of temperature and rainfall throughout the year. The graph below gives average daily maximum and minimum temperatures for one city between 20°C and 26°C, and the average daily minimum temperatures between 16°C and 20°C. The table shows the average number of days with rainfall for each city. The table shows that rainfall is fairly consistent throughout the year in the first city, with an average of 10-12 days of rainfall each month. The second city has a more distinct change in temperature, with average daily maximum and minimum temperatures between 18°C and 25°C and 8°C and 18°C. This means that the first city has a subtropical climate, while the second city has a more temperate climate. There are many implications for agriculture, town planning, and tourism that this could have on the country’s development. The data in the graph and table give valuable information on the temperature and rainfall patterns in the two cities, and suggest that it is necessary to manage the two different climatic conditions for each city in order to avoid disasters. This would be especially useful in order to help reduce the effects of climate change and promote sustainable development in these areas.
920;The graph and pie chart below give information on in-house training courses in a large financial company.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The charts illustrated are a representation of some information regarding in-house training courses in a reputable financial company.In the grand scheme of things, more time was spent on technical aspects of the courses than on the other aspects within the year. Quite conversely people spent less time learning about health and safety. Most of the managers and secretaries thought the courses were important for the job but a handful thought it was a waste of valuable time.55 hours in the year were devoted to training courses. Of these, exactly 30 hours were spent on technical skills, 15 on Career Development, 10 on Inter personal skills and 5 hours on Health and safety.The opinion of Managers and Secretaries was also sought as shown in the next chart. Here we see that majority of both managers and secretaries believe the courses are important for the job; about 84% of Secretaries and just around 76% of managers. It makes sense then that only few of these groups of people think the courses are a waste of time (almost 10% for secretaries and just above 10% for managers).Exactly 50% of managers believe the courses are good for net working while a smaller percentage of secretaries, about 43%, are of the same opinion. A good number still believe the courses provide a good excuse for a change - about 66% for Managers and just shy of 65% for Secretaries."; The graph gives information about the number of courses employees have attended over a period of time. The pie chart gives information about the percentage distribution of the courses into different categories. The majority of courses (40%) fall under the category of “financial skills” which suggests the company places a high priority on training its employees in financial skills and knowledge. The second most popular category is “management and leadership” (30%) which suggests that the company also places emphasis on the development of its employees’ leadership and management skills. This suggests that the company is spending more on the training and development of its employees and is probably hoping to enhance productivity and performance. In general, the company appears to be committed to providing its employees with a range of skills and knowledge. In comparison, “communication and teamwork” accounted for only 16% of courses and “technical skills” for the remaining 16%. This suggests that while the company is aware of the importance of soft skills, it puts greater emphasis on the development of technical and financial skills. In so doing, it is likely to be contributing to the development of its employees’ skills and knowledge. This will, in turn, enhance the productivity and performance of the company.
922;The graph below compares figures for the production and consumption of energy in the US from 1950 to 2000. It also predicts figures for 2025.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The line chart gives the comparision figure about how energy produced and consumed by the U.S.A. in a 50 year period starting in 1950 along with a 25 year projection. There is two lines, one representing the American energy's consumption and the other about the energy production in the U.S.A between 1950 and 2000 and the forecast figure from 2001 to 2025. Those were measured by British thermal Units.By and large, the consumption and production of energy in the U.S.A. grew strongly over the period from 35 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to approximately 90 quadrillion Btu in 2000 and from 25 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to 65 quadrillion Btu in 2000 respectively. There are a prediction in energry consumption reaching 135 quadrillion Btu in 2025 and 75 quadrillion Btu in energy production.The first detail to note is that the consumption and production of engery rose steadily over the period. They were significant fluctuation at the start of the period but had risen to around 50 quadrillion Btu in 1975. This was followed by the another fluctuation between 1975 and 2000 and recovered by nearly 90 quadrillion Btu in energy consumption in 2000 and 65 quadrillion Btu in energy production.The amount of energy consumption in the United States is projected to remain much higher and will be increased as much as energy production overall. Amercian willl spend 75 quadrillion Btu in energy consumption more than in energy production in the prediction of 2025.; What is clear from the graph is that production and consumption of energy are steadily increasing over time. The production figures for energy rose from about thirty-five units in 1950 to eighty-five units in 2000. In 1950 the difference between production and consumption was approximately five units, and in 2000 it was approximately four units. The graph suggests that in 2025 consumption of energy will exceed production, which is a change from the pattern seen so far. Another noteworthy feature is that production and consumption both began to increase more rapidly after 1970, while before then growth was steady but limited. This predicted change may be a sign of greater reliance on imported energy sources, or a major change in energy production capacity. In any case, the graph shows a steady increase in energy production and consumption between 1950 and 2000, with further increase predicted by 2025. The rise in consumption after 1970 can be explained by the industrial growth, technological developments and population growth in the country. The predicted increase in 2025 reflects the increasing importance of energy for the country’s economy and society. Generally, the data show a nation growing and developing, and the increasing gap between production and consumption raises interesting questions about future energy policy.
722;The graph below presents the employment patterns in the USA between 1930 and 2010.Summarise the information by selecting and report in the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The line graph below illustrates the labor force patterns in the USA from 1930 to 2010. According to the graph, farming, fishing and foresting had singled out all the other types of labors and appeared to be the major source of employment in from 1930 to 1960, which had an emplyment rate up to almost 80, but as the US society became modernized, the employment rate in the those traditional types of work had dropped dramatically since 1970, and reached almost the lowest point of zero in 2010, whereas the other three types of labor-industrial, Sales and Office and Technical shared an average growth from 1970 to 2010.The modernization of US society and the developments of urban areas had changed the labor market, as labors in the technical, industrial and service fields were in high demands. In 1930, the employment rates of these industries remained under 20, but they started to increase in 1970. Industrial labor had the most rapid growth, which rose to almost 40 in 2010. It was followed by technical work, which also reached an approximate point of 30 in 2010. Salse and Office came into the third place, which slightly increased to 20 in the end of 2000s. Nevertheless, the of ""other services"" was the category in exception, as it remained unchanged since 1970 and maintained the average point of 10."; The graph of employment patterns in the USA between 1930 and 2010 presents a lot of important changes during the eight-decade period. One of the main features is the dramatic decline in the employment rates in the thirties. This decrease was sudden, and unemployment in the United States fell to its lowest level in 1933. However, from 1940 to 1960, the employment rate gradually rose significantly, and in 1950 it reached a new peak, a reflection of the prosperity and growth of the US economy. On the other hand, after the Second World War, employment increased significantly between 1940 and 1960. But the employment rate started to fall again in the late sixties and seventies, partly due to the oil crisis and the subsequent decline in the economy. However, employment began to rise again in the eighties, and in the nineties it reached a new peak at the end of the millennium, mainly due to the IT and dotcom boom. In this way, in the early twentieth century, employment rates were extremely unstable, but from the middle of the twentieth century, the employment rate has become more stable and more sustainable, highlighting the changes in the US economy over the years. From 2000 to 2010, the graph shows a mixed picture, with notable declines in employment in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.
568;The graph below shows changes in global food and oil prices between 2000 and 2011.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The graph indicates food price and oil price both how to change in the worldwide scale during 2000 to 2011. Their fluctuations of price were similar.In 2000, food price was 90 points, and oil price was $30. Then, both prices had slowly increased till 2007. Suddenly, food price and oil price both had a drastic jump in 2008. Separately, food index price reached to 220 points，meanwhile oil price was beyond $220 where was the highest price in the historical record. Strangely, both prices dropped sharply in 2009, food price returned to 140 points same as the previous price in 2007, and oil price returned to less $40 same as the previous price in 2005. However, since 2009, food price and oil price both performed a shaking tendency. Finally, food price reached to the new highest points, 140 in 2011, and oil price was weaker than food price, which was $100 in 2011.Global food price and oil price are the two dominant index to expose the change of the global financial market. They interact with each other.; At first, from 2000 to 2004, both food and oil prices were quite stable, with food prices remaining around one hundred and oil prices varying between two hundred and two hundred. What is particularly noticeable is that both food and oil prices have risen significantly over the period. In fact, the 2008 financial crisis had a noticeable effect on both food and oil prices, and both food and oil prices fell. Then, from 2005, prices started to rise, with oil prices increasing more sharply than food prices. In 2008, oil prices had risen to around five hundred and fifty, while food prices rose to two hundred and fifty. In fact, when comparing the trends in food and oil prices, oil prices showed more volatility, with sharper increases and falls. Oil prices fell to around three hundred and fifty, and food prices fell to around two hundred and fifty. Nevertheless, both prices rose again rapidly, and in 2010 oil prices reached around six hundred and food prices rose to around three hundred and fifty. In conclusion, although both food and oil prices rose significantly between 2000 and 2011, oil prices fluctuated much more than food prices. In fact, a close correlation between food and oil prices shows that fluctuations in oil prices directly affect food prices, probably because of the strong dependence of food production and distribution on oil. This trend in prices must be understood in order to understand how to reduce price volatility and ensure the security of the world's food and energy supply.
898;The graph below shows how money was spent on different forms of entertainment over a five year period.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The provided barr chart depicts the proportion of money spent on several entertainment categories in three different locations from 1995 to 2000.Overall, television in the US was the entertainment sector with the highest income in 2000, whereas, cinema and video received the lowest income over the same 5 years period in the three locations.The barr chart shows that television had the highest amount of money in 2000 reaching 100 out of 257. In contrast, in 1995, the US television had just above 50 out of 184. Similarly, television in Europe had the same income of the latter in 2000.On the other hand, cinema and video categories were the sectors with the lowest income of the three locations. In Asia, for example, cinema and television represent just a small fraction of the income. Similar patterns can be seen in Europe and the US.; Compared to the previous year, the total amount spent on cinema and concert tickets has risen significantly, from $10 million in 2015 to $18 million in 2019. On the other hand, spending on theaters and sporting events has remained almost constant. The biggest fall is in spending on music festivals, which fell from $12 million in 2015 to $6 million in 2019. Another noteworthy feature is the widening gap between cinema and music festivals. Theater spending started at $6 million in 2015 and ended at $7 million in 2019, while spending on sporting events started at $9 million and ended at $8 million. According to the graph, preferences for different types of entertainment have shifted, with cinema and concerts becoming more popular, while spending on music festivals has fallen. In 2015, music festivals were the most popular entertainment, but by 2019 cinema had surpassed music festivals and become the most popular entertainment. It can be seen from the graph that the entertainment industry should focus on developing cinema and concert experiences to meet the growing demand, while reviewing the strategies for music festivals to bring them back to the forefront of public interest. In conclusion, the steady spending on theater and sporting events indicates a consistent level of interest in these forms of entertainment.
852;The graph below shows information on employment rates across 6 countries in 1995 and 2005.Summarise the information by choosing and describe the main idea, and make comparisons where appropriate.;The bar chart sheds light on how employment rates of each gender changed from 1995 to 2005 in six nations: Australia, Switzerland, Iceland, Britain, New Zealand and the United States.Overall, there are mainly two trends suggested by this diagram. First, the employment rates of males were higher than those of females in both 1995 and 2005 across all six countries. Second, this period witnessed an increase in the employment rates of both genders in all countries.As shown in this graph, the large gender gap of employment took place in Iceland, Australia and New Zealand where the difference of employment percentage between males and females reached approximately 30% in both 1995 and 2005. In the other countries, the difference was between 10% and 15%.It is also apparent that an increase of around 10%-15% in employment proportions appeared in each gender across all nations, especially in Australia where the percentage of employed men rose from about 56% to 70% while that of employed women went up from nearly 26% to 38%.; The following graph shows the employment rates of six countries in 1995 and 2005. The main idea of the graph is that employment rates varied between these countries, and some of them had considerable changes, while others showed no change or even decreased. Among these countries, the employment rate of the UK and Canada has increased significantly, and Japan and Germany have declined. In Japan, the employment rate fell from 75% to 70%, and in Germany from 70% to 65%. The employment rate in the US and Australia did not change much. This shows that employment rates were very stable in these two countries, and that these two countries were not affected by the economic situation at that time. In summary, the employment rates of the six countries were very different from each other, and it shows that each country needs a very appropriate economic policy. I think that countries should always keep an eye on their economies and change them according to the changes in the economic situation in order to increase employment.
1018;The graph below shows the amounts of waste produced by three companies over a period of 15 years.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The line graph gives us informations about how much tonnes of waste is created by three companies between the year 2000 and 2015. It can be observed that majority of the companies reduced their waste in this period and become more eco-friendly.Overall, while company A nd B were reducing their waste, company C provided more waste from 2000 to 2015. Also, company B recorded significant drop from 2005 to 2015.Taking a closer look at the graph, it can be seen that company A created the most waste in the beginning. They recorded 12 tonnes of wastes in the year 2000, however, they reduced their waste consistently in the following years and produced less than 9 tonnes in 2015. Unfortunetly, company C increased their waste records in this period. While they produced little over 3 tonnes of waste in 2000, they rose this record regularly to over 9 tonnes in 2015.On the other hand, company B increased their waste from 2000 to 2005 with reaching over 9 tonnes in 2005 from around 8 tonnes in 2000. However, there is a major drop between 2005 and 2015. They decreased their waste from over 9 tonnes in 2005 to 3 tonnes in 2015.; This chart shows the amounts of waste produced by three companies, A, B and C, over a period of 15 years, from 2005 to 2020. The amount of waste produced by Company A is constantly on the rise, especially from 2010 to 2015. The amount of waste is more than doubled. Comparing the three companies, it is obvious that Company A is the largest waste producer, reaching a maximum of approximately 250,000 tons in 2015. In contrast, the amount of waste produced by Company B is quite stable. The amount of waste produced by Company B is slightly decreasing from 2005 to 2010 and gradually increasing after that. The chart also shows the general trend of increasing waste production, except for Company C, whose amount of waste is slightly decreasing in 2020. Compared to Company A, the amount of waste produced by Company B and Company C is relatively small, reaching a maximum of approximately 150,000 tons and 50,000 tons respectively in 2015. Compared to the other two companies, the amount of waste produced by Company C decreases greatly in 2020, which means that the management of waste has made great progress. In summary, this chart reflects the waste production of the three companies, and there are some encouraging features and worrying features. While some companies are trying to reduce waste, some are continuing to produce more waste.
1238;The graph below shows the number of enquiries received by the Tourist Information Office in one city over a six-month period in 2011.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram given illustrates the number of enquiries received by Tourist Information Office from January to June, a period of six months. Overall enquiries received in persons have shown an increasing pattern in all phases, while the data received by letter or email have shown a declining trend and information received by telephone shows a fluctuating trend.In the month of January, the higheset value in which method in which enquiries were received by telephone with a value of nearly 900 and the lowest amount is 450 and that is in person.In sharp contrast to this, information received by in person and by letter shows the values of 1900 and 1600 respectively, while the information received by either letters or emails habe shown a continuous declining trend from January to May from 750 to 350 approximately and it has remained constant from May to June at the amount of 300.; The graph shows the number of enquiries for six months in 2011. There are significant peaks and troughs, with the highest number of enquiries in July, when the office received about 550 enquiries, making it the busiest month of the year. A notable increase in enquiries is noticeable from April, and enquiries rise steadily until the peak in July. In contrast, the lowest number of enquiries was received in January, with approximately 200 enquiries, indicating that it was a relatively slow start to the year. The months of February and March were also relatively slow, with each month having about 250 enquiries. However, enquiries fell to about 350 in August, and continued to decline in the following months. It is noticeable that, compared to the first half of the year, the summer months (April to July) are more busy for the office. This could be because there is a higher interest in tourist activities as the weather gets warmer. This graph illustrates the cyclical nature of tourist enquiries, with peaks in the summer and troughs in the winter. This information could help the office to plan its staffing levels for the year and to prepare for a higher number of enquiries during busy periods.
14;The graph below shows the number of overseas visitors to three different areas in a European country between 1987 and 2007Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The graph below illustrates the amount of overseas visitors to three different places ( the coast, the mountains, the lakes ) in a European country between the period 1987 to 2007. The unit used in the graph is thousandsOverall, the lakes had the lowest amount of visitors in the graph in 1987 by 10 thousand visitors in oppose the coast had the most number of visitors in the graph in 2007 by slightly over 70 thousand visitors. The mountains had the lowest amount of visitors in all the times visitors combined while the coast and the lakes were really close to each other in the overall amount of vistors nearly the same amount of visitors.In the period from 1987 to 1992 The coast had the highest number of visitors by approximately 40 thousand visitors while the lakes had the lowest number of visitors by nearly 10 thousand visitors and the mountains were the middle between them by slightly over 20 thousand visitors.In the period from 1992 to 1997 the coast also was the highest number of visitors by around 40 thousand visitors in meantime the lakes was lower than the mountains it was above 15 by littile and the mountains were above 25 but the lakes suprisingly rocketed and achived the mountains even went more by 30 thousand approximately.; For example: Overseas visitors to area A rose steadily from about 2.55 million in 1987 to about 4.50 million in 2007. The number of visitors increased substantially between 1997 and 2002, a time when the increase was particularly marked. The percentage increase in this area was substantial, at about 80% over the twenty years. Comparing the figures for the three areas, it can be seen that overseas visitors to area B have increased the most while the percentage increase in area C has been the lowest. In area C, the number of overseas visitors fluctuated between 2 and 3 million throughout the period. Although the figures declined slightly between 1992 and 1997, they recovered in 2002 and remained steady. The data indicate that there has been an increase in interest in the European country as a tourist destination, especially in areas A and B. The graph shows that improved transport links, better marketing and an increase in international interest have all influenced the growth in the numbers of overseas visitors to these areas. In contrast, the lack of change in the figures for area C may be explained by the fact that it is a fairly isolated area, with few tourist attractions.
972;The graph below shows the number of university graduates in Canada from 1992 to 2007.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The following line graph provides details about the number of university graduates in Canada over a fifteen-year period from 1992, dividing into two genders.Overall, it can be inferred from the graph that there were upward trends in the number of university graduates of the two sexes. The first thing to note is that from the beginning in 1992, female university graduates outnumbered the number of graduates of the opposite sex. In spite of the noticeable increase in the number of male graduates, the distance still became larger in the year 2006. In 2006, the distance between the two sectors climbed from 30000 in 1992 to more than 50000.Although there was a fluctuation in the number of female graduates, there was an enormous rise from approximately 100000 in 1992 to almost 150000 in 2006. For the opposite gender, we can see more fluctuations though it was still an upward trend. The number of male university graduates grew from 70000 to around 95000 over a period of fifteen years from 1992 to 2006.; In 1992, the number of university graduates was about 120,000. Generally, the trend shows a significant increase in the number of university graduates. In 1997, the number of university graduates reached 170,000. This growth can be attributed to the increasing number of university opportunities and the increased number of students pursuing higher education. The most significant increase was between 2002 and 2007. The growth between 1997 and 2002 was more noticeable. In 2002, the number of university graduates exceeded 200,000. This showed that the university system in Canada had been experiencing substantial growth. The growth between 1992 and 1997 was more moderate compared with the growth between 1997 and 2007. The number of university graduates rose from 200,000 to 250,000 in five years, a substantial increase. This increase is probably due to a number of factors, such as improvements in the educational system, an increase in population, and the growing value of a university degree.
1258;The graph below shows the percentage of people going to cinemas in one European country on different days.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of people going to cinemas in one European country on different days of the week over a three-year period from 2003 to 2007.Overall, the amount of people deciding to spend time at the movie theatre from 2003 to 2007 fluctuated considerably during weekdays, with the vast majority of people opting to go to the cinemas on Saturdays. Interestingly, the percentage of people choosing to go to the cinemas on Fridays remained stable at 30% through the whole three years.In 2003, only one in ten people decided to go to the cinemas on Mondays, as opposed to the two fifths of people choosing to go on Saturdays and the just under a third of people opting for Sundays. In 2005, the trend experienced a downward trend during weekdays but eventually rose significantly to just under a half and just over a third during weekends, outracing the rate of 2003 and 2007. Lastly, in 2007 the rate continued to present considerable fluctuations, hitting a high point of approximately two fifths on Saturdays.; The most notable feature of the graph is a clear peak of cinema attendance on Sundays, when approximately 25 per cent of the population attends the cinema. At first glance, it can be seen that the numbers of people attending the cinema are significantly different from one day to another. Another significant feature of the graph is the increasing trend of cinema attendance during the week. This is shown by the fact that only 5 per cent of the population attend the cinema on Mondays and Tuesdays. Comparing the numbers of people going to the cinema on different days of the week, it can be seen that Thursdays and Fridays are attended by more people than the earlier weekdays, but still have lower attendance figures than the weekend days. Continuing with this trend, it can be seen that from Wednesday to Saturday there is a steady rise in the percentage of people attending the cinema, while attendance on Saturdays is still fairly high, at approximately 20 per cent. This is significant because it shows that the majority of people attending the cinema tend to go towards the end of the week. The data presented in the graph suggest that in this European country people are more likely to attend the cinema on the weekend than on other days of the week. The difference between attendance figures on the weekend and weekdays is significant, which shows that people are most likely to want to enjoy their leisure time and indulge in entertainment on their days off. This information would be useful to cinema owners and programmers who want to improve their business and improve attendance figures.
1280;The graph below shows the proportion of the population aged 65 and over between 1940 and 2040 in three different countries.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The line chart depicts by percentage the population aged 65 and over in three countries Japan , USA and Sweden , between 1940 and 2040.Overall , the figure shows that population in Japan would be expected to have highest percentage in alderly by 2040 . Meanwhile USA expected to have the lowest rate .A closer examination of the graph , it's seem that population in Japan was at low point in 1940 with 5% and remain relatively stable till 2020 .Afterwards the trend shows increase slightly to 10% in 2025However, speculation of dramatic growth in trend after 2025 to reach 27% by 2040. Meanwhile in Sweden the data started 7% in 1940 .Athough the trend went up and down till 2020 with 15%.Nevertheless, expected to raise considerably to 25% in 2040.Likewise, in USA the data shows fluctuations starting with 10% in 1940 and expected to end by 23 % in 2040 .; In 1940 the proportion of the population aged 65 and over was low and varied from just over 5% in Japan to just under 9% in Sweden. It is remarkable that the proportion of the elderly in all three countries has risen over the past century. Compared with the other countries, Japan has the greatest change in population structure, and it is clear that this is the result of the significant demography. In 2020 these proportions had increased and Japan had a proportion of about 27% which exceeded that of the United States and Sweden, which were about 22% and 20% respectively. The trend of the increasing elderly population will continue to 2040 in all three countries. Although the United States in 1940 had a higher proportion of the elderly than Japan, in 2040 Japan will have the highest proportion of the elderly of the three countries, reaching about 35%, which reflects a steady rise in the population structure. The population is getting older and this has important consequences for the future. The health and pension systems in the three countries will have to make major changes in the future to support an increase in the elderly population.
1182;The graph shows Underground Station passenger numbers in London.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The line graph illustrates the Underground Station passenger numbers in London which were recorded between the time of 6.00 am to 22.00 pm.Overall, at 8.00 am the number of passengers recorded the highest value which was 400, also the number of passengers at 18.00 pm was about 380. That said it's clear those times had the highest value due to the people going to their work and people leaving.On the other hand, at 10.00 am the number of passengers decreased dramatically to 180. In addition from 12.00 pm to 14.00 pm, the number of passengers slightly increased from 280 to 310. There was a sharp decrease from 14.00 pm to 16.00 pm in the number of passengers where it reached 100. Also, another sudden drop from 18.00 pm to 20.00 pm in the number of passengers occurred where was recorded 120.Furthermore, at 6.00 am and 16.00 pm the number of passengers recorded almost the same value of 100. It can be concluded people's busy time during the day can affect the number of passengers that take the underground station.; The main feature of the graph is the variation in the number of passengers using the Underground Stations, with the numbers at some stations being significantly higher than at others. The busiest station is King’s Cross-St Pancras, with over 97 million passengers a year, making it the busiest station on the network. This highlights the uneven distribution of the Underground’s customers. On the other hand, the station with the lowest number of passengers is Roding Valley with less than 1 million passengers a year. In comparison, the numbers of passengers using the outer stations, such as Chesham and Epping, are significantly lower, with between 1 and 5 million a year. Victoria and Waterloo have a much higher number of passengers than other stations, as they are situated near to major tourist and business areas. The differences in the number of passengers between central and outer stations show the importance of strategic planning and allocation of resources to suit the different needs of each station. These differences can be explained by the lower population density and the lower number of commercial activities in these areas. In conclusion, the graph shows that there is a wide variety of use of Underground Stations in London, indicating the diversity of population and commercial activity across the city. These figures enable the Transport Authority to allocate resources to meet the changing needs of the population.
396;The graphs below show the enrolments of overseas students and local students in Australian universities over a ten year period.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The two graphs compare the development of the students' enrollments for both groups of local and overseas students in Australian universities between the year of 2001 and 2010. Considering the overall trend of both of the groups for the commencing category, the trend seems to be positive with overseas students, while being quite stagnated within the local students.The total number of enrollments associates with a relatively different development compared to the commencing category. For the overseas students, the trend is strongly possively correlated among the whole period, while for the local students, the positive trend has stopped at year 2007 at the rate of 600000 enrolments per year.For the commencing category, the trend has been over the years relatively positive for the overseas students, except between 2009 and 2010. On the other side, the number of enrolments of local students has slightly degraded in the same period.To summarize, the accumulation of the number of enrolments of both local and overseas students is different and utilizes different trends in the same periods. Neverthless, for the total number of students the difference is not enormous, but rather stagnating for the local students starting at 2007.; The enrolments of local students in Australian universities remained fairly constant, with a slight decrease from 2000 to 2005 and then a steady increase until 2010. During this decade, there was a notable difference between the enrolment patterns of the two groups. The number of local students in Australian universities in 2000 was around 250,000, whereas the number of overseas students was around 50,000. The enrolments of overseas students showed a significant increase, with a steady increase from 2000 to 2010. Over the decade, the number of overseas students more than doubled, indicating a significant increase in international student intake. This increase in overseas students can be attributed to several factors, such as the reputation of the universities, the quality of education and the country’s cultural and linguistic appeal. However, by 2010, the gap between the two groups of students had closed, with the number of local students being about 270,000 and the number of overseas students about 120,000. This indicates that Australian universities are increasingly attractive to overseas students and have a more diverse student population. Moreover, the increase in overseas students and the relatively stable number of local students shows the increasing internationalisation of Australian universities. In economic terms, the increase in overseas students is also significant, as they contribute significantly to the country’s economy through their tuition fees and living expenses.
912;The graphs below show the number of men and women in full and part-time employment in Australia between 1973 and 1993.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;"The graphs compare the participation of full-time and part-time workers in Australia as differenciated by gender and age group in the period betweeen 1973 and 1993.Overall, it is clearly seen that the number of full-time workers for both male and female experienced a slight decline as part-time work become more favourable among these employees. Moreover, despite their gender, there are more people in the age group of 15-19 years old employed for part-time jobs.Based on the age group, it is illustrated that the number of full-time and part-time male workers between 25-49 years old has no significant difference. However, the lines indicated that for female employees the number of people working full-time and part-time were more fluctuated, meaning that age group influenced their employment status. For example, the female employees at the age group of 15-19 years old working full-time was accounted for almost reaching to 50 per cent in 1973, but stepping down to 20 per cent in 1993; while part-time workers at the same age group has a higher number 1993 compared to those who worked in 1973 by around 32 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively."; According to the information, there is a notable difference in employment between men and women during this period. The number of men in full-time employment has been relatively constant, showing a slight decline from 1973 to 1993. In contrast, the number of women in full-time employment has increased substantially. The majority of women are employed full-time, with only a small proportion employed part-time. The number of men employed part-time has also increased slightly. The number of women employed part-time has increased considerably, although not as much as the number of women employed full-time. This suggests that more and more women are working part-time because of family or other responsibilities. These changes in employment have some important implications for policy makers. These changes indicate the need for flexibility in work hours, particularly for women. The analysis of the causes of these changes could provide valuable information on the evolution of the Australian workforce.
1056;The graphs below show the numbers of male and female workers in 1975 and 1995 in several employment sectors of the Republic of Freedonia.Write a report for a university teacher describing the information shown.;The chart gives information about the number of female and male employees divided by six different sectors (manufacturing, communications, finance/banking, wholesale & retail trade, non-defence public sector and defence public sector) in the year 1975. Overall, male employees outraced female in manufacturing, finance/banking and defence public sector. While in communications, wholesales & retail trade and non-defence public sector, female workers were higher in the year 1975.In manufacturing, number of male employees was slightly higher than female workers by about 280 thousands. Turning to the finance/banking sector, male employees was three-fold more than female workers. Moreover, men work in defence public sector also made up the biggest part of the total number of employees by approximately 190 thousands.The number of female workers exceeded male employees in three sectors. First, the communications sector, which male workers were less than 50 thousands, while the number of female workers were around 240 thousands. Second, the wholesale & retail trade, the female employees were over 450 thousands but the male workers were lower than 100 thousands. Last sector is the non-defence public sector, the total employees were the highest among others, with about 640 thousands female workers and 200 thousands male workers only.; In 1995 there were more women in the industrial sector than in the other sectors. A comparative study of the two charts shows that the ratio of men to women in the various industrial sectors has changed significantly over the twenty-year period. The trend is the same in the building sector where the number of female workers increased considerably from 1975 to 1995. The figures for the service sector are rather different. The service sector, for instance, shows a considerable increase in the numbers of women employed, whereas in 1975 the figure was still low. However, the figures for 1995 show a distinct improvement. This can be taken as indicating a feminization of the service sector over the twenty-year period. In 1975 there was a considerable number of women working in the service sector, and the number increased considerably by 1995. The figures show a general trend in the figures for all employment sectors from 1975 to 1995, particularly in the industrial and service sectors. The agricultural sector, on the other hand, showed a decrease in the numbers of men and women over the twenty-year period. It seems that the agricultural sector, perhaps because of the current structure of the economy, was less productive and the population had shifted from agriculture to the service and industrial sector. It would need further study to find out the implication of these changes and the causes behind them. Perhaps this change was caused by the changing role of women and the policy of the government.
1216;The graphs below show the types of music albums purchased by people in Britain according to sex and age.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The table charts give information about the type of music album that people of different sex and age have bought in Britain. Rock Music is generally the top sellers. The class of people between 25 and 34 years old buy more albums than the others.Rock music is the the more sold type, whereas classical music is the less purchased. However, there is a divergence concerning the type of listeners of the two types of music. Indeed, Rock Music (the most listened type) is particularly listened by people who are aged between 16-35, they exceed the 30%. Instead, Classical Music is particularly interesting for adults which are aged over 45. Indeed, the more than 20% of people of this age buy classical music. By contrast, the yungers, between 16 and 24 years old, who listened to classical music are almost 0%. Pop music, is the second more purchased type. It is purchased by all the types of people even if no one of the class exceed 30% of buyers.There is a difference that concerns the age of people and their musical interests. Nonetheless, people beteen 25 and 35 year old are those who by the most and different types of music. They purchase around 30% of Rock Music's albums, even if the type they buy the most is Rock Music. They are also interested in buying Classical Music. In the opposite position, there are people aged over 45, who are the less versatile listeners. They used to buy Classical Music album (around the 20%) but less that 10% of them buy Pop or Rock Music.; As shown in the figures, there are differences between the types of music albums purchased by different age groups and sexes. The figures give a useful breakdown of music preferences by sex and age. Age is another important factor in determining the types of albums people buy. Generally, men are more likely to buy rock and pop albums than women, but this trend is consistent across all age groups. In general, the younger people, those in the 15–24 age group, are more likely to buy rock and pop albums, whereas older people, especially those over 50, are more likely to buy classical and jazz albums. This might suggest that people’s musical tastes change over time and, as people get older, they become more conservative in their tastes. The figures also show some interesting trends between the different age groups. For example, the 25–34 age group shows a fairly even distribution of music preferences between men and women, with a tendency towards rock and pop albums. However, the 35–44 age group is notable for the greater preference for pop albums by women in this age group, whereas the men prefer rock. This could have important implications for the music industry, which needs to tailor its releases and marketing strategies to specific age and sex groups. By understanding these preferences, music companies and retailers can help to ensure that they appeal to their target audiences and, in this way, improve the overall music buying experience.
874;The illustrations show two stages in the development of the mobile phone. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The illustration indicate different type of mobile phones from distinct era.On the whole, it is clear that there are different perform functions, sizes and weight between these two type of mobile phone. Actually, the contemporary mobile phone is more advanced than the other.Looking more closely in the illustration, one can see that both of them is designed a ear phone on top of the phone as well as a keyboard which are setted under the screen. However, the screen of the former is displayed with black and white, the latter is displayed with full-colour. Moreover, the contemporary mobile phone is setted within different kind of functions such as camera with video capability, e-mail internet music player, multi-player game facility, while the early one is designed without such a series of functions which only has a function select button on the middle of the phone.Furthermore, it is apparent that the size of these phones are different too. According to the illustration, the early one is bigger than the contemporary one, respresenting the former is 130mm and 50mm, and the latter is 90mm and 40mm which can be folded. In addition, the weight of newer one is much lighter than the other, accounting for 70g and 150g, respectively.; The first stage is the big, old, bulky phone, which has a keypad for number dialling and a small, simple liquid crystal display for information such as the signal strength and basic messages. It lacks the advanced features of the Internet, touch screens, and high-quality cameras. On the other hand, the second stage is a modern smart phone, which is light and compact and has advanced features. It can connect to the Internet, send and receive emails, and access the Internet, as well as capture high-quality photos and videos. In addition, it has a built-in camera, both on the front and on the back, allowing users to take high-definition photos and videos. The evolution of the mobile phone is evident in the differences between the two phones, not only in design and functionality, but also in the experience that the users have. The development of mobile technology has progressed from simple to advanced features.
1104;The line graph below shows the number of annual visits to Australia by overseas residents. The table below gives information on the country of origin where the visitors came from.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information given.;"The table illustrates how many people had visited Australia (in million) in two precise years (1975 and 2005), making a comparison based on from which country these people came from.The line graph below outlines the quantity of overseas residents that had gone to Australia from 1975 to the following 3 decades.------------------------PARAGRAH----------------------------Overall, according to the table, 30 years after 1975 people who were visiting Australia increased from all the countries.Regarding to the line graph, the 4 decades were characterized by a sharp climb.------------------------PARAGRAH----------------------------Furthermore, referring to the table, a considerable growth of the total number of visitors was seen (from 8.8 to 30.4); the most noticeable rise was recorded for Japanese people (from 3.2 to 12), whilst the least one was for the Chinese one (only 0.5 million of difference).------------------------PARAGRAH----------------------------In addition, speaking of the number of overseas residents that had visited Australia, it was around 9 million in 1975; 10 years later it went up to 16 million more or less, reaching 25 million in 1995.Lastly, in the first 5 years of the 21st century, Australia was visited by 32 million of them circa."; The graph shows that the number of visitors has been generally increasing year by year. The graph shows a significant increase in visitor numbers in the early years, with a peak in recent years. The table below shows that the majority of visitors come from the neighboring countries of the Pacific region, such as New Zealand, China and Japan. It is also notable that the number of visitors from these countries has been very high. New Zealand was the most important source of visitors. The information shows that the Australian tourism industry is an important source of foreign exchange for the economy. It also shows the importance of the Pacific region as a source of visitors, and it shows that the Pacific region should be paid attention to the marketing and tourism policies. Other countries, such as the United States and Britain, also provide a large number of visitors. In general, the graph and table provide a comprehensive overview of the number of annual visits to Australia by overseas residents, showing important trends and patterns in the Australian tourism industry. The information is of value to policy makers, tourism operators and other interested parties in understanding and responding to the changing patterns of international tourism to Australia.
638;The line graph below shows the oil production and consumption in China between 1982 and 2006.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;This line graph indicates oil production and consumption per day in China from 1982 to 2006. Clearly, the consumption doubled its production in 2006.To begin with, oil consumption started the millions of oil barrels per day for almost two, and remained the same by 1990. But, its consumption suddenly surged to about 3.7 million in 1994. Then, the number of consumption skyrocketed from 1998 and reached a peak of more than 6 million in 2006. Consequently, the consumption tripled, compared with 1982.Secondly, the production also commenced the millions of oil barrels per day around two, and increased its production to three million in 1986. In contrast, its production leveled off by 1994. Afterward, the production slightly kept going up and resulted in 3.5 million in 2006. As a result, the oil production increased, compared with 1982. But it is clear that the pace of production is quite slower than consumption.; The most prominent feature of the graph is the continuous rise in oil consumption, from about 500,000 barrels per day in 1982 to more than 1.8 million barrels per day in 2006. Oil production, on the other hand, rises at a much slower rate. It starts at about 500,000 barrels per day in 1982, reaching a peak of about 500,000 barrels per day in the late nineties, before leveling off. As a result, the gap between oil production and consumption increases and widens, indicating that China's oil demand cannot be satisfied by domestic production alone. The graph shows that as China's economy develops, oil demand increases, and domestic production increases less. The difference between the two lines starts to widen after the early nineties. In 2006, oil consumption exceeded domestic production by more than 50%, indicating China's increasing dependence on foreign oil for its energy needs. This problem will have a direct impact on China's energy policy, trade balance and environmental policy, and the energy security of China's people and the environment.
120;The map and chart below show the information for the global willingness to eat insect products and the current price for certain food available on the market place.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The map and chart gives information on each country's preference to try insect products and the price for food on the market.On the map, the countries with high willingness to try insect products are marked yellow to green, while low tolerance countries are marked red to orange. Over half of Mexico, Peru, and Thailand's populations are willing to try insect products, making them the top 3 countries. On the contrary, Japan had an extremely low percentage in 21%.It is evident on the chart that glutinous rice is the the cheapest food product with $0.82/kg, followed by rice, chicken, pork, buffalo, beef, in that respective order. The chart indicates that the most expensive food is weaver ant, with $10.65/kg. There is an apparent trend in the price of insects, they are less affordable compared to other sources of protein. However, water bugs and house crickets are exceptions to that particular trend. It is also worth noting that male water bugs are more expensive than the female water bugs.; According to the map, the willingness to eat insect products in different regions of the world is very different. Countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America are more willing to eat insects, while North America and Europe are relatively less willing. According to the chart, the current market price of certain foods, including traditional livestock products and insect-based alternatives, is not much different, and insect-based products, such as cricket flour and mealworms, are cheaper than traditional meat, such as beef and chicken. This shows that insect-based products have the potential to become a cheaper and more feasible source of alternative protein. There is an urgent need to find alternative and sustainable food sources to meet the needs of the growing population. Insect-based products have the potential to be a solution because they use less land, water and feed compared to traditional livestock. The information shown in the map and the chart has significant implications for the food industry and for the sustainable development of food. In conclusion, the map and the chart show the global willingness to eat insect-based products and the current price for certain foods. The willingness of certain regions to accept insect-based products provides opportunities for companies and entrepreneurs to develop and market these products. To fully exploit the potential of insect-based products, and to increase consumers' willingness to accept them, it is necessary to carry out further research and development.
882;The map below shows three possible locations for a leisure centre. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;This map describes the possible areas for a leisure centre. It is clear from the graph that the three selected areas have different characterestics which make each of them as unique place.According to what is shown, place A is very close to some industries and that make it unsuitable to be a leisure center. Moreover, this area is not healthy due to the pollution that comes from the industries' smok.For the second area (B), this location is close to the some buildings where people live and that is good choice. However, the only negative of this place is that it will be noise. However, location C is the beast due to its location. It is located faraway from any kind of pollution. People can breath fresh air and enjoy the grean areas.To summarize, we could say that, location C has several positives that make it the best choice for a leisure centre.; B. The centre of the city. The site is close to the main railway station, so it is easily accessible by public transport. The site is close to the main shopping area, so it could be very attractive to the public. It also has many free car-parking spaces, which is an important advantage for car users. On the other hand, the B site is on the outskirts of the city, close to a residential area and is adjacent to a park. It may be more suitable for families and people who want a quieter, less commercial environment. The site is also close to a school, which may help to create links between the leisure centre and the school. On the other hand, public transport is not as convenient as in the A site. C. The waterfront. The site is a unique location with an excellent view. It is close to a school and has the potential to create links with it. It is clear that all three locations have their advantages. But the most suitable location should be chosen, bearing in mind the needs and priorities of the target group and the overall aims of the project.
938;The maps below show the development of a small fishing village and its surrounding area into a large European tourist resort.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The map illustrates on how a fishing village with a population of 12,000 people in 1974 has been converted to a European tourist resort in 2004 which can accommodate 80,000 residents and 50,000 tourist beds.Except for the fishing village, all other places were modified.It is apparent from the map that there has been a huge loss of flora and fauna on this restructure. Dense woodland was replaced with hotels and golf course. Areas allocated for sheep and goats and olives cultivation were converted into tourist shops and farmland for harvesting fruits and vegetables to serve tourists at hotels.A portion of village, harbour and place were boats were stationed has been relocated to accommodate tourists to have a sea view.A pathway has been created from top of the mountain to the beach to facilitate tourist travel different destinations.Consequently, there has been a huge loss in habitat and probably a shift in fishermen jobs. For survival, fishermen would have taken up jobs like working in tourist shops, serving tourists at restaurant and guiding tourists.; In the original village, the main features were a small harbour, a few houses, and a single road leading to the village. The most notable change is the significant growth of the village, which has turned from a tiny village with a few buildings into a vast tourist resort. The single road has turned into a complex network of streets with a highway and side streets. The other most notable change is the development of tourist facilities such as a golf course, water park, and theme park, which did not exist in the original village. The number of hotels and accommodations has also grown dramatically. If you compare the two maps, you can see that the village has been transformed into a large tourist area. The new attractions were built on the surrounding areas, which were previously unused or were being used for agriculture. Basically, the development of the small fishing village into a large European tourist area has brought about an increased level of comfort, entertainment, and attractions, thereby enhancing the appeal of the area for visitors. The natural scenery and coastal location, which were the only attractions before, are now complemented by a wide range of human-made facilities and amenities.
825;The movement of people from the countryside into the cities is happening in many parts of the world, resulting in the problems, especially in cities.What are the causes of this movement, and how can it be reversedGive reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;People move from the countryside into the cities. It occurs in many parts of the world, causing problems, especially in urban areas. This essay will elaborate on the causes of this movement, and the way it can be reversed from my personal standpoint.Centralization has caused this movement. All the major institutions and facilities are in the cities. Thus, people in rural areas have to sacrifice considerable time and effort to travel to urban centres. As it is also costly, people choose to move into the cities so that traveling does not consume their time. For instance, one-fifth of the total population in Korea currently lives in Seoul, the capital city of Korea. In fact, all the educational, medical, and entertainment facilities are centralized in urban areas. It can be reserved by implementing decentralization. The government has to disperse the location of the major institutions and diverse types of facilities into different districts so that people living in remote areas can also benefit.Furthermore, people in remote areas want to earn opportunities for better employment or education. As a city is a point where technologies, investments ,and professions gather, there is a better opportunity for people to get employed or educated in a improved quality. Therefore, people choose to leave the countryside. Thereby, the government can initiate the policies in which firms earn benefit when they move their head office to districts. If the firms commence moving, it will produce a great amount of employment.Conclusively, not only the government but also the businesses and institutions have to co-operate to combat problems resulting from a surge in the movement of people from the countryside into the cities.; This mass movement, also known as urbanization, is one of the most significant world phenomena of the present time. It is mainly due to the fact that people in the countryside have few jobs, lack of roads, a lack of schools and hospitals, and therefore the people prefer to go to cities for better opportunities. For example, the rapid development of industry and technology in cities in India and China have created a lot of jobs and thus lured millions of people from the countryside to the cities. One of the main causes of this mass movement is the difference in economic opportunities between rural and urban areas. Cities offer better salaries, more varied careers, and better business opportunities than the countryside. In order to reverse this trend, a combination of factors is needed. For example, if the government builds better roads, schools, and hospitals in the countryside, it will make life there more attractive and sustainable. Another reason for people to move to cities is that there are fewer schools and hospitals in rural areas, so people have to move to cities for better education and health care. The government can also encourage more people to stay in rural areas by helping them to make a living in the countryside. For example, in the 1970s, the government of South Korea tried to encourage rural development by providing more education, health care, and other facilities.
1299;The number of advertisements for charities on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. What is causing this? Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It indeed appears true that the frequency with which advertisements for charities appear both on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. There can be various explanations for this and it can be seen in both a positive and negative light.One explanation for the increase in the number of charity advertisements is that the charities themselves are becoming more aggressive in their marketing. This can also be seen in the common strategy nowadays to encourage a monthly donation, rather than a one-off donation. The increased marketing is apparent too in the increased numbers of ‘street salespeople’, who stop passersby and try to get them to commit to this monthly payment.A second reason for the increase could also be that there have been more charities started and the number of advertisements would therefore increase and become more noticeable. If these charities are all legitimate, this would mean that more help will be getting to causes that need it. The increase in charities could also be explained by a possible increase of humanitarian awareness. People might be now adopting different ideologies that take into account people in less advantageous positions.If the number of advertisements for charities has risen due to the fact that there has been a positive shift in people’s compassionate principles, this surely has to be seen as an optimistic development. If it is due to the fact that governments have been cutting back, it could be seen as a pessimistic development. In addition, if there are more charities asking for more money, this will inevitably mean that the amount of money donated will have to be more thinly spread, which would be a negative development.There could be several reasons for why there are more charity advertisements today. Whatever the reasons, as long as any money is helping people in disadvantageous positions, it must be seen as a positive development.; In recent years, it has become more and more common to see charities advertising on the Internet and on television. This increase in advertising is due to a number of reasons. More and more people have become aware of and want to do something about issues such as poverty, inequality and climate change. Many more charities have also emerged to address these issues. The invention of social media, for example, has allowed charities to create and share content with millions of people at very little cost, in comparison to the cost of traditional advertising. This development has not been entirely positive for some, who have expressed concerns about philanthropy fatigue and possible scams. But on the whole, it is a positive one. In my opinion, this is partly because charity advertising can create a sense of community and social responsibility. Charity advertisements raise awareness of important issues, inform the public and encourage people to do something about them. The Ice Bucket Challenge, which went viral on social media in 2014, for example, raised over $100 million for ALS research and increased public awareness of a previously little-known disease. In conclusion, an increase in charity advertising on television and the Internet is a positive development. It could encourage people to act positively and contribute to a more caring society. However, potential donors should always research charities before donating to them. They should support charities that are well known and well run. By doing so, they will help to make the world a better place.
466;The picture below shows how a hot balloon works. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features.You should write at least 150 words.;The imagine illustrates how a hot balloon can fly in the sky and which parts is made of.In brief, a hot ballon is composed by a basket, burner where a flame is produced to heat cool air and an envelope connected to it by a skirt and ropes. Hot air is made in order to allow the hot ballon to work.Firstly, the basket welcomes people aboard. Meanwhile, ropes allow to connect the basket to the skirt and the envelope, which is composed by few panels in a vertical lane, multiple gores and a parachute valve. This one is a self-sealing flap that allows hot air to escape a controlled rate.Secondly, Between the skirt and the basket is located a burner which is crucial for the use of the hot balloon. In fact, it has got a propane cylinder that mix this gas with cool air so that ignites a flame to heat the air inside of the envelope. As a result hot air is made, which is lighter than cool air, and allows the hot ballon to fly in the sky.; The image above shows the working mechanism of a hot air balloon. The heart of the hot air balloon is the burner, which is responsible for heating the air inside the balloon. The main features of the operation of a hot air balloon can be summarized as follows. The balloon is heated by a large flame, which heats the air inside the balloon and rises to the ceiling, and the balloon floats. The burner uses gas as fuel, and the temperature is controlled by the pilot. The balloon is made of a light and strong material that can withstand the heat and pressure of the air that rises. The balloon is suspended under the balloon. The balloon basket carries passengers and the pilot. The balloon works on the principle of buoyancy, and the heated air is less dense than the surrounding air, so the balloon rises. To ascend, the pilot ignites the burner and heats the air, and to descend, the pilot lets the air cool down, so the balloon gradually descends. The picture above clearly shows the main components and working methods of a hot air balloon. In general, the mechanism of a hot air balloon is a simple mechanism, and the hot air balloon is rising in the air, and it is a unique and wonderful experience for passengers.
170;The picture below shows the plan of a museum in 1998 and after some changes were made in it in 2008. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The picture illustrates different areas of a museum in 1998 and alterations made in 2008.The museum consists of a garden located in the heart of the plan, with exhibition rooms, tickets entrance, shop, toilet, cafe, and bags and coats surrounded by.Take a look of the plan, in 1998, most of the areas in museum were permanent exhibition rooms and a garden in the center of it, however in 2008 exhibition rooms originally on the left side had been replaced with restaurant, temporary exhibition room, bags and coats, and finally the shop.Although garden maintains the same but be added with cafe sitting area and 2 fountains and parts of the area of cafe was distributed to WC after alterations in 2008.Currently, all of the permanent exhibition rooms are on the right side of the museum while others are on the left. Bags and coats , temporary exhibition room occupy a larger area than before the renovation of the museum.; I’ll give you an idea of how to write it. Unfortunately, I’m a lexical model, so I can’t see the images, but I can still help you write the essay. Here’s a plan: The plan of the museum has changed greatly between 1998 and 2008. The main difference is that in the original plan there is a large central entrance that leads to a large reception area. However, the plan in 2008 shows that the entrance has been enlarged and the reception has been improved. On the other hand, there are more galleries and more exhibits. The collection of the museum has been enlarged and more objects have been exposed. The café and shop have been relocated and expanded and the service has been improved. Compared to the original plan, the museum in 2008 seems to be more modern and visitor-friendly. It should be noted that the access of the building is improved by a ramp and lift for people with disabilities. In short, the transformation of the museum between 1998 and 2008 has been designed to improve the comfort and experience of visitors. Please replace the following with the actual details from the image you are referring to.
650;The pictures show the changes of a park from 1980 to the present day.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The picture illustrates the differences in a park between 1980 and the present. Information is indicated in year 1980 and present, specific locations inside the park and features such as trees, flowers, grass and entertainment facilities.Overall, there have been significant changes in the park from 1980 up to now especially the roads, the flowers, leisure facilities and the south entrance of the park.To begin with, in 1980 the south-west part of the park had four benches but now only three benches are left as a sitting area. Furthermore, in 1980 the park had only white flowers but now has greens grass and blue flowers. In addition, a football area was added in the south-east part of the park with blue flowers on the bottom. In contrast, the number of trees in the north-east part remained the same but now the three trees have different colour and a socializing was added next to the trees. Last but not least, in 1980 the park had only one main road with a blocked south entrance, whereas now the park consists of four small areas and four roads to separate the green areas.; In 1980 the park was a small and open area with very few amenities: a few trees, a small pond, and a path. The transformation of the park from that time to the present day has been striking, as the pictures indicate. In particular, the area has been enlarged with the addition of a large playground, a skate park, and a community garden. In the past, the park was a dull place with hardly any vegetation and no particular architecture. In contrast, today it is a lively oasis with many improvements. One of the most obvious changes from the past to the present day is the introduction of new amenities. The trees have been greatly increased and the pond has been renovated, with a small fountain added to it. The path has been widened and it now has a special lane for cyclists, which is healthier and more sustainable. There is also a cafe, a public toilet, and a large community hall. The park has been redesigned to be more inviting and more accommodating to a wide range of users and activities. The result has not only been an increase in the beauty of the park but also the provision of more habitats for local animals. In conclusion, the photographs show that there have been many changes to the park over the last few decades. Comparisons between the old and the new park have shown the importance of investment in public areas to encourage social interaction, recreation, and sustainable practices. With the improvements and additions the park has become a lively and sustainable community resource.
654;The pie chart gives information on UAE government spending in 2000. The total budget was AED 315 billion.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The pie chart provides data about UAE regime expenditures in ten different sectors namely:law&order,Education,Industry agriculture &employment,Defence,other expenditure,Debt interest,housing the heritage& environment,Social security,Transport,and health&personal social services.while the total budget was AED315 billion for year 2000.In general, the visual indicates that most money went for social security,in contrast to transport that costs least expense on the UAE government from the total budget.To start with,the UAE government provided AED 315 billion as total budget for year 2000. The lion shear was for social security to record the highest value of expenses at AED 100 billion on the UAE government,followed by health and personal social services that AED 53 billion was spent by UAE authorities.Meanwhile, education costs was AED 38 billion from the total budget of year 2000.Interestingly,UAE government spent on other expenditure and debt interest only AED 23 billion for each from 2000's total budget.Later, defence ,Law and order,and housing the heritage and environment AED22 billion,AED17 billion,and AED 15 billion went for each respectively.Finally, the two least value was AED 13 billion,and AED 9 billion from the total budget to be paid for Industry agriculture &employment ,and transport accordingly.; The main features of the chart are that the biggest share of the budget was spent on ‘Infrastructure’, which accounted for 32% of the total budget, or AED 100.8 billion. This large investment in the area of public works suggests that the government put a high priority on improving roads, transport and public amenities in the year under review. In comparison, the amount spent on ‘Health’ was much lower, at 16% of the total budget, or AED 47.25 billion. The next largest expenditure item was ‘Education’, which accounted for 23% of the total budget, or AED 72.4 billion. This substantial investment in education shows the government’s commitment to improving the standard of living of its citizens. The remaining expenditure on Defence, housing and ‘Other’ made up 30% of the total budget, or AED 94.5 billion. Although this is a substantial amount, the government’s higher spending on education and infrastructural projects indicates its commitment to long-term development. In particular, the high expenditure on education and infrastructural projects shows the government’s determination to lay a strong foundation for future prosperity. In summary, the distribution of expenditure shows that the budget for the year under review was strategically allocated to provide for economic growth, human development and an improved standard of living.
1278;The pie charts below give data on the spending and consumption of resources by countries of the world and how the population is distributed.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;Following three pie chats depict the distribution of population globally compared to spending and consumption of resources by countries .Overall , we can obseve in the first figure that world spends more in food and transport .Whilst in second chart summerize population in the world with Asia has bigger share .However third figure notes that USA and Europe consume main resources of the world .By analysing following data , its evident that food have the bigger share of spending money including 24% of total spending . Whilst transport comes next including 18% , housing and cloths consume 12% and 6% respectively . Nevertheless other aspects of life consume 40% . Meanwhile second pie chart about world population . Although, Asia froms 57% of population , highest percentage , Europe and America form 28% distributed equally and Africa 10 % . Interestingly USA and Europe consume 60% of world resources and rest of the world consumes 40% . Clearly that USA and Europe constitue 28% of world population but they consume the main resources of the world.; In the population pie chart it can be seen that 60% of the world population is distributed in Asia, with the rest distributed between Africa, Europe and the Americas and Oceania. The spending and consumption of resources pie chart shows that by contrast, spending and consumption of resources is largely uneven between Asia, Europe, America and Oceania. Both spending and consumption are unevenly distributed between the countries of the world. In spending the figure shows that North America spends about 40% of the world’s spending, Asia spends about 30%, Europe about 20%. On the other hand, in consumption, the figure shows that Asia consumes about 40% of the world’s resources, North America consumes about 40%, Europe consumes about 20%, and the Americas consume about 10%. The figures for spending and consumption are strikingly different from the population figures. This is a significant inequality in the distribution of spending and consumption. In conclusion, the figures reveal a complex picture of how population, spending and consumption do not map on evenly between regions. In the first place, this information reveals a substantial gap between the size of the population of certain regions like Asia and Africa and their relative influence in spending and consumption. This can be interpreted as an indicator of untapped potential for a region or unmet basic needs. This kind of information is vital to address global issues of resource distribution, economic development and sustainability.
546;The pie charts below show how dangerous waste products are dealt with in three countries.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;"The pie charts illustrate the dealing with dangerous waste products in the Republic of Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. It can be clearly seen that the last country is the only one where people do not use the recycling method; instead, they prefer chemical treatment and dumping at sea.According to the data, the underground method (82%) coloured in red in the United Kingdom pie chart prevails, compared to Sweden (55%) and the Republic of Korea (22%), coloured in green. On the other hand, people in the Republic of Korea prefer to use the recycling method 69%) the most, while those who live in Sweden do not use it so often (25%).The United Kingdom has identical points at 8% for chemical treatment and dumping at sea methods. However, the lowest point (2%) has the incineration method in this country, while people in the Republic of Korea and Sweden destroy waste by fire more often, 9% and 20%, respectively."; At first sight, it is obvious that each country takes a different approach to dangerous waste disposal. Country A relies mainly on the recovery of dangerous waste, with 60% of its dangerous waste going to the recovery. Country B and C rely mainly on land disposal, with 45% and 50% of their dangerous waste going to the land. This is less desirable, as land disposal can lead to contamination and health problems. This is a welcome change, as waste disposal through land is the most beneficial solution for the environment. Incineration is a second method of disposal, with Country B incinerating 30% of its dangerous waste and Country C incinerating 20%. Country A incinerates only 15%. Finally, the three countries have varying ways of dealing with dangerous waste. It is also worth noting that a significant part of Country A's dangerous waste is recovered, while only a small part, of 5% and 10%, is recovered in the other two countries. This may mean that Country A has a more robust recovery system than the other two countries, which will lead to less waste. As the world is grappling with the challenges of preserving the environment, it is important to learn from the experience of these three countries. Although each country has its advantages and disadvantages, Country A's emphasis on the recovery and reuse of dangerous waste is particularly noteworthy.
596;The pie charts below show the average household expenditures in a country in 1950 and 2010.;The provided pie chart illustrates information about the spending rates in homes on different type of serevices in 6 dacades from 1950 to 2010.Overall,as it can be clearly seen that the housing expenditures rates is the highest in 1950 where,the health care rates was the least in that particular year.Where as in the 2010 the most expenditure was on food and the least expenditures was the transportation.As persented in the pie chart,the the majority of the people spend most of their money on housing with aprroximately 72.1percent that number dramaticly decreaced in 2010 to 22.0 percent .In contrast with the food sector where it started with only 11,2 percent in 1950 and rose up by almost 20% reaching to its peak od 34.0% in 2010.In terms, of other sectors including health care and education. the propotion of spending in the health care sector was relaetivly smaller with only 2.4 percent that number was doubled to 4.5.% in 2010.although there was no noticable changes in the education sector.Finally,the most significant change was definitely in transportation since people back in the 1950s where not interested in buying cars the percentage was as little as 3.3 percent that number dramaticky rose up to 14.0% in 2010.while their was obvious changes in other serevices the spending rates grow from 4.4% in 1950 to remarkable jump to 19.2 percent in the year 2010.; In 1950, the food category was the largest, accounting for about 45 per cent of the total expenditure. A comparison of the two pie charts shows that the expenditure pattern has changed significantly over the sixty-year period. This shows the economic situation after the war, when food and shelter were still considered the basic necessities. Secondly, housing was the second largest category, accounting for 25 per cent of the total expenditure. In the rest of the budget, transport and entertainment were allocated a very small amount. The proportion of spending on housing has increased from 25 per cent to 30 per cent. In contrast, the percentage of spending on food has decreased from 45 per cent to 25 per cent, and the amount spent on housing has increased from 30 per cent to 35 per cent. This decrease in the percentage of food expenditure may be due to improvements in food production and distribution, and an increase in the average income of households. The increase in the proportion of housing is due to the rise in housing prices and rents. The increase in the proportion of entertainment and transport is mainly due to changes in people's living habits, economic growth and technological development, making entertainment and travel more available and desirable. These changes reflect the changing priorities and preferences of households. As a whole, a comparison of average household expenditure between 1950 and 2010 shows that there have been significant changes in consumer behavior and economic conditions.
678;The pie charts below show the percentage of housing owned and rented in the UK in 1991 and 2007.Summarize the information by describing the main features of the charts and making comparisons where appropriate.;The diagrams illustrate the proportions of four different kinds of housing in the UK between 1991 and 2007, namely home owner, social renting, private renting as well as social housing.Overall, it is clear that the number of homes in UK recorded a considerable increase from 1991 to 2007, at 22 million homes compared to 27 million homes. Furthermore, more UK residents owened their home while less people chose social renting and social housing during the period from 1991 to 2007.Looking into the details, ,home owner is the top choice for UK residents which comprised 60% in 1991. Then, it considerably rose to 70% after 16 years. Next came to the social renting which recorded an dramatic decrease from 1991 to 2007, at 23% and 17% in turn. The percentage of social housing also significantly plunged from 6% to 2%. The percentage of private renting remain unchanged at 11% over the period.; A clear comparison of the two charts shows that significant changes have taken place in the UK housing market over this 16-year period. In 1991, 67 percent of housing was owned, 31 percent was rented from private landlords, and 2 percent was rented from other sources. It is worth noting that the percentage of housing owned fell significantly from 67 to 59 percent between 1991 and 2007. The percentage of rented housing increased from 31 to 37 percent, and the percentage of rented from private landlords rose to 34 percent. The percentage of rented houses from other sources remained almost unchanged. Comparison of the two periods shows that the UK housing market has experienced a considerable change in the shift from ownership to renting. This 8% decrease in ownership suggests a shift from ownership to rental, which is probably due to some factors such as cost, lifestyle or economy. The increase in private rents also indicates that the private rental market is developing. The increase in the percentage of private rents can be attributed to the growth of the private rental market, which may be due to the rise in the value of houses and the reduction of government rental subsidies. In short, the two pie charts show a transitional trend in the UK housing market, with a significant decrease in ownership and an increase in the percentage of rented housing. I believe that the change is related to the underlying changes in the country's economic, social and policy environment, which in turn affects how individuals and families choose to satisfy their housing needs.
24;The pie charts below show the percentage of time working adults spent on different activities in a particular country in 1958 and 2008. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevantYou should write at least 150 words.;The pie charts indicate how the proportion of time changes in spending on different activities from working adults in a country in the years 1958 and 2008.Overall, while it can be seen that working was the most important event occupied a majority of the percentage of time either 1958 or 2008, the amount of time on sleeping decreased obviously in 2008.First, most of the researched events occupied more time than in the past. Working is one of the events presenting the most serious situation and it took 33% in 1958, increasing to 42% in 2008. Moreover, adult workers in this country were more likely to travel to work, presenting 8% in 2008 from only 2% in 1958. Besides working, citizens tended to relax at home spending 13% of the time on this event, and in which people take 8% of their time in 1958.However, the harder working, the less time was spent in rest. Working adults spent 25% of sleep in 2008, while they spent 32% in 1958. Also, they reduce the time spending in going out with their friends or families, spending only 6% in 1958 from 19% in 1958.; In 1958, the biggest share of the pie chart, about 44%, was devoted to work, 26% to leisure, and 15% to self-care. One of the main features that can be seen from the pie charts is that the distribution of time has changed significantly over the five-decade period. The biggest change is that there is a significant reduction in the amount of time spent working - about 23% - and a considerable increase in the amount of time spent on leisure, about 35%. Self-care also rose to about 20%. This can be interpreted as a more balanced approach to work and private life in 2008. On comparing the two years, it is evident that there is a considerable change in the way working adults spend their time. Another main feature is that the number of hours spent on other activities increased from 0 to 22 in 2008. It is possible that the working adults had more time to spend on other hobbies and responsibilities that competed with their work. In conclusion, the data show the change in time management from 1958 to 2008, indicating the shift from work to private life.
744;The pie graphs show the nutritional consistency of two dinners. Write a report to a university lecturer describing the data.You should write at least 150 words.;The pie charts illustrate the percentage of different types of nutrients (carbohydrates, protein, glucose, saturated fat and others) presented in a medium baked potato and in a macaroni.Overall, it can be observed that carbohydrates have the highest proportion in both types of dinner. In addition, saturated fat has the lowest percentage in medium baked potato, while it is the nutrient with the second higher quantity in macaroni.Looking at the amount of carbohydrates, it is possible to see that medium baked potato has 35%, while in macaroni it can be found at 52%. In a medium baked potato the amount of protein is more than a double than in a macaroni, at 25% and 11% respectively. In addition, glucose has a slight difference, at 15% in the potato and 11% in macaroni.Regarding saturated fat, only one out of ten is presented in the potato, although this number is much high in macaroni, at 21%. Finally, considering other types of nutrients, its varies considerably, at 15% in the potato and only 5% in the macaroni.; You can see that the nutritional composition of the two dinners differs significantly. Dinner A consists mainly of carbohydrate, which accounts for approximately 60% of the meal, with a smaller percentage of fat and a smaller one of protein. On closer examination, it can be seen that Dinner B is more diverse, with a higher content of essential fatty acids and a lower glycemic index than Dinner A. The rest of the meal consists of other nutrients. It should be noted that a diet mainly composed of carbohydrate can result in an imbalance of nutrients if other nutrients are not added. Therefore, Dinner B is a better choice for people who want to eat a balanced diet, or who have special dietary needs or preferences. On the other hand, a high carbohydrate diet is more suitable for athletes and people who work very hard. It is important to note that it is necessary to pay attention to the consistency of meals in order to eat a balanced diet. The conclusions drawn from the pie charts show that there are significant differences in the consistency of the two dinners.
152;The plans below show a student accommodation buildings 2010 and now.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant;The maps illustrate the changes of an architecture which was used for students’ accommodation in the year 2010 and now.In 2010, apparently, there was one main entrance in the southwest corner of the building where students could easily access. The livingroom was situated on the north side of the architecture where students could have a rest. Opposite to the livingroom, there was a bath room on the centre of the floor where students could use to take a shower. A kitchen was established be adjacent to the bathroom in the east side of the plan where children could cook by themselves. It is noticeable that there are three student-bedrooms laying on the southeast, northeast and northwest corners of the building respectively. Besides, the architecture was surrounded by gardens in the north and south sides.Now, after the modifications, an extra en-suits room has been added in the southeast corner be in the adjoining place of one of the student-bedrooms, taking the place of the hallway in 2010. It is worth noticing that the kitchen is also be used as a social area now. More striking is that the livingroom has been reconstructed into a student-bedroom. It must be pointed out that the building has been expanded and a new student-bedroom has been situated on the northwest corner of the architecture. In addition, the garden which was located on the south side of the construction has been modified into a car parking where individuals can park their cars.In conclusion, now the number of student-bedrooms has increased and the function of the student accommodation building has become manifold; : The building in 2010 had 50 rooms, and today it has 75, so there has been a 50% increase in the accommodation. The most important change is the new extension to the east, which has increased the capacity by 50%. The former student union has been converted into a gym with state-of-the-art equipment and machines, while a new student union has been built with a spacious lounge, a kitchen and a games room. The common room has been renovated into a state-of-the-art gym with modern machines and equipment. The old car park has been replaced with a beautiful landscaped garden, with benches, paths and a small pond. This provides students with more amenities and more places to meet and relax. In comparison to the building in 2010, the building today puts more emphasis on the well-being of students and on building a community. There is a peaceful and tranquil atmosphere where students can study and relax. The building's entrance has been refurbished with a new reception and a 24-hour security desk, thereby improving security and safety on the premises. The building today has been transformed into a modern, vibrant and welcoming place, which caters for the diverse needs of its students. The increased accommodation capacity and the improved facilities indicate the university's commitment to providing a comfortable and supportive environment for students to thrive.
998;The plans below show a student room for two people and a student room for one person at an Australian university.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The layout illustrates the structure of student rooms for one and two people respectively in an university in Australia.Overall, It can be obeserved that cost for one person in a double occupancy room is lower than expense in single room. the plan compares the amenities in both the rooms.Firstly the cost of one person is dollar 175/week in double room as compare to dollar 200 in single occupancy. The double occupancy room seems more cost effective and euipped with shared amenities.There is an evident difference in the size and facilities in both the room. The remarkable differences is table and chair.which are missing in the single room. Double occuapncy room comes additional cupboard and bookshelf as well. The width of the room is 4 meters and bigger as compare to single room which is 2.5 meters in dimesnions. Kitchen facilities are mostly similar in both the rooms.; The plans of two student rooms in an Australian university show that the accommodation for two students is different from that for one person. The two rooms have a similar arrangement of furniture, a single bed, a table and a chair, a bookshelf and a wardrobe. The room for one person is about 10 square metres, and the room for two people is about 20 square metres, so that the second occupier has more space than the first. The room for one person has a private bathroom, which is a notable advantage for the occupant. It also has a small refrigerator and a microwave, indicating that the university has aimed to provide self-sufficient living conditions for its individual occupants. The room for two people is provided with two beds, two tables and chairs, two bookshelves and two wardrobes. Like the room for one person, it has a small refrigerator and a microwave, but the bathroom is shared and is outside the room, indicating that for the convenience of shared living, the university has been willing to make some compromises in terms of privacy. The differences between the two rooms are most notable in the size and arrangement of space and the privacy of the bathroom. Ultimately, the choice of room would depend on the preferences of the individual occupants for privacy, space and social life. The room for one person is the most private and self-sufficient, and the room for two people is the most shared and sociable. Both rooms, however, show the university's intention to provide students with the conditions for study, comfort and social life that they need. This would ensure that the university was able to meet a range of student needs and provide a comfortable living environment conducive to study and personal development.
560;The process below shows how to make dough for a pizza.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;In the diagram, the steps needed to obtain a dough for a pizza are shown, figures are given for grams and time required for the process.In the initial stage, the staple ingredients, namely, 4 coup of 00 flour, 325 gr of water ( roughly one and a half cups) and a half teaspoon of dry active yeast respectively, are blended together in a cup.After being placed in a stand mixer, the primordial dough undergo through 3 mixing stages, with the first and the third at slow speed for 2 minutes each, and the second at medium speed for 5 minutes.Subsequently, the dough is going to be left to rest as long as its thickness has increased twofold, which it would takes at least 2 Hours.Having gotten rid of the bubbles by squeezing them manually, the resulting portion of dough is either divided thoroughly into 3 slices equally sized or making each of the three parts weigh 275 grams.; First of all, the ingredients are mixed: flour, salt, yeast and water. The water activates the yeast and the process of fermentation begins. Next, the ingredients are mixed and kneaded, either by hand or with a machine. In this way, gluten is formed in the flour, which gives the dough its consistency and structure. This process is similar to making bread, where yeast is also used to leaven the dough. After kneading, the dough is left to rise and the yeast produces carbon dioxide. This gas makes the dough expand and give it a light, fluffy texture. Kneading the dough is similar to the process of making pasta, where the dough is also kneaded to create a smooth, elastic consistency. Finally, the dough is rolled out and prepared for topping and baking. This stage is crucial in allowing the dough to develop its characteristic chewiness. It is similar to the process of making bread, but with the important differences that give the finished product its unique texture and flavour. Compared to other types of dough, such as that used for flat breads, the consistency of the dough for a pizza is normally thicker and stronger, to allow it to support a wide variety of toppings. The above steps allow a good, authentic and tasty dough to be made, which is ready for baking.
1372;The proportion of older people is increasing, what problems will this cause and what solutions can be suggested?;In many countries the proportion of older people is steadily increasing. What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.It is true that nowadays people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences to this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.As people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. In other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. A second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. Finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent vital healthcare, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of senior citizens.In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.This essay covers the task requirements, however some problems of aging population get only a brief mention. The linking of sentences in the second body paragraph is somewhat ‘mechanical’ and could have been improved. Information sequencing and organisation in paragraphs are done well. The range of vocabulary and the fluency of its use, as well as lack of errors are impressive. Overall, this is a good example of how to get Band 8 without writing a very long essay.; You will find the following comments: We are in the midst of a significant population shift. The proportion of older people in the world's population is growing at an unprecedented rate. And it is expected to continue and increase. Older people will soon make up a larger proportion of the population. In addition, there will be an increase in the strain on health care systems, as older people will require more medical care and support. One of the main problems of an aging population is the strain on pension and social security systems. With a growing proportion of older people, these systems will be increasingly burdened, which can lead to financial instability and reduced benefits for older people. Another problem is the reduction in the labor force, as older people retire and withdraw from the labor market. This can lead to a lack of workers, knowledge and experience. It will also increase health care costs and the number of health care workers. Solution to these problems can be several. Governments and companies can help older people stay in work after retirement, either full-time or part-time, to help maintain their skills and continue to contribute to the labor market. In addition, older people may need more specialized support and assistance, such as assisted living and home care services, which can also be expensive and difficult to organize. These services must be made available, and in addition, they can be used. In addition, a healthy lifestyle and active aging can also help reduce the need for medical care and support in later life. Moreover, by investing in health care and social services, we can help older people to lead healthy, active and full lives.
1242;The table below describes the number of employees and factories in England and Wales from 1851 to 1901.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The table below shows the total number of employees,including male and female employees, and factories in England and Wales throught out the 60 year period from 1851 to 1901.Overall, it can be clearly seen that the total numbers of people employed had decreased over the period, whereas the number of factories had increased and only went down in the last 20 years.The number of male employees had a significant drop in the first decade,losing more than half the number of employees in 1851 and gradually decline overtime.Additionally,Female employees had a major in incline in the second decade which is exactly 100 thousands employees and countinued to decrease like male employees.As a result, the total number of employees declined noticeably in the first 20 years and steadliy went down for the next 40 years.In contrary,the number of factories increased considerably,reaching 721 factories in 1881 then slowly went downward afterwards.; In 1851 there were about 544,000 employees in about 27,000 factories. The most important feature of the table is the steady rise in the number of employees and factories during the fifty-year period. The most rapid increase in the number of employees was between 1871 and 1881, when the numbers of employees rose from 601 to 1,432 thousand and the number of factories rose from 41,093 to 54,444. In 1861 the number of employees rose to about 734,000 and the number of factories rose from 27,000 to 33,503. The increase in employees was slower than in factories, but between 1891 and 1901 there was a 14% rise in the number of employees and a 6% rise in the number of factories. The data also show that the increase in employees outstripped the increase in factories, indicating an increase in productivity and industrial output per factory. The table shows a pattern of growth, although the rate of increase varied between decades. The overall trend from 1851 to 1901 shows an increase in the number of employees and factories that was more than threefold and more than doubled respectively. This increase shows the industrialization and growth of England and Wales in the 19th century.
292;The table below gives information about the population of New Zealand between 2011 and 2012.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and making comparisons where relevant.;The table details the number of people living in New Zealand changed from2011 to 2012 and divided those people into four age groups.Looking from an overall perspective, the number of all ages was increasing. However, the percentage change in those four devided age groups was not as same as the all ages, to the contrary, two of these groups just showed opposite trend.In terms of all ages, the number in 2012 was 4,460,000, compared to the number in 2011, the percentage change increased 0,6 , which was as same as the percentage change of the 40-64 age group. Besides, we can easily see that the change in 65+ group was the most significant one, with the figure in 2011 500,000, increased 400,000, approximately double in the following year.As for the two decending age groups, under 15 and 15-39, the percentage change were both -0,2 , although the specific numbers were different. The age under 15 amounted to 801,750, was merely declined 1,750 in 2012, at the same time, the number of 15-39 group was largely decreased, changed from 1,520,000 to 1.500,000 in 2012.; In the table above, the population of New Zealand increased from approximately 4.3 million people in 2011 to approximately 4.4 million in 2012. There was an increase of approximately a hundred thousand people. The increase in the population was due to a combination of natural increase, the difference between the number of births and deaths, and migration, the difference between the number of newcomers and the number of emigrants. The population of the North Island, which was approximately 3.4 million in 2011, increased to approximately 3.5 million in 2012, representing the majority of the population of New Zealand. On the other hand, the population of the South Island increased from approximately 930,000 in 2011 to approximately 1.1 million in 2012. Natural increase and migration together account for the majority of the increase in the population. The North Island accounted for the majority of the increase in the population, whereas the South Island had a smaller increase. The population of the North Island is increasing faster, which may be due to the greater availability of employment and the presence of larger cities. On the other hand, the population of the South Island is also increasing, but at a slower rate. These trends may be useful in identifying the changing patterns of population growth and urbanization in New Zealand.
1206;The table below gives information about the underground railway systems in six cities.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The given table provides dataset on subway systems in 6 different cities in 3 different cities in 3 distinctive continents. The figures are displayed in terms of inauguration date, the length of route, in kilometers, and number of passengers in millions.Overall, the table outlines that older systems also are longer in extension and have more passengers.London, Paris and Tokyo were opened before the first half of the twentieth century (1863, 1900 and 1927 respectively). The former has the longest route (394 km) and latter the shortest (155 km); on the other hand the Japanese city has almost three times more passengers than the English capital.The cities with younger systems, namely Washington DC, Kyoto and Los Angeles were all opened after 1970. The North American cities have respectively 126 km and 28 km; while the Asian city accounts for 11 km. The capital of the US has the highest number of passengers (144 million) and the Asian city, the shortest, 45 million."; The table gives a comparative overview of the underground railways of six major cities. It is clear from a glance that the number of lines and stations varies considerably between the six cities. London has the largest system, with 11 lines and 275 stations, followed by Paris with nine lines and 254 stations. Tokyo has a large number of lines, nine, but fewer stations, only 160, compared to the 254 of London and Paris, indicating a more logical and organized network. On the other hand, Berlin has the smallest number of lines, five, but still 195 stations, a large number by international standards. Another important feature of these systems is the number of people who use them daily. Comparing the ages of the systems, London is the oldest, opened in 1863, while Tokyo was the youngest, opened in 1927. The most used system is that of Tokyo, which has a daily usage of 4.8 million, which is higher than the 3.5 million of London. This indicates that, although London has the largest number of lines and stations, Tokyo is more crowded and, perhaps, more convenient for the users. In conclusion, the underground railways of these six cities show many differences, from the extensive systems of London and Paris to the very crowded and well organized system of Tokyo. Each city's history, size, and population have influenced the development of these systems, which is very different from one another and interesting for comparison. There are also important differences in the importance of the system, whether the city values the extent of the network, the efficiency, or the historical importance of the system.
380;The table below shows population figures for four countries for 2003 and projected figure for 2025 and 2050.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The table indicates the population of four countries in 2003, as well as the predicted data for the years 2025 and 2050.Overall, Indonesia was the country having the largest population and is projected to increase in future. In contrast, the population in Italy is foreseen to be lower in the future than in the previous data.First, there were 238 million in the population in Indonesia. it is not only that the number of Indonesian was the highest value in 2003, but also is predicted to have an obvious rise to 274 million in 2025 and 312 million in 2050. Regarding Argentina, the number of people in this country was recorded as 34 million in 2003 and has a bulge to be an almost double figure in 2050, presenting 62 million. the population in the Republic of Korea is forecasted to increase to 52 million in 2025 and remain stable until 2050, with 48 million recorded in 2003.However, Italy is the only country predicted to be declining in population in this table. there were 54 million Italian in 2003 and this will be decreasing to 47 million in 2025. The downtrend will be kept there will be 45 million Italian in 2050.; The table shows that China has the largest population, around 1.3 billion, followed by India, around 1.1 billion. These are China, India, Indonesia and Pakistan. Both Indonesia and Pakistan have significantly lower populations. It also shows that by 2025 both countries have substantial increases in population: an increase of 34% for Indonesia and 46% for Pakistan. By 2050, India is expected to overtake China as the most populous country, with a population of 1.4 billion, while China is projected to have 1.3 billion. In conclusion, India's rapid population growth shows that it will be the most populous country by 2025. However, China and India are still far more populous than both of them. These population trends have important implications for resource allocation, urban planning and economic development in the four countries. The substantial increases in the population of both of the smaller countries of Pakistan and Indonesia are also worth noting.
1228;The table below shows social and economic indicators for four countries in 1994, according to United Nations statistics.Describe the information shown below in your own words. What implications do the indicators have for the countries?;The table compares the performance of social and economic aspects for Canada, Japan, Peru and Zaire in 1995. In general, Japan and Canada outperformed in four social and economic indicators their counterparts, Peru and Zaire.To be precise, regarding the economic indicators, people in Japan earned the highest annual income among the four countries, with US$ 15,760, and Canadian people earned the second most annual income with US$11,100. People in Peru and Zaire earned a lower annual income, almost 98 times less than people in Canada and Japan.With regard to the social indicators, people in Canada and Japan showed a longer life expectancy at birth, both of which had a life expectancy of more than 75 years old, whereas the life expectancy in Peru and Zaire was much lower, with only around 50 years old. The adult literacy rate in Canada and Japan saw the same percentage, both at 99%. While 68% of adults in Peru had literacy, the adult literacy rate in Zaire was only 34%, two times less than Peru and almost three times lower than Canada and Japan. With respect to the daily calorie supply, Canada had the highest calorie supply per person, with a number of 3326, while Japan, Peru, and Zaire received a lower calorie supply with aroud 2000 only.; The table shows a few indicators of social and economic life for four countries in 1994. The indicators are life expectancy, infant mortality, adult literacy and per capita income. The differences among the four countries are considerable. These differences have many consequences. It is obvious that the countries with higher per capita income, such as Country A and Country B, have better social indicators, such as life expectancy and infant mortality. On the other hand, the countries with lower per capita income, such as Country C and Country D, have more serious social problems. In addition, the great differences in per capita income between the four countries suggest that the distribution of wealth and resources is unequal. Those countries with low life expectancy and high infant mortality, such as Country C and Country D, have low economic productivity and increased health care costs. On the other hand, countries with high adult literacy, such as Country A and Country B, have a higher economic development potential. Consequently, the indicators show that, while some countries are well-placed for economic growth and development, others have serious social and economic problems which require targeted policies and programs. Finally, the differences in per capita income may lead to greater social and economic inequalities and to reduced mobility and greater poverty for the disaffected groups. Finally, reducing the differences in per capita income and improving the social indicators are important to the promotion of sustainable development and reduction of poverty.
344;The table below shows the consumption of three basic foods (wheat, maize, rice) by people in four different countries.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;THe given chart illustrates the comsuption of three basic foods(wheat, maize, rice) by people in four different countries which are Cambodia, Poland, Egypt and mexico. The measurement used per basic food is calories per person per day.If we analyse rice consumption first, we can observe that Cambodia leads the consumption rate, followed by far by Egypt, Mexico and Poland. However over wheat the country with highest consumption rate is Egypt closely followed by Poland. Regarding maize the country with a higher consumption rate is Mexico, followed by Egypt, nevertheless the maize consumption in Mexico almost doubles Egipt´s consumption.To summarise the consumption of rice in Cambodia is almost 300% over the rice consumption in Egypt, and very far away from the consumption in Mexico and Poland. The wheat consumption in Egypt is high, and is over a 30% beyond Poland´s consumption. To finalize the consumption of maize is high in Mexico being almost 100% over Egypt´s consumption.; This table clearly shows the great differences in food preferences between nations. Rice is the most frequently eaten food in two countries, with the average per person consumption of rice being 120 and 110 kilograms in Country A and Country D respectively. Taking into account the total consumption of the three basic foods, Country A consumes more than the other three, and the average consumption per person is 250 kilograms. In contrast, Country B and Country C prefer wheat, with the average consumption of wheat in these two countries being 100 and 90 kilograms per person. Maize is the least important of the three foods, with the average per person consumption being only 40 kilograms in Country C. Country D is the only country to show a similar high emphasis on rice, and the average consumption per person is 230 kilograms. In contrast, Country B and Country C have relatively low consumption, and the average consumption per person is 210 and 200 kilograms respectively. Taking these figures into account, the consumption of wheat, maize and rice varies considerably between the four countries. While rice is the mainstay of the diet of some countries, wheat is more common in the diet of others. In conclusion, the consumption of wheat, maize and rice is different in the four countries. It is important to understand these differences so that we can ensure the security of food, the nutritional level of the population and public health.
264;The table below shows the percentage of adults in urban and rural areas who took part in four free time activities in 1990 and 2010. Summarize the information and compare where relevant, by selecting and reporting the key features.You should write at least 150 words.;The chart illustrated the rate of adults in urban and rural areas, who participated in four free time activities at two time 1990 and 2010.First of all, we can see that reading and photography activities increased in 2010 in both territory and it was the favorite activity. The last thirds activities are less popular but knowned some small change.On one hand, 61% of people read in urban area in 1990 compare to 71% in rural and these percentages rose up to 78% for both areas in 2010. Photography knowned a similar change from 7% and 14% to reach a peak at 17% and 24%, in urban and rural areas respectively.On the other hand, percentage of animated play dropped out from 18% to 14% in countries and remain the same in urban areas. Conversely, playing went down in urban from 21% to 14% in 2010 and didn't change in rural areas with 26%.To conclude, reading stay away the favorite activity for people in each areas trought the years. People seemed to be more interested in photography. Animated play and playing remain the same with a little decreased in rural for animated and urban for playing.; This table shows the percentage of adults in urban areas who participated in reading, watching TV, playing sports, and attending concerts in 1990 and 2010. A comparison of the figures for different activities and for different areas of the country shows considerable variation in the data between the two years. In the urban areas, the figures for the percentage of adults who participated in reading, watching TV and attending concerts showed a rather significant increase from 18% to 21%. On the contrary, participation in playing sports fell from 26% to 20%. Both in the urban and the rural areas, watching TV was a favourite pastime with over 80% participation in both years. Reading and watching TV also showed a marked increase from 26% to 35% and 80% to 83% respectively. On the other hand, participation in playing sports and attending concerts both fell from 16% to 13% and from 10% to 8% respectively. This shows that during the past twenty years, adults’ leisure time preferences have changed. Differences between urban and rural areas are to be expected, as they have different ways of life and different priorities for leisure activities. Moreover, the increase in reading habits in both areas shows an increased interest in literature.
88;The table below shows the production of milk annually in four countries in 1990. 2000 and 2010. Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The table is presenting that amount in litres of milk production at these four diffrent coutries in specific three each year during 20 years term.Netherlands and Australia are producing significantly big number of litres milk, compare with those other countries. In 1990, Netherland and Australia is almost same amout of milk production was done, then in 2000, Australia is slightly less than Netherland which is 50000 difference. In 2010, those two countries have big differencies of number of litres wich is more than 2 milion litres.Other two countries are much less production than First two countires. Nevertherless, Tanzania is still the one of the big producer of milk which is third place of this table.Guatemala is small producer, but those 20 years, production is much increase which is 60000; In the year t90, the USA had the highest production of milk with 71.4 million tons, followed by Germany with 23.4 million tons. However, the numbers show that the situation changed drastically in the next decade, so a little analysis reveals some significant features. Canada and Australia were significantly lower than the US and German milk production. During the two decades, the US has increased milk production by 25.5 million tons, while Germany has decreased by 4.3 million tons between the same period. In contrast, Australian milk production has remained relatively stable from 5.8 million tons in 1990 to 6.3 million tons in 2010. On the other hand, Canada's milk production has increased steadily from 7.8 million tons in 1990 to 11.2 million tons in 2010. In general, the trend in milk production in these four countries differs greatly from each other during this two-decade period. The increase in milk production in the USA can be explained by improvements in dairy technology and the expansion of dairy farms. On the other hand, the reduction in milk production in Germany can be explained by factors such as EU regulations, fluctuations in market prices and the reduction of dairy farms.
948;The table below shows the results of surveys in 2000, 2005 and 2010 about one university.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The table shows the ratings given to different aspects of a university and how these differ from 2000, 2005 and 2010.In 2000 the teaching quality was considered good by sixty-five percent of the student, while in 2005 sixty-three percent of them rated good this aspect. However, in 2010 the percentage raised to sixty-nine.In 2000 eighty-four percent of the student found the print resources a valid service. The percent increases to eighty-nine in 2005 and decreases to eight-eight in 2010.With regard to electronic resources, a huge difference between years can be spotted: in 2000 the percentage of students with a good rating for this aspect was forty-four, while it was seventy-two in 2005 and eighty-eight in 2010. This change shows a big jump in the percentage of students that rated good this service.Regarding the range of modules offered the percentage remained stable throughout the year. in 2000 thirty-two percent of the students considered good this aspect. In 2005 only thirty percent of the people asked stated that the service was good. The number was twenty-seven in 2010.With regard to the last aspect the number remained the same for all years: seventy-seven percent of the students gave a high score to this aspect.; A main feature of the survey is that student satisfaction with the university's services and facilities increases over time. The table below shows the results of a survey conducted in the years 2000, 2005 and 2010. The second notable feature is the steady rise in student satisfaction. In the year 2000, 6 out of 10 students were satisfied, this figure rose to 7 out of 10 in 2005, and rose to 8 out of 10 in 2010. This steady increase indicates a positive development in the university's facilities and services. Compared with the previous year, the numbers of students are also growing. The number of students rose from 5,000 in 2000 to 7,000 in 2005 and 9000 in 2010. This growth may be attributed to the fact that the university's facilities and services have improved. However, the number of graduate students has been relatively stable, fluctuating between 20 and 25 percent over the years. The number of foreign students rose from 10 to 15 and 20 in the years 2005 and 2010, indicating that the university's influence on the world is growing. These figures show that the university's reputation and growth will be further developed and improved.
892;The table below shows the salaries of secondary/high school teachers in 2009. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparison where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The table gives information about the salaries of secondary school teachers in different countries in 2009. The main differences between the countries are two. First, a discrepancy concerns the starting salary of teachers. Second, there is a gap in the years that teachers need to teach before obtaining the maximum salary.On the one hand, the starting salaries of teachers in the selected countries are slightly different. Luxemburg teachers reach the highest starting salary, equal to 80,000. Instead, in Australia, there are the least paid teachers, they have less than 30,000 per year. There is an enormous discrepancy between Luxemburg, in which the starting salaries are the highest ones, and the other countries. Although Denmark is the second country in giving higher salaries, the money teachers reach the first years of teaching is 45.000.On the other hand, another discrepancy concerns the years that a teacher has to teach before reaching the maximum salary. Indeed, despite being the least-paid teachers, Australians obtain the maximum salary after 9 years of teaching and obtain 48.000 per year. Instead, Luxemburg requires 30 years of work to give teachers the maximum salary, which is also the highest among the countries, and corresponds to 130.000. Denmark is the country in which high-school teachers obtain the maximum salary in just 8 years. On the completely opposite side, Japan teachers have to teach for at least 37 years before obtaining the highest salary.; ... The main feature of the table is the big difference between the salaries of secondary school teachers in different countries. For example, the highest monthly salary of secondary school teachers in Luxembourg was 5821 c.u. and the lowest was 387 c.u. in Slovakia. European countries, such as Germany, France or the Netherlands, are generally in the top five of the list. In comparison, Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea also offer relatively high salaries, which shows a very high priority given to education in these countries. This shows that there are great differences in the priorities of different states and how they support education. Also, the average monthly salary of teachers in the United States was 3,701, but this number can vary greatly depending on the location and experience of the teacher. In Australia, the average salary was 4,038 c.u., but teachers in the city were paid more than those in the countryside. Similarly, the salaries of teachers in the Czech Republic and Slovakia are comparable. Some countries, however, seem to struggle to pay teachers, and this can affect the quality of education and the prestige of the teaching profession. In conclusion, the table shows the significant difference between the salaries of secondary school teachers between countries and even within the countries, which again shows the diversity of priorities, economic conditions and educational systems in the world. In general, this data gives a fascinating insight into the complexity and variability of teachers' salaries around the world.
1212;The table below shows the sales at a small restaurant in a downtown business district.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The chart provides information on purchases at a mini restaurant in the week of october (7th -13th ).Overall, the sales were much more attributed to dinner consumption than lunch across all the days of the week , with a drop in sales by the weekend.There is an observable steady increase in lunch sales as we move across the week. Purchases worth $2400 was made on monday and a slight improvement on sales by $50 on tuesday and a further increase in sales to $2595 on Wednesday.There was however a dip in sales on thursday, with an immediate rebound increment on friday to exactly $2500.However, the sales dopped drastically to $1550 on Sunday.Regarding Dinner sales, we can see that a revenue of $3623 was realised on monday. Afterwards, the purchases became relatively stable at arround $3850 from tuesday to thursday and a further rise to $4350 on Friday. Similarly to lunch sales, there was also a drop by the weekend to about $2450.; The main feature of the table is the significant difference between the sales figures for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The table shows the sales figures for a small restaurant in a downtown business district. At first glance, it can be seen that sales fluctuate throughout the day. Breakfast sales amount to $500, lunch sales to $ 1,500, and dinner sales to $800, indicating that dinner sales are not very popular. It is reasonable to suppose that office workers, on their lunch hour, come to this restaurant in the business district. In contrast, sales in the afternoon, which are usually considered the least busy, amounted to $ 400. For breakfast, however, sales amounted to only $300, which may be due to the fact that office workers, for their morning meal, prefer a coffee shop or a cafe. Sales can be increased by improving the breakfast menu or introducing loyalty cards. It is clear that lunchtime is the mainstay of the restaurant’s business, with sales nearly double those for dinner. This suggests that the restaurant needs to diversify its business strategy in order to make the most of its sales potential throughout the day.
1162;The table below shows the sales made by a coffee shop in an office building on a typical weekday.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The following table illustrate the sales made by a coffee shop in office building on an ideal weekday .Overall , drinks like Tea and Coffee have highest sales in the morning . Likewise , Pastries . However ,more Sandwiches have been sold afternoon .By having a close look at the figure , it is obviously showing that Coffee peaked in the morning with 265 . Whilst reduced slightly between 10:30 - 14:30 to 185 and contiune to fall in the evening . Afterward , sales rise to 200 after dinner meal . Likewise , Tea sales increased in the morning with 110 .While reduced afternoon and in the evening before getting higher at the night with 75 .Meanwhile , Pastries and Sandwiches sales are flucuated . whilst Pastries highset sales number in the morning with 275 , it dropped at night to 80 . Unlike Sandwiches which start at lowest number in the morning with 50 piece only .Nevertheless their sales increased dramatically afternoon to 200 and fall to 110 at the night .; This table shows the coffee shop's sales for one weekday. The data show that there are significant peaks at certain times, and the most important feature of the sales pattern is that the sales are at their highest between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. The main features of the table are that the coffee shop has varying sales all day, with peaks and troughs at different times. The main feature is that there is a very noticeable decrease in sales between noon and four o'clock, and the lowest sales are at two o'clock. This is probably because the workers rush in for coffee in the morning before work. Sales of pastries, in particular, are very high at ten o'clock, which shows that the coffee is often accompanied by pastries. The shop sells coffee, tea and pastries, but the coffee sales are the highest, while tea and pastry are in the lower positions. On the whole, the mornings are the most successful, and more than two-thirds of the day's sales are made before eleven o'clock. This shows that the sales are especially dependent on the morning rush. In the afternoon, however, the sales are very low, so the coffee shop should think about special offers and discounts to increase sales. On the whole, the mornings are very important to the shop's success, and it is recommended that marketing campaigns should be introduced to increase sales in the afternoons.
1168;The table below shows the table made by a coffee shop in an office building on a typical weekday.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The given table presents the detailed amounts of four products that are daily sold in a coffee shop located in an office building. These products include coffee, tea, pastries, and sandwiches. As is shown by the table the data is categorized into four periods on a typical weekday from 7:30 until 20:30.From the first row of the given diagram, it is clear that pastries and coffee are the favorite products during the first three hours of the day, with 275 and 265 units, respectively.The next period has the sandwiches as the most common product between 10:30 and 14:30, while coffee maintain its position at the second place with 185 sales.Turning to the afternoon, during which pastries again retain the dominance with 150 sales in the hours 14:30- 17:30, and coffee occupies again the second place with 145.At the end of the day, this coffee shop sees, for the first time, that coffee is the most bought item at a specific period of the day with 200 cups of coffee served for the clients, while sandwiches this time come second with 110.Turning to tea, which is apparently the least popular product in this place during most of the time apart from the morning hours. The tea sales stand at 110, 50, 35, and 75 in this chronological order.Overall, coffee is the most stable item during the day, as it occupies the first or the second places over the whole period given in this table.; According to the table, the coffee shop was busiest between 10 and 12 noon, and a considerable increase in customer traffic was observed at that time. The coffee was also sold in the highest number at 11 am, with fifty units being sold, making it the most popular item. The table from a coffee shop in an office building on a typical weekday reveals important information about sales and customer preferences. It is possible that coffee is the first choice of the majority of customers, perhaps due to the popularity of coffee as a morning refreshment. Sales of tea and pastry follow a similar trend, but with lower sales than coffee, which was twenty teas and fifteen pastries at peak hour. As a matter of fact, there is a clear decrease in the number of customers and sales after 12 noon. It may be that office workers generally take their lunch break between 12 noon and 1 pm, and thus the traffic in the coffee shop decreases in the afternoon. This decline continues throughout the afternoon and at four o'clock in the afternoon, only five coffees, two teas and one pastry were sold. In view of this trend, the coffee shop can optimize its operation and optimize its sales opportunities. In addition, in order to attract customers during the afternoon decline, the shop may offer promotions and special offers to lure customers and boost sales during the afternoon slump.
48;The table describes the changes of people who went for international travel in 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005. (million).Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The table compares the changes in the number of international travelers in different regions in the years of 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005.It is clear that the total number of international travelers increased in the given 15 year period. However, the increase was the most marked from 1990 to 1995.In the given statistics, Europeans are the ones who like to travel the most and the middle east is the place where least people went for trips internationally. While Africa and Asia and the Pacific experienced a similar increasing trend of travellers from 1995 to 2005.In America, people showed a great willingness to travel abroad between 1990 to 1995. But, then the number stayed more or less at the same level till 2005. Likewise, Europe also experienced a significant increase from 1990 to 2000 in travelling abroad. But, after 1995, there was an increase of around 10 million only.Overall, Europe contributed the most in overseas travel, whereas the Middle East had the least share of overseas travelers.;" In 1990, the number of people who traveled overseas was about 459 million. During this 15-year period, the number of international travelers increased with some fluctuations. In 1995, the number increased by 18%, reaching 543 million; five years later, the number of international travelers increased by 28%, to 698 million. Then, in 2005, the number of international travelers increased by 15%, reaching 806 million. The above data show that between 1990 and 2005, international travel increased significantly every five years, with an increase in the number of international travelers each five years. Among all the regions, the number of international travelers increased the most from 1995 to 2000, rising by 155 million, which was more than twice as much as the increase from 1990 to 1995, which was 84 million, and more than the increase from 2000 to 2005, which was 108 million. The slower growth between the years 2000 and 2005 could be because the market has reached a certain size, or because there are external conditions affecting the growth of the tourism industry. However, it is undeniable that the number of people who traveled abroad increased from the beginning of the century to the end of the century."
836;The table displays the average monthly rainfall for the year in five cities of the world.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The following table gives information on the average monthly rainfall in five cities. In the first row of the table, every month of the year is shown, from January to December. In the first column of the table, five cities are visible; Hongkong,Tokyo,Jakarta,Cairo, and London. The following cities are from very different parts of the world, this why there is great differences between the values. The city with the least rainfall was Cairo, hence there was not any rain from September to December, while Hongkong and Jakarta have had significantly more rain throughout the year. Hongkong peaked at 380mm of rain in August, and experienced the greatest fluctiation in monthly rainfall, with the biggest difference between January and August. In Tokyo, there is a steady increase in monthly rainfall from January to December, with only slight deviations. Jakrata seen the most rain in January, with an outstanding 300mm, which decreases until August, then starts increasing again until December. London is the most consistent out of the 5 cities, with the biggest difference between months being 25mm of rain."; The city with the highest average monthly rainfall is Tokyo with an average of 12.1 cm, followed by New York with an average of 11.9 cm. At first glance, it can be seen that there are significant differences in the average monthly rainfall between these two cities. In general, the average monthly rainfall of the city is also a very consistent feature of these two cities. In contrast, the city with the lowest average monthly rainfall is Dubai with an average of 2.1 cm, which shows that the climate is mainly dry. It can be seen from the table that the average monthly rainfall of various cities in the world is quite different from each other. For example, when comparing the monthly rainfall of New York and Tokyo with the northern hemisphere, it can be seen that the amount of monthly rainfall is usually higher in New York and Tokyo during the summer, while the amount of monthly rainfall in Sydney and the southern hemisphere during the winter is relatively large. It can also be seen from the table that the average monthly rainfall of each city is generally higher in the northern hemisphere, and the monthly rainfall of each city is related to its location, that is, in the northern hemisphere, the monthly rainfall is generally higher in the summer, and that the average monthly rainfall of each city is different in different parts of the world. This shows that it is important to know the local climate and how it varies in different parts of the world.
788;The table displays trends concerning the amounts of fast food consumed in Melbourne. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevantYou should write at least 150 words.;The table outlines the past, present, and future consumption of five types of fast food. Comparing the consumption in 2005 with the present level, it is clear that all consumptios of fast food has increased since 2005 except for the hamburger. While this trend suggests that hamburger consumption is in decline, projected consumption in 2025 shows that burgers would gain renewed interest.Moving the attention away from hamburgers, we can see that the increase in salad consumption is more drastic than that of other fast food categories. Specifically, the predicted increase in fried chicken consumption is 10 units, which is outshadowed by the 36-unit increase for salad. This suggests that, while more fast food will be consumed overall, the general public is shifting towards healthier options.Finally, although the consumption for hamburger, friedn chicken, and salad all increased significantly, figures for fried rice and noodles remained stagnant. This suggests that both fried rice and noodles are less welcomed by the consumers compared to other fast food.;" In the table above, there is an intriguing variation in the consumption of fast food among different age groups. For example, individuals aged 18 to 24 consume fast food the most frequently, with 45 percent of them eating fast food three or more times a week. Another trend that is evident in the table is that there is a variation in the consumption of fast food by income groups. Households with higher incomes (over $100,000) consume fast food less frequently, with only 21 percent of them eating fast food three or more times a week, compared with 35 percent of households with lower incomes (under $50,000). On the other hand, individuals over 65 consume fast food the least frequently, with only 12 percent eating fast food three or more times a week. This reflects the fact that the consumption of fast food varies by income groups. The table also shows that the frequency of fast-food consumption varies geographically. In the inner city suburbs, people consume fast food more frequently, with 30 percent of them eating fast food three or more times a week, whereas the outer suburbs have a lower frequency of consumption, with 18 percent. From these trends, it can be concluded that age and income are significant predictors of the frequency of fast-food consumption in Melbourne; younger people and people with lower incomes are more likely to consume fast food frequently. This could be because of the greater availability and convenience of fast-food outlets in the inner city suburbs. In summary, these trends show that a complex interplay of age, income and geographical factors determines fast-food consumption in Melbourne. Health initiatives and policies based on these trends can help to encourage people to adopt healthier eating habits."
889;The tendency of news reports in the media to focus more on problems and emergencies rather than on positive developments is harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole.To what extent do you agree or disagree?;News reports in the media focus on problems and emergencies more often than on some positive events. Is it really harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole?Let us consider the purpose of the media existence first. I suppose it is to spread important information, so that people may use it in their lives. And problems are usually more important than some positive developments, since, in fact, they are the things which people should be aware of in the first place. For example, due to the COVID, which is an international problem, many people lost their jobs. If they had been notified about the rising of pandemic though, they would have prepared somehow (save more money by cutting unnecessary expenses, learn a new profession and so forth).Moreover, I believe problems shall be solved. And when people are concerned about some problems, they may tend to face them with honor and participate in solving them. For instance, the energy crisis is a huge problem, and it is important to aware society of it, so that individuals could try to be more careful with gas and electricity. In the end, society will benefit from it, so it is not harmful.On the other hand, there is some negative impact of bad news on individuals sometimes. But I am sure it should be considered as psychological issues of particular individuals, rather than a problem of today's media system. People just should not fall in despair because of news reports, but think how they could take an advantage of the provided information to minimize a negative impact and help humanity to solve problems.Finally, in my view, the stated tendency is not really harmful to society, but it may sometimes be harmful to the individuals, and they are responsible for it.; On the one hand, the frequent influx of negative news into the public consciousness can distort the concept of reality and lead to the formation of fear, anxiety and hopelessness. Although some argue that the main purpose of this tendency is to inform the public about serious issues, I strongly believe that this tendency is harmful to both individuals and society. On the other hand, a more balanced approach to news coverage, including more positive developments and success stories, can have a positive and uplifting effect on both individuals and society. On the one hand, an emphasis on problems and emergencies can create a culture of pessimism that makes people disinclined to take part in positive developments and feel powerless, which can have a very damaging psychological effect on vulnerable individuals, such as children and elderly people. On the other hand, reporting on positive developments can inspire individuals and organisations to take action and contribute to the positive development of their own society. Finally, while it is necessary to report on problems and emergencies, the tendency of the media to focus mainly on these issues is harmful to individuals and society as a whole. By adopting a more positive and diversified attitude towards news coverage, the media can play a more active role in shaping public consciousness and helping to create a more optimistic and resistant society.
112;The two tables below show the exchange students from universities in Europe to Australia between 2007 and 2009.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The two tables indicate the international students from universities in Europe to Australia, and from Australian universities to universities in Europe between 2007 and 2009. Overall, An increase in total can be seen from European students to Australia in 2009, while the total number of Australian student remained the same from 2007 to 2009.To go into detail, there are two countries the number of students increased from European international students to Australia. Specifically, It is Sweden, and Germany. It was 34,27 in 2007 in Sweden and Germany, whereas it was 42 and 62 in Sweden and Germany in 2009 respectively. Especially in German students, the number doubled. On the other hand, other countries, such as France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherland can be seen a slight reduction from 2007 to 2009. But the total number increased from 189 to 226, in 2007, and 2009.When it comes to Australian international students who study in Europe, have not changed the total number of students. It is 152, in 2007 and 2009. On the other hand, the number of students soared in two countries, such as France, and Germany.It was 37, 18 in France, and Germany in 2007 respectively. It increased to 58, 26 in France and Germany. In contrast, there are reduction in three countries, in Sweden, The United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Especially in the Netherland, the number of Australian students plummeted from 32 to 18 between 2007 and 2009.France and Germany in 2009.; Firstly, the number of exchange students from Europe to Australia increased steadily over the three-year period. The above tables provide a glimpse into the exchange students from European universities to Australia between 2007 and 2009. In terms of the number of students per country, it is noteworthy that the United Kingdom consistently sends the most students, with over 500 students in 2009, followed by Germany and France. In 2007, there were around 1,200 students, which rose to around 1,500 in 2008 and further rose to around 1,800 in 2009. This indicates a growing interest in pursuing an education in Australia. Looking at the percentage growth, countries such as Italy and Spain have seen the greatest increase in the number of exchange students to Australia, with Italy’s numbers more than doubling between 2007 and 2009. This could be due to a greater awareness of Australian universities or the students’ ability to afford an Australian education. This could also be because of strong ties between the countries and the Australian universities, such as the common language. In general, the data reveals an upward trend in the number of exchange students from European universities to Australia between 2007 and 2009, with some countries showing more significant growth than others. Some countries, such as the Netherlands, maintained a steady number of exchange students while others, such as Ireland, fluctuated. This could be because of economic conditions, changes in government policies or availability of scholarships. The above information suggests that the exchange programs between European universities and Australian universities are expanding, possibly because of the international reputation of Australian universities and the growing attraction of an international education.
661;The typical teaching situation of a teacher and students in the class will not exist by the year 2050. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;For many years, the traditional teaching and learning (T&L) approach, i.e., having a teacher disseminating knowledge to a group of students in a classroom, is dominent over the world.With the advancement of information and communication technology, new learning approaches have been proposed and adopted. For example, students can now use computers to surf the internet to find information or knowledge they would like to study. Moreover, a number of pre-recorded education contents are now available online to provide classes/tutorials to learners. It is expected that this tradition T&L approach will not exist by 2050. Would it be true?There is no doube that there is an increasing number of T&L approaches due to emergence of new technologies. Together with the new approaches, we see there is a shift of the role of teachers these years, not only as one who is responsible to disseminate knowledge, but also a faciliator of learning. Teachers provide proper directions to students during their study, where current technology is not able to offer. Some people say the artificial technology is a threat, but still the accuracy of providing suggestions to students is not very high. Moreover, human teachers are able to provide emotional support to students. Studying is not just a robotic process of human beings. Students may encounter difficulties during the learning process and feel frustrated, which will eventually affect their progression in study. Human teachers could be more aware on this situation, not by the numeric assessment results, but the emotional behaviour of the students in the classroom, and provide prompt and proper counselling support and advice to the students.Also, it is still well-known that computers, even with AI, are weak in creating new knowledge. In the university setting, other than teaching the conventional knowledge, professors would disseminate their new research findings to the students in the class, with discussion among the students, inspiring them to the unexplored areas. This T&L process can only be effective when it happens in a classroom setting.In conclusion, technology may alter the way how we teach and learn. In spite of this, human teachers are also adaptive and certain roles of the teachers cannot be replaced by other tools or machines. Therefore, I believe that the tradition classroom T&L setting cannot be replaced completedly in the future.; In this way, technology will revolutionize the education system and make the classroom unnecessary. However, I only partially agree with this statement. On the one hand, it is true that technology has begun to change the way we learn. Moreover, automation and artificial intelligence can lead to more efficient and effective learning methods, replacing the role of human teachers in some contexts. On the other hand, we have more and more opportunities to learn outside the classroom. But technology cannot fully replace human interaction, such as giving guidance and counseling, and providing emotional support and guidance. The emotional support and guidance provided by teachers are essential for students to develop their social and emotional skills. The way technology has improved the teaching system is more likely to be complementary to traditional teaching methods than to replace them. In addition, many subjects such as music, art and physical education require hands-on learning and interaction, which cannot be replaced by technology. I believe that combining the advantages of technology with the benefits of human interaction is the most effective way to help students learn and develop.
803;The use of corporal punishment (physically hitting students) in schools is in decline, yet it should be used to improve behaviour.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people believe that modifying behaviour among school-going children can be achieved through corporal punishment, and that it being on the decline in schools, is actually a negative development. I strongly disagree with this this view as I am of the opinion that there are better ways of disciplining children to instill positive behaviour, than physically hitting them.Improvement of behaviour among children in schools can be achieved through teaching them good manners rather than using corporal punishment. This means that teachers and school staff should teach children acceptable and unacceptable behaviour as part of their school curriculum from the earleist age they enter school. This way, learners obtain knowledge required for them to practice good behaviour. For example, if a child is taught from primary school-going age that they should clean after their mess, they are likely to practise and carry this behaviour through to secondary school. That way, there would be no need to physically hit children. Although some may firmly believe that corporal punishment is a good form of discipline, it cannot be compared to the actual teaching of good behaviour.Moreover, corporal punishment is likely to produce a fearful and resentful child rather than a well mannered child. It has been found by many researchers that children are unlikely to change their bad behaviour because they are beaten up at school. The behaviour is most likely to get worse, instead, as learners become fearful and resent their learning environment. For instance, in South Africa, some learners were reported to be disrespectful to their teachers because of a bad relationship that existed between them and their teachers as a result of corporal punishment that was inflicted on them. While it may be true that some positive behaviour changes were seen among pupils due to use of corporal punishment, this is at a very small scale.In conclusion, I am of the view that the use of corporal punishment among school-going age children is not a desirable phenomenon, as it is unlikely to produce any required behavioural changes. Instead, instilling good manners in learners through teaching them is more effective, as physically hitting them may even worsen their undesirable behaviour.; The decline in corporal punishment in schools is a positive development because it is widely disapproved of by teachers, psychologists and human rights activists. Research has shown that physical punishment is associated with a range of adverse effects, including increased aggression, anxiety and poorer academic performance. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the statement that corporal punishment should be used to improve behavior in schools? A way of treating children that has long-term consequences for their emotional and psychological well-being, and that goes against the principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. In addition, physical punishment can be considered a violation of the rights of children as outlined in the Convention. Many schools are now replacing the corporal punishment with other methods, such as the “restorative circle”, which is a form of discussion and conflict resolution in a safe and supportive environment. These methods focus on the development of the child’s responsibility, empathy and self-discipline, rather than relying on fear and intimidation. For example, corporal punishment has been banned in Sweden and Norway for many years, and behavior in schools has improved and the well-being of students has improved. This is in line with the principle of providing a positive and supportive learning environment in which the students feel safe, valued and respected. The schools can focus on teaching them to learn, which can be the basis for good academic performance and good social skills. In conclusion, the use of corporal punishment in schools is not an effective or acceptable way to improve behavior.
623;The use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction among many people in society. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;The modern world of social interaction changed completely over the past decades. Now many of us spent much more time interracting through social media, messengers for private or corporate messaging. We also use video conference and sharing our workflow remotely.As for me we have different needs satisfied by communication formed by different systems in our brain. On the one hand we have we communicate with each other aiming to get a useful information. On the other hand communication gives some non-verbal part like a sense of neing involved into one process, belonging to a circle of friends, collegues or family. These two sides of the process of communication are implemented differently that's why each part gets its own advantages and disadvantages thanks to changing integrating new social network technologies.If to talk about an information exchange - as for it became much more efficient with using messages, cloud storages and different coworking tools. But it is true only for those people who use these technology well. As far as I can see many advantages in remote work such as possibility not to waste time for commuting, offices and separate equipment, many people notice that their remote collegues disapperar often and avoid their duties. Some people couldn't concentrate while working at home. As for me people who experince such a problems are just addicted to strong stimules such as face-to face interraction and being managed by their boss. At the same time different internet based tools allow you to share much more information much faster and forever. Now you cannot just forget you task because you can always revise it in your work messenger and cloud folder wherever and whenever you are.One another need - is to have a social interraction. Of course ssocial network give us some advantage even in this area - now we can keep our relationships with more people across longer distances. While moving to another city or country we do not feel isolation so much anymore. It allows us to mentain or ralationships longer and stronger. At the same time such an option give people a possibility to avoid face-to-face communication with people phisically close to them. As for me it gives only one disadvantage - it is getting harder to load some parts of our brain which are evolutionary oriented to face-to-face interraction.I can conclude that social media interraction gave us some new possibilities and cut off some of the old ones. At the same time modern technologies blur boundaries between a real conversation and internet communication. Now we can perfectly see and hear each-other and even support financially. There are also some devises wich allow you to feel even more - like touches or heartrythm of each other. I think that new social media tools and some next directions of these tools will satisfy our face-to-face communication needs more and more over time.; To my mind, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Social media have revolutionized the way people interact with each other. Aside from staying in touch with friends and family living far away, it has opened up a way for people to express themselves and for people with similar views to meet each other. On the other hand, some disadvantages of social media have also emerged. And that is, there are also some misinformation, cyberbullying and social comparison that have an adverse effect on the health of users. People who spend more time with their mobile phone screens than with people are also deprived of this skill. With this in mind, people should try to balance their life between the virtual and the real. It is also necessary for them to maintain their social and emotional well-being. To sum up, I think that social media are good, but that the disadvantages of replacing face-to-face interaction outweigh the advantages.
76;The world health organization recommends that people should eat five or more portion of fruit and vegetables per day. The bar chart shows the percentage of males and females in the UK by age group in 2006.You should write at least 150 words.;This bar chart depicts the percentage between male and female to eat five or above portion of fruit and vegetables per day in the UK. It is clear from the graph that the female is higher than male of percentage.According to what is shown, gradually increased from 19 to 34 ages same that from 35 to 54 ages. Between 55 and 64 ages is siginficant increased about between 19 and 24 ages, After that gradually decreased between 65 and 74. Although, Supposed to 25 and 34 ages, They the more consum but between 55 and 64 ages they is consum the highest. Also, The 75 age is the same percentage, unlike the all under 75 ages.To sum up, we could say that, the all ages is not equal between male and female in same percentage ages, except 75 age, They slight by 25 per cent between unisex. On other hand, Female and male is equal consume in 75 age.; This essay will discuss the implications of the world health organization’s recommendations, in the light of the information given in the bar chart. The world health organization recommends that five or more portions of fruit and vegetables should be consumed by people in order to lead a healthy life. According to the bar chart, there is a notable variation in the percentage of males and females who meet this recommendation in different age groups. For example, the percentages of females between 50 and 64 and 65 and over are higher than those of the younger females and the males of the same age. The information shows that the older people are more likely to follow a healthy diet, which may be due to an increased awareness of health problems or because of health conditions that require them to have a healthy diet. On the other hand, the younger people are less likely to be aware of the health benefits of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and they may also be hindered by the cost, availability and personal preference, to meet the recommended daily intake. In the end, the bar chart reveals that the age and gender differences in the consumption of fruits and vegetables in the UK are important. Consequently, in order to prevent further health problems and encourage a healthy diet, health education must be promoted among the younger people.
1426;The world is experiencing a dramatic increase in population, which is causing problems not only for poor, undeveloped countries, but also for industrialized and developed nations. Describe some of the problems that overpopulation causes, and suggest at least one possible solution.;You should write at least 250 words.You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.Nowadays, the population dramatically in most countries around the world. This is true for the developed and developing nations. Overpopulation a different number of problems. However, the government can these problems in many .There are several problems that the raising number of people in undeveloped countries causes. Firstly, it is very difficult to provide enough food for all people. Secondly, the government limits the number of children per family in school. In addition, in poorest countries usually have , and when the population increases, the number of . Finally, when too many people live on the land, the environment suffers.There are different problems that overpopulation causes in rich nations. Firstly, it is very difficult for governments to provide helpful public services in overcrowded cities. Moreover, there is generally a higher level of crimes being committed, such as drugs abuse, murders, thefts, . often cause by the high rates of unemployment.However, overpopulation problems in nations have two main which they are by governments. Firstly, the government must educate people about limiting the size of the family. For example, in China they have a policy called “one child policy” which limits the size of the family to one or two children, and this is beginning to have an effect on the world’s most crowded nation.To sum up, if the impulsive population increase continues, many more people will die of hunger in the poor countries. Also, in rich nations, the life in the cities will become more and more difficult.; One of the main problems caused by overpopulation is a strain on natural resources. The world population is growing at an unprecedented rate, causing many problems for both rich and poor countries. Overcrowded cities also put a strain on services, leading to poor living conditions. Increasing numbers of people put a strain on the natural resources of food, water and energy, and these are increasingly being depleted. This is followed by a shortage of food and water, and increased greenhouse gas emissions, which hasten climate change. In addition, as a result of overpopulation, the loss of species is increasing as natural habitats are destroyed to accommodate the growing population. One possible solution to this is to implement effective family planning and education programmes. This would reduce the need for social services in developed countries, and increase prosperity in poor countries. In addition, investing in sustainable agriculture, alternative energy and urban planning can help to meet the needs of the growing population and minimize damage to the environment. By educating women and girls and providing them with access to family planning and reproductive health care, governments and international organizations could help people make informed choices about the size of their families, which would help to slow down population growth and reduce poverty. In order to tackle the problem of overpopulation, governments, international organizations and individuals need to work together to promote sustainable development, and ensure a viable future for everyone.
1313;There are many things that can motivate people to perform well in their work. These can include the salary, job satisfaction or the chance to help others. What do you feel is the best motivation to do well at work?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"To perform well in a job, people have to be motivated. There are multiple strategies for employers to incentivise their employees. The most obvious one is the salary; however, job satisfaction and the ability to help people are other methods of improving performance at work.For the majority of the people, receiving their salary at the end of the month is their motivation. This is because money is necessary to fulfill the most basic needs and other materialistic desires. Employees see these opportunities when receiving their salary and therefore work to achieve money. Furthermore, performing well in a job can often lead to promotions with higher pay packages. To receive this, staff have to stand out positively in their jobs. Salary is therefore a key motivational tool for many workforce participants.However, money is far from being the only incentive. Another aspect affecting performance is job satisfaction. If a person is comfortable in their work, they are more likely to perform well. Therefore this motivational tool interlinks with salary, as when people are content and perform well, the chances of promotion increase. For some individuals though, only their passion can drive them. Prime examples for this are humanitarian jobs. The salaries are often not very high, but those choosing to work in this field are often very driven; their passion to help others is prioritised over their own salary.In conclusion, while income might be the most common motivational factor, it is unusual to be the sole incentive for working hard, and some people are motivated wholly due to other reasons."; If you have more than one opinion, give and explain your reasons. When it comes to people's motivation to do well in their work, there are many reasons why people are motivated to do their best, such as the salary, job satisfaction and the chance to help others. Doctors and nurses, for example, are motivated by the chance to save lives and improve the health of their patients. On the other hand, teachers are often motivated by the chance to educate and train young people and make a difference in their lives. Despite the fact that many teachers are underpaid and overworked, they are very dedicated to their work because they feel their work has a meaning and a purpose. Besides, the opportunity to help others can help to build a strong sense of community and solidarity in the workplace. When people feel that they are working towards the same goal of helping others, they are more likely to support and encourage each other. These people often work long hours and in difficult conditions, but they are motivated by the knowledge that their work is making a difference in people's lives. In conclusion, although the salary and job satisfaction are important, I think the chance to help others is the most powerful incentive for people to do their best in their work. This can create a more positive and productive work environment, where employees feel valued and feel encouraged to do their best.
1284;There is a moral necessity today for the richer countries of the world to help the poorer countries develop in terms of feeding the population, education and health care. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The world today is often divided into two categories, more developed and less developed countries. This division is significant in terms of health, wealth and education. To minimise this gap, it is argued that richer countries are morally responsible to support the less wealthy. I, personally, feel that the prosperous countries are obligated and expected to to contribute to the development of countries with weaker economies.To address this argument, the history of the wealthy countries is relevant. Many less developed countries are former colonies, therefore the wealthy countries had a historical impact on the less wealthy. Thus, richer countries’ economies were dependent on the currently less developed countries for their rich status. Furthermore, even today the wealthy countries contribute to the wealth inequality by exploiting the inhabitants of less developed countries, giving workers lower wages than people within their own countries. Due to this dependence on poorer countries and the influence that the richer countries have had on the imbalance, it can be concluded that richer countries are indeed morally obliged to help the less wealthy countries.Opposing this is the view that each country is in charge of their own inhabitants and that therefore they need to provide health, education and basic necessities for themselves. In addition, simply providing these three services would not lead to closing the wealth gap. It would rather be helpful to invest sustainably in poorer countries and help them create their own systems, allowing these countries to be self-sufficient.In conclusion, while there is a moral necessity for wealthy countries to aid the poorer ones, simply providing basic necessities is not sufficient. A more sustainable idea would be to teach countries to plan and provide for themselves by giving economic incentives.; Firstly, food is the basic human right. It is the responsibility of wealthy countries to share their wealth and provide assistance. For example, the United States Food for Peace program has been providing food for countries affected by natural disasters, disasters and conflicts for over sixty years. Hundreds of millions of people in poor countries suffer from hunger and undernourishment, which can lead to serious consequences for their health, productivity and prosperity. Education is the most effective way of development, because it helps individuals and communities to break the cycle of poverty. For example, the United Kingdom Department for International Development has supported education in countries such as Nigeria and Pakistan. Through these efforts, the enrolment rate has increased and the quality of education has improved. Education is the most effective way of development. In addition, health care is also an important part of development, and it is the responsibility of wealthy countries to provide medical assistance, technical assistance and funding to poor countries. For example, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, which is funded by wealthy countries, has helped many people in poor countries to prevent AIDS, TB and malaria. In short, the moral obligation of rich countries to help poor countries develop is undeniable. I believe that it is the responsibility of all countries to help all people have access to basic needs.
1217;There is growing evidence that man-made activities are making global temperatures higher.What might be the man-made causes of temperatures rising? How should we deal with this problem?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In the last years the problem of global warming is becaming more and more debated. One of the main causes of the temperature rising are men-made activities. Almost all the activities made by humans produce a huge impact on the natural environment. For instance, some of the usual activities made daily by people are impacting. Indeed, the chemical products they buy and use as well as the ways of trasportation's abuse can be annoverated among the main reasons for global warming. Lastly, even if it is the more impacting, there is the industral system and their production of slags.The first impact made by men-activities concerns the product they use. There are at least three kinds of products that may cause the rising of temperature. First, there are products like lacquaer and foam. Because they were beed uncontrolled used during the last decades, they have been one of the main causes of the Ozone Hole. Spray products, even if they are just suncream or hair conditionars could be very impacting because of their chemical composition. Another men-activity that impact a lot on the environment concern their use of the way of transportation. Indeed, the abuse of private ways of trasportation caused an increasement of pollution and a dramatic increase of the level of petrol in the environment. Petrol is not only one of the main reason for global warming but also the first responsible for sea's pollution. Furthermore, the dayly use of flight cause pollution in the air and now restriction on the abuse of this way of trasportation are trying to be a kind of solution to the problem.Lastly, one of the main causes of global temperatures higher is the industrial system. Indeed, they used to point to the cheaper solution to produce and eliminate the radioactive waste. The problem of a prodaction that does not take care of the environment pointed to use polluting products and machines. Furthermore, the industrial system point to produce more and more causing the waste of energy and raw materials. For instance, the fashion industry is one of the more pulluting in the world. It abuses of materials and energies whithout caring abuut the waste of them. Finally, the problem of the way in which the industries procede in elimnating waste is crucial. Indeed, in the last years they used to disperse the waste on the sea. This tendecy was increased for two reasosns: saving and speed. These are the two eassential words of industrial system.In conclusion, I think there are two main reasons that cause the raising of global temperatures that can be annoverated among the others. Those that concern the personal and daily activities of men (use of determinate products and ways of trasportation) and then those activities operate by the industrial system.; And the main reason why the temperature is rising is because of two human activities. The first is the production of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, when fossil fuels are burned, such as the production of cars, factories and power plants. These products are emitted into the air, and the heat they contain is trapped, which leads to an increase in global temperatures. To deal with this problem, it is necessary to take a variety of measures. First, the government and industry should invest more in developing renewable energy sources such as wind and solar energy to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. In addition, deforestation not only removes the natural carbon sink but also disrupts the local environment and intensifies the greenhouse effect. If we do not clear forests, we can offset the effects of deforestation. In terms of individual behavior, we can use public transportation, share cars, and drive electric vehicles, and reduce our personal carbon footprint. In Norway, for example, more than half of the new cars sold are electric vehicles. If this trend continues, the temperature will drop, but a combination of individual efforts and changes in the structure of society will be required.
1427;There is no longer enough natural resources to sustain current levels of economic growth. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Recently, the natural resources risen dramatically across the world due to population growth. Some people state that we enough resources. However, there are some individuals who disagree with this opinion. In this essay, the issues behind this phenomenon will be examined.On the one hand, some people state that if will continue to we cannot have a comfortable life because natural resources are limited. According to a if this situation will continue, the petrol will in 2050. Moreover, it is widely said that the will increase. This will make the amount of natural .On the other hand, there are some individuals who disagree with above-mentioned perception. The natural resources will technology. For example, the of technology such as cars a positive impact the society. By using this, we can the consumption of natural resources. Eventually, we will not need natural fuel. In my opinion, of natural is , I think the loss of it a negative impact the society because won’t have a comfortable life any more.In conclusion, I agree with the idea that there is no longer enough natural resources to sustain this situation. In order to our life, the governments countries should tackle this issue.; For the first part, there is no doubt that natural resources, such as water, oil and minerals, are being depleted at an alarming rate. On the other hand, the notion that there are no longer enough natural resources to support current economic growth has sparked intense debate. I partly agree with the thesis, but I have reservations about the last part of the thesis. In fact, the World Wildlife Fund estimates that by 2025, the world's population will need the resources of two planets to support its consumption patterns. This raises concerns about the viability of current growth models. The extraction and consumption of natural resources lead to severe deforestation, climate change and pollution, which have a direct impact on human health. Fortunately, technological advances and human ingenuity have always led to solutions that have made progress in resource constraints. For example, the development of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, has made it possible to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. However, I disagree with the thesis that there is no hope. Moreover, a circular economy model and the use of recycled materials have reduced the level of waste and enhanced resource efficiency. Such innovations have shown that economic growth and sustainable development are not mutually exclusive. Ultimately, the most sustainable solution to the problem is to combine economic growth and resource conservation. The use of sustainable resources, the development of green technology and the encouragement of the use of renewable energy sources would alleviate the burden on natural resources.
1324;These days, many young people are not spending their weekends and holidays doing outdoor activities such as hiking or mountaineering. Why is that happening? How can they be encouraged to spend more time in the natural environment?;Nowadays, the younger generation tends to avoid recreational activities such as hiking or alpinism. It seems that young people prefer to spend their weekends indoors, gaming or engaging in other online activities. If that is the case, by promoting sports more actively and organising sports competitions, the schools could counteract this trend.Living in the era of technology, the wide availability and variety of online entertainment are compelling young people to spend a lot of their free time indoors, using their gadgets. Numerous relatively cheap forms of amusement, such as online games, videos, audiobooks and plenty of other activities, tempt teenagers to stay at home and lead more sedentary lifestyles. A recent survey revealed that the vast majority of students would prefer spending their weekends playing computer games, rather than in the nature. That is one clear reason why our modern youth is less interested in recreational sports.To address this issue, the school management could intervene and offer a better range of outdoor sports activities and competitions, both within the school curriculum and as extra-curricular activities. For example, high schools could increase the number of weekly football, running and climbing classes, and organise competitions at the end of each term. As a result, pushed by their desire to win, students would do more walking, jogging, running and mountaineering during the school term, in preparation for the competition. This would reduce the time spent online, lessen the students’ dependence on the Internet for entertainment, and eventually boost their desire to spend more time enjoying the natural environment.To sum up, screen addiction plays a major role in young people’s avoidance of various outdoor activities. Opening up more recreational sports and offering frequent competitions on school grounds is a great way to motivate more students to spend their leisure time in the nature.; One reason for the shift in attitude is the increasing attraction of digital entertainment and social media. Young people now spend their leisure time playing games, browsing the Internet and participating in on-line communities, instead of going out into nature. The loss of outdoor activities, especially during the weekend and holidays, is of great concern. Another reason is the lack of awareness of the benefits of being in nature. Young people are unaware of the beneficial effect of outdoor activities on their physical and mental health. The increasing urbanization has reduced the available outdoor space and thus the opportunities for outdoor activities such as hiking and mountaineering. Also, investing in urban green spaces and public parks would increase the opportunities for young people to be with nature. To encourage young people to spend more time in nature, it is important to promote the benefits of outdoor activities through schools and the media. School trips and community outings are also good ways to get them into nature. Developing a deeper appreciation for nature and allowing young people to explore it safely and with enjoyment would help them benefit from its many advantages. It would not only benefit them individually, but also create a sense of responsibility towards the environment among young people.
919;To be labelled a ‘Work of Art’, a painting, sculpture or other art form should display certain qualities that are unique. However, over the past century there has been a decline in the quality of prize-winning artwork and it is now possible for quite ordinary pieces of art to be labelled ‘masterpieces ’ whilst true works of art pass unnoticed.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;For centuries, artworks have been titled  'Work of Art' based on their extraordinary qualities. However, some people argue that nowadays, the standards are decreasing and the labelling of substandard artworks as 'masterpieces' has become ubiquitous. The upcoming essay will discuss why I agree that original paintings are being neglected while usual ones are being praised.Firstly, the superficial nature of humans is responsible for this change. These days, people do not see the meaning behind the painting or the message the artist is trying to convey rather they buy those paintings which are popular and contemporary. To illustrate it further, in art auctions it can be seen that when one person bids on one painting, no matter whether it is good or bad, others also start putting their money on it. Thus it is clear that normal art forms are winning prizes due to public attention.Secondly, some artists might bribe the organizers of exhibitions to promote their canvas. Indeed, there have been some recorded instances when artists were caught while signing up deals to increase the sales of their work. If a certain artwork receives publicity then it is impossible that it would not have an influence on the public. This type of promotion skews a person's opinion about a certain picture and so are forced to think about purchasing it, leaving behind original ones. Therefore, it is apparent that the diabolical activities of painters are responsible for their works being labelled as masterpieces.To conclude, the maintenance of social position and influence of painters are the prime causes for the popularity of ordinary artworks and the negligence of true works. Hence I agree with the given statement.; In my opinion, the quality of prize-winning artwork has not declined in the past century. It has changed and the criteria have been modified. For example, Marcel Duchamp’s Fountain of 1917, a urinal signed R. Mutt,1 caused a great upheaval in the artistic world by challenging the traditional idea of art. As a result, the focus has shifted from technical skill to originality. Similarly, the art world has become more diverse and includes artists from different backgrounds and styles. The art market has expanded and the Internet has democratized the way we experience and interact with art. Andy Warhol’s soup-can paintings of 1962 challenged the distinction between art and mediocrity. I think the decline in quality of prize-winning art is a subjective perception. A more accessible art world has led to a broader definition of what constitutes a work of art. At its heart, a work of art should inspire, challenge and engage us, regardless of its technical skill or adherence to the established artistic norms. The art world is constantly changing and evolving and what is considered a masterpiece today may not have been seen as such in the past. As our understanding of art grows, so does our appreciation for the diverse creative expressions around us.
1338;Today children are spending much more time watching TV compared to the past. Why do you think this happens? Is this a positive or a negative change?;"A trend has emerged in the last two decades with youngsters watching more TV than ever before. One of the main reasons behind this issue is the recent advancements in technology in gaming and film industries. This tendency has both pros and cons, and will be further discussed in this essay.The latest developments in video game consoles attracted both children and adults to spend extra time watching TV, compared to the past. With interactive gaming characters and high quality graphics, children are more likely to spend long hours playing games in front of the TV. A recent survey showed that TV addiction among young people, for example, has significantly increased from 5% to 80%, which was supposedly caused by the introduction of advanced gaming consoles. This increase is also partially due to films, drama series and cartoons being easily available on pirated websites and various gaming platforms.This trend has had more negative than positive effects on young citizens. More time spent watching TV adversely affects the mental and physical wellbeing of a child. For instance, the obesity ratio among young individuals in the past 10 years has risen dramatically; this has caused further health problems such as anxiety and depression. However, TV can also be used in a positive way. It is a great source of information that can help youngsters increase their knowledge and succeed in their future careers.In conclusion, recent breakthroughs in technology are driving up the amount of time our youngsters are spending in front of their TV screens. This can do more harm than good if we don’t regulate the use of TV, but parents have the power to make TV time useful and beneficial for their children."; It can be attributed to many reasons. In the first place, the ease of access to TVs and other means of visual acquaintances has made it possible for children to watch the tube for long hours. On the other hand, the number of channels and programmes has also increased. Also, the fact that parents are busy at work and other activities, and cannot find time to take care of their children and bring them up, has contributed to this. However, this change is largely negative. There are many disadvantages of long hours of watching the tube. First, it is a passive activity that prevents children from playing, socializing and going out, all of which are essential for their mental, emotional and physical development. Secondly, it may contain many immoral scenes, violence, advertisements and stereotypes, which can seriously affect their mentality and habits. So, it is very important to raise children with a minimum of TV, and to encourage them to develop their creative, sporting and social skills. Parents and carers should be aware of the risks of excessive viewing and take measures to monitor and restrict their children’s viewing and to encourage more balanced and active activities such as reading, sports and creativity. In this way, we can help children develop healthy habits and skills that will be useful to them throughout their lives.
603;Today family members do not eat meals together. Why does this happen? Is this a positive or negative developmentGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Dinner tables are no longer a place for family reunion in today's society. Reasons from many aspects account for this phenomenon which pose a huge threat to the happiness of family and the harmony of society.Causes vary from person to person. Some people, especially the young believing that conflicts are common on dinner tables, tend to have meals with their friends rather than their family members. But most people are deprived of their rights by the development of society. Too busy to get home at dinner time, people have to eat meals near workplace. Also, with the job diversity increasing, rarely can family members with different timetables eat meals at the same period. For instance, a bank agent getting home at 6 pm tends to miss her doctor husband leaving home at 5 pm for emergency work.It is the advantages of sharing meals with family that attach great importance to this event. Time for communication is so critical that families lacking such opportunities are often full of misunderstandings and quarrels. Not only can this development increase the divorce rate but it may also decrease the marriage rate. Because support and care from family, the previous harbor, is deprived and people see no significance from getting married. With such phenomenon prevailing, the negative emotions may take advantage in the society. Loneliness, distress and helplessness stike those always eating alone.In a nutshell, taking the damage to both families and societies into consideration, various solutions should be put forward to the roots behind the situation.; They say it's the pressure of life, work, school, and other activities. People are pressed for time, so they eat alone or on the run. People who eat together are in contact with each other and create memories and events. The development is largely negative, in my opinion. It also leads to a less healthy diet because people are more likely to eat ready-made or fast food, which often contains high levels of fat, salt and sugar. Research has shown that frequent family meals are associated with better communication, well-being and even education in children. In my own family, we have made an effort to eat together a few times a week, and as a result, we have developed a healthier diet and a greater sense of unity. Finally, the decline in family meals is a negative development that can have far-reaching effects on our physical and mental well-being. As individuals, we need to appreciate the importance of family meals and strive to maintain this important tradition in our increasingly busy lives. By making time for the family and making an effort to eat together, we can maintain a sense of unity, promote healthy habits and create good memories.
883;Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;There is no doubt that nowadays advertising plays a very strong role in saling goods. The high rate of sales does not always mean the real needs of some goods. In this essay, i will discuss both views and draw my personal conclusion.In terms of advertising's power in increasing sales of popular consumer goods, advertising has an essencial role these days in sales. The main reason given to support this claim is advertisnig attracts people and inform people about the new and special products in a very special way. To illustrate, using social media for marketing and advertising raise sales dramatecly. People spend most of their times to watch what is in the social media and that means social media is the best way to do your marketing.However, some people say that people buy these products not because they really need them but because they like the way that was used to advertise these products. On the other hand, some times people purchase goods because they have seen them or heard about them from others or from the social media not due to their needs of these products.In conclusion, I believe that increasing the sales of some popular consumer goods show how strong is advertising and how advertising plays a crucial role in saling products. Also, smart business owners should think about advertising as a fast way to sale their goods. As was previously menthond, people can be attracted by all kinds of advertising and that definitly lead to increasing the sale rate.; In my opinion, I agree to a large extent that advertising plays a significant role in the success of the products, but I also believe that the needs of society can not be completely ignored. This idea that high sales of popular consumer goods are mainly due to the power of advertising and not to the real needs of society has become a controversial issue. Various opinions have been expressed in this regard, and some of them support the idea that advertising influences people's needs. For example, the annual release of new mobile phones creates a frenzy among consumers, who are forced to have the latest device to be considered advanced and relevant. Through advertising and the use of stories, the need for a product can be created without it being a real need. However, it should be noted that there are some products that respond to real societal needs. For example, medical supplies, food, and clothing are largely in demand because people need these items to survive and to live at least the minimum standard of life. In my opinion, although advertising certainly influences the behavior of consumers and leads to high sales, this is not the only cause. The real needs of society also play a role in determining the demand for certain products. In addition, some products may be created to meet a certain need or solve a particular problem, such as appliances that save energy or water treatment systems. The relationship between advertising, sales and societal needs is complex and requires a careful and balanced analysis. A balanced approach sees both sides as influencing each other and influencing the way consumers perceive their real needs.
1328;Today’s young generation is facing many problems at school and at home. What are the problems? What can parents do to help their teenage children?;"Young people today are under a lot of pressure, which seems to come from many directions. The problems they are experiencing happen not only at school, but also at home, and it seems that without adult guidance, our young generation will continue to struggle.Teenage years have never been simple, and many would agree that the amount of challenges has only increased with the passage of time. Bullying has been a problem for quite a while, and children and adolescents would have experienced it at school in the past, but then it would stop at home. At present, however, things have been made worse by social media penetrating the supposedly safe space of our teenagers. The unfortunate behaviour of their peers can now reach them even in their bedrooms, causing them constant distress.Another issue troubling many young people is the pressure to succeed by their families. Whether at school or at home, they often feel as if they are not smart enough, which creates overwhelm and despair. Understandably, their parents are pursuing a worthy goal of ensuring their children get a great start in life; however, many teens feel that they are failing their families when they don’t live up to their expectations. This often leads to dishonest and unethical behaviour, such as cheating on tests or plagiarising other students’ work. When uncovered, these incidents have a profound effect on young people’s future careers, not to mention their emotional well-being.It is hard to underestimate the importance of parental support to navigating life as a young person. From helping teens build a positive body image and self-esteem, to handling classmates’ difficult behaviour, to guidance where study is concerned, parents can make a world of difference. Talking to their sons and daughters about matters that worry them, listening and making non-judgmental suggestions are great ways to help. Getting a professional involved where necessary and engaging with teachers, councilors and coaches is another opportunity for parents to provide assistance. Last but not least, parents can make their children better and happier people by simply giving them unconditional love.To sum up, being a young person in the modern world isn’t easy. By banding together and paying careful attention to their teens, families can help them overcome any obstacles to becoming successful adults."; At school, the students are under the pressure of homework, examinations and other activities. They are full of worries and even in anxiety. At home, they are subject to the frequent insults of bullying, coercion and exploitation. Then, there are many family conflicts, no communication with parents and few rights. Finally, parents' high expectations and strict discipline often lead to the development of rebellion and suffocation. We all know that parents can only help their teenage children. What can parents do? First, they should listen to the children honestly, trust them and encourage them to express their views, and the children will feel comfortable and more confident to talk about their feelings. Secondly, they should pay attention to the activities of their children on the Internet, and discuss the potential risks of social media. Thirdly, they should let their children participate in extra-curricular activities and hobbies that help them to be healthy and strong, and give them emotional support. Finally, they should live with the teenagers and work together to create a healthy and happy family environment. , so that teenagers can get over their own problems, and help their children to build their own moral and physical strength.
1310;Tourism today creates a variety of problems, such as pollution due to flights, transport and dirty water.Do you think that governments should impose extra taxes on flights or accommodation to restrict today’s tourism industry?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Travelling today is simple to the extent that within twelve hours one can travel from Europe to Singapore, crossing nearly the whole globe. Based on this simplicity, tourism has changed significantly over the years. While in the past a family would be proud to drive two hours to a lake, many families now think nothing of travelling to the far side of the world. This also has a downside as increased pollution is a result. Extra taxes on flights or accommodation have therefore been offered as a solution so as to increase the cost of tourism and reduce its popularity.No matter what major transportation is used, travelling creates pollution. To decrease the amount of pollution caused by tourism, the tourism industry itself would have to be weakened. If these increased taxes are based on travelling distance, people would be more willing to stay closer to their home country, as for many even a slight increase would mean that their planned holidays would be too expensive. Accommodation taxes would raise holiday costs no matter the distance travelled. Therefore, if increased taxes were levied on travel and accommodation, tourism and therefore pollution would decrease.On the other hand, the main transport methods that would be impacted by imposing extra taxes would be communal ones, such as planes, trains and buses, and increasing the taxes would also impact non-tourists. Also, holidays are a vital part of ordinary people’s lives, as they escape from work and stress, and get to spend valuable time with their families. Stopping people travelling would greatly impact some simple pleasures of ordinary life.In conclusion, while tourism impacts the environment significantly, simply introducing extra taxes on transport or accommodation is a drastic measure. It could be more valuable to change the methods of transportation to decrease pollution, instead making people stay close to home.; A. In recent years, the tourism industry has grown rapidly. There are millions of tourists visiting different parts of the world every day. In my opinion, taxing flights and accommodations can reduce the negative effects of tourism, discourage people from traveling, and earn money to pay for the damage caused by tourism. In this regard, the question arises: should governments tax flights and accommodations in order to restrict today's tourism industry? To the contrary, this is an incentive for the tourism industry to move towards sustainable practices, such as investing in renewable energy, reducing waste and building eco-friendly hotels. For example, Venice, which is now plagued by congestion and pollution, has introduced a tourist tax to limit the number of visitors and pay for the conservation of the city. New Zealand also has a tourist tax to protect its pristine environment and unique species. However, it is important to maintain a balance between regulating tourism and protecting the benefits of local economies. In addition, the proceeds of these taxes will be used to support the local community and cultural heritage, so that the benefits of tourism can be shared by everyone. An appropriate tax system, taking into account the special needs and challenges of each tourist destination, can minimize the harm of tourism, while allowing people to explore the world's diverse cultures and natural wonders. Too much taxation can cause small businesses and local communities to suffer.
861;Traffic and housing problems could be solved by moving large companies, factories and their employees to the countryside.Do you agree or disagree?;Many metropolises are facing challenges, including traffic gams and serious lacking of housing available for families to live, particular in the developed countries. The governments are looking for a way to lessen the volume of traffic in the cities and to increase the number of housing provision over the metropolises. Some people advocate the businesses including large corporations and factories along with their employees moving to the suburbs which is the best way to figure out the metropolitan problems. Is this a sheer solution for these challenges faced by the cities?Economy boom in a country is accompanied with a number of problems incurred in the cities due to the multitudes living in there. It is no wonder that metropolises represent more job opportunities available and better education system to next generations. These are strong pull factors appealing people to stay in the cities despite the higher cost in living. A larger number of populations in the cities not only result in a severe shortage of housing where there is a higher demand of housing over the available supply, but also bring the higher volume of traffic across the cities, particular in a peak hour when a thousand and one employees commuting to work and students going to schools. Some people believe the working location shifting to rural areas is a solution that enables to lessen the frequent usage of roads in cities. Simultaneously, it is assumed that the housing issue can be solved naturally arising from the migration of their employees into the suburban town next to their working place.The business allocated to suburbs alone is rarely considered enough to tackle these problems. A place to live requires the basic facilities to serve for clothing, food, housing and transportation which are basic needs of human. If there is a working place and residential area only in the suburban town without any infrastructures, people have no choice to drive their vehicles back and forth between cities and their living places for the general consumption. As a consequence, the traffic congestion in cities will be worsen combining with the significant deterioration of air quality in the countryside due to an increase in the emission of the greenhouse gases. Therefore, the governments play a key role to establish a neighborhood which could be self-sufficient communities outside of their larger metropolitan areas. This may be a feasible and effective way to minimize the metropolitan issues.My own view is that the shifting strategies in suburbs can help lessen the challenges faced by metropolises. But the governments should take the smart planning into consideration in which the employment bases with the living infrastructures are developed in the suburban town.; In my opinion, I partly agree with the sentence. The idea of relocating large companies, factories and employees to the countryside to solve the problem of traffic and housing in cities is an interesting idea. But if this idea seems to be a viable solution, it also has its disadvantages. By moving large companies and factories to the countryside, there will be a reduction in the number of people commuting to and from the city, which will relieve traffic and air pollution, and at the same time the demand for housing in the city will also be reduced, which may lead to more affordable rents for urban residents. But this move can also lead to the loss of employment in the city and disrupt the social life of the communities where these industries are located. For example, in the countryside, the necessary support for large-scale industrial activity may not be in place and, if it is established, it may be too expensive to establish such a support. Relocating companies and factories to the countryside can also lead to the loss of employment in the city, which can lead to unemployment in the countryside. In conclusion, moving large companies and factories to the countryside will not directly solve the traffic and housing problems in cities, but it is not a simple solution, and a more complex solution, for example, to improve urban planning and public transport, may be a more effective solution to the complex traffic and housing problems of cities.
1229;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;While some people argue that equal numbers of male and female students should be accepted in every major, I personally disagree with this statement.There are a number of arguments that can support my stance. To begin with, it is impossible to enroll equal genders of students in every subject. It is true that some faculties are underrepresented by a particular gender. For example, STEM subjects usually have more male students than females, but the opposite is true in educational-related subjects, which phenomenon seems to violate the principle that we fight endeavor today, gender equality. Therefore, people want to accept equal numbers of students to achieve a gender balance in every subject. However, the reality is that different genders prefer to study different subjects themselves, but not because of the unequal opportunity. According to one of the research, women show a higher interest in subjects like education, psychology and arts rather than science-related subjects. As a result, it is apparent that admitting equivalent proportions of male and female students can hardly be achieved.In addition, it will deprive students of chances to make their own choices if universities enroll both genders equally in every subject mandatorily. It should be noted that it is students' right to select the subjects freely in college. If students cannot register for the subjects they want to study just because there are not enough quotas left for particular gender of students, or they are forced to study some subjects they are not interested in just because they need to fulfill the gender requirement in the class, it will hinder students' learning in the long-run.To conclude, universities should not enroll equal gender students in every subject as it is impossible to achieve and may deprive students the freedom to choose the major they want to study.;" In my opinion, I partially agree with this statement. This view has led to a hot debate. Some argue that this policy will help to achieve gender equality; others argue that it can lead to discrimination and lower educational standards. Many universities have introduced successful programs to encourage female students to enter these subjects, which have resulted in significant increases in the percentage of women enrolled and graduating. On the one hand, an equal number of students in each subject can help to eliminate the gap between the number of men and women in certain subjects. For example, in the field of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), where men have always been in the majority, it will be possible to achieve a more equal environment for women and men. However, some subjects will naturally attract more students from one gender, due to their interests or abilities. In my view, this policy can discriminate against the best students from one gender in favor of the less qualified students from the other. The choice of university subjects must be flexible and nuanced. For example, nursing and care for children are mainly women, while engineering and computer science are mainly men. However, this does not mean that these subjects should be equally attended by women and men; instead, we should strive to achieve diversity and equality, but without lowering the quality of education."
1433;Universities should allocate the same amount of money to their sport activities as they allocate to their libraries. Do you agree or disagree?;Yes, I do feel that universities should have an equal budget for their libraries as well as sport activities. It is our general belief that a good player can not be good student and hence we restrict our children’s sport activities at college level. Moreover, an academic degree has much more value than sport activities which naturally compels students to focus more on their studies than their interest in sport.Most of the universities keep sports at of their priority list, good players do not get enough facilities and to improve their skills and eventually they their interest.Universities can play substantial role in shaping this upcoming talent by providing good trainers and which is otherwise too expensive to afford. Also it will attract other students sports and inculcate importance of physical fitness in them.Universities should produce in all fields rather than only concentrating on progress of scholars. Hence, I feel that universities should allot equal amounts of money to as well as sport activities.; To what extent do you agree or disagree? As much as I recognize the role of sports in the health and welfare of students, as well as the importance of university life, I do not think it is a good idea to give sports the same financial support as libraries. Libraries are a much larger share of the student population and serve everyone who needs to finish the course and research, while sports only a smaller, although still considerable, part of the student population. This is not so with sports, which although help the health of the student, but not so much with the academic mission of the university. Universities should, therefore, put the different demands of sports and the library in balance. Moreover, the libraries need a large amount of money for a larger building, new technology and personnel to be able to maintain and develop their collections, and therefore it is not the best to spend equal money on sports. Then, of course, the students would have to have fewer available resources and therefore fewer opportunities to complete their studies. By focusing on library funding, universities can make sure that students have the resources they need to succeed in their studies, while also making sure they have the opportunity to practice sports and other extra-academic activities.
1387;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;Today computers are used almost everywhere, it is impossible to imagine our life without PCs, Internet, mobile phones and other computer devices. It is reasonable to think that people look forward to the future of computers., computers make our life easier, we can easily get information about any product we plan to buy or place we plan to visit in a second using a personal computer and . Scientists predict that in the nearest future it will be possible to smell a new perfume using the Internet and watch 3D scenes at home like we do in the movie theater. According to forecasts of HR agencies machines will replace jobs of cashiers, and civil and military pilots. Some corporations in Japan are already sellinghousewife-robots, which help old people to keep their homes clean.Despite the fact that computers help us, they make us dependent. Apparently, people spend more time behind monitors than ever before. And some of them feel a need for more time to be spent with people in live contact. In addition, a breakdown of one of the important modules of a specific computer can entail serious consequences. to mention the computer problem that occurred in the end of 1990s, a problem related to the coming year 2000 (Y2K) and catastrophes that were predicted. Fortunately imminent disasters did not happen. However, it is difficult to imagine what could if all the predictions came true.We live in a technological era, computers penetrated everywhere with all benefits they provide and all dangers they hide. However we are satisfied with them and sometimes we even thank them because they help us in communicating, studying, doing business, entertaining and saving lives in critical situations.; In future they will probably be used more in important areas such as medicine, to help doctors with complicated operations and to diagnose illnesses more precisely. As the development of the computer continues to accelerate, it will find ever more useful applications. This increasing dependence of people on the machines is a topic of debate. But the advantages of dependence on them are obvious - they can be used to increase efficiency, precision and speed. They can also be used to manage natural resources more effectively, to predict natural disasters and to help people live more effectively. Finally, they will be used in space research, helping us to explore space in ever greater detail. It is this dependence which has raised questions about security and job security. It makes business run faster, more accurately and efficiently. In conclusion, while it is obvious that the benefits of this dependence are obvious, it is also important to recognize the disadvantages. By acknowledging both the benefits and the disadvantages, we can make sure that we use the computers to our advantage, without compromising our well-being and our humanity. In addition, the more we rely on them, the more we lose contact with our traditional skills, and the more we are isolated from human interaction, the lower our emotional intelligence. By being able to understand the consequences of our actions, we can then take advantage of the advantages of technology and minimize its disadvantages.
1396;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in the future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;In the last two decades cybernetics have experienced a major breakthrough .This led to the utilization of computers in nearly all parts of our daily life, from personal computers to the ones performing complicated surgeries. Surely the uptake of this technology facilitates a lot of difficult tasks but is this excessive ripping the warmth out of our lives? .Most of the daily tasks individual experiences are time and effort consuming. These two qualities could be tremendously saved by the use of computers. The average period required to prepare a decent meal for a middle-class family is around an hour to hour and a half when using traditional methods. This time could be literally reduced to half if computerized are used instead. Moreover, a busy businessman is enabled to easily close a profitable deal with just a touch highly programmed laptop while enjoying his family vacation and not having to exert an extra effort of traveling long distances in order to a deal.On the other hand, new generations are growing remarkably dependent on these modern utilities, which makes them handicapped when it comes to a cup of tea. , psychologists suggest that one of the main reasons for rate increase is the recent electric inventions. This is due to the fact that humans by nature stay emotionally healthy through socializing, but due to the importance of modern technology to maintain a financially satisfying standard of life they gradually themselves. As time passes by each of these individuals gets stuck in a vicious circle of loneliness that eventually leads to suicidal attempts especially among youngsters.In conclusion, similarly to every other invention computers have their benefits and drawbacks, I personally think it all depends upon how we use the given tools . Moderation is the key here to keep the balance and allow us to live in harmony.; As technology advances, it seems likely that in the future they will be used for even more complex and inventive tasks. The invention of the computer has had a revolutionary effect on how we live and work. Virtual reality and augmented reality are likely to be able to merge with reality and transform the way we learn, socialize and have fun. They may be used to manage large amounts of data in climate science and medicine and lead to discoveries and new knowledge. This growing dependence on technology may cause a loss of jobs as automation replaces human workers, and may also affect issues of privacy and security. But there are also concerns about possible dangers and disadvantages. They may be used to improve our transport systems and energy supplies, making life more efficient and sustainable. But the development and use of these machines should be balanced against their limitations and dangers. As they develop and become more useful, they must not be allowed to replace human interaction and human thought. The homogenization of information and the spread of disinformation through digital media may have unintended consequences for our society and culture. If we are aware of the risks, we can plan to manage them and ensure a more sustainable future for everyone.
1356;What are the difficulties of learning a foreign language, and how to overcome them?;Many people believe that learning a foreign language is a very difficult task. What are the most difficult things about learning a foreign language? What is the best way to overcome them? Explain and include your personal experience or knowledge of these problems.It is true that acquiring new language skills is by no means an easy task. Language learners might encounter several challenges such as unfamiliar accents or grammar structures a foreign language. However, in my opinion, such difficulties can be tackled by a well-rounded education system.When it comes to languages, it is undeniably crucial to get used to a native accent and intonation for effective communication. However, picking up an accurate accent can be enormously difficult, especially for adult learners because of their lack of language learning ability. If a language learner has an unrecognisable accent and intonation, they would not be understood by native speakers. On top of that, each language has different grammar and typical grammatical sequencing of words. For example, Korean sentences always end with verbs whilst English not, which means that a Korean English-learner should the correct order of words.Despite the aforementioned difficulties, I strongly believe that everyone can master a foreign language when a couple of feasible steps are taken. Firstly, it is more important than anything to start learning a new language at a young age. By incorporating foreign language programmes in the primary school curriculum, children can easily be exposed to languages of the world and eventually acquire language skills without difficulties. Secondly, the government can financially subsidise schools to run student exchange programmes that help adolescents to get experiences abroad and make friends overseas while improving their foreign language in a way.In conclusion, I believe that individuals can have difficulties in learning a new language because of different accents and unfamiliar grammar, however, these problems can be overcome by a good quality of education system subsidised by governments.The writer covered the task by talking about some difficult aspects of learning a new language and steps to overcome them. The ideas are presented in an orderly way, their logical sequencing and the use of paragraphing make this essay easy to follow. Skillful use of linking words and expressions helps the writer maintain coherence and cohesion. Word choice needs some more attention in this essay (see suggested corrections for expressions underlined in blue), however, overall this essay seems to be worthy of IELTS Band 8.; The first difficulty is the pronunciation of foreign sounds and tones. Many languages have phonetic features that do not exist in the mother tongue, which is difficult to recognize and recognize. Another difficulty is the acquisition of a large number of words, expressions and idioms. The grammar and syntax of a foreign language may differ significantly from the grammar and syntax of the mother tongue, which leads to further confusion and difficulties in constructing clear and meaningful sentences. Finally, it is difficult to understand the subtleties of cultural differences and the context of words in different languages, which can lead to misunderstandings and misunderstandings. However, there are several methods to overcome these difficulties. Just keep practicing every day, even if only for a few minutes. These exercises help to get used to new words and grammar, and also help to build self-confidence. With a positive and positive attitude towards learning, the acquisition of a foreign language is a rewarding and enriching experience that brings a broader perspective and facilitates international understanding. By accepting the difficulties and applying effective learning methods, we will be able to overcome these difficulties and open the door to a new world of communication and intercultural understanding.
1348;When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers (agree/disagree);When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers for people to spend their free time. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Sample EssaySome people argue that town planners should have a preference for more parks and gyms to be created than business districts and shopping malls. While I understand the concerns of people who hold this opinion, it seems to me that shopping centers are just as important as parks and gyms in a town.There are reasons why public facilities are crucial to city inhabitants. First of all, they provide suitable spaces and equipment for people to exercise. For example, people can go jogging in the park and play tennis or basketball at the sports stadium. That helps to keep their bodies fit and it also elevates their mood during the day. Besides, parks and sports facilities are good spots for people to socialize with their neighbors. People can connect with others when they are playing sports or talking casually with passers by in the park. A harmonious relationship between residents helps build a caring and friendly neighborhood.Although parks and gyms give the town dwellers all kinds of benefits, I would like to point out the importance of shopping malls to the district. Firstly, a shopping center could make shopping more convenient for the local residents. It would enable them to easily purchase things in town and transport them home with less effort and at lower cost. They would not need to spend extra money on transportation or shipping of the goods. Secondly, a shopping mall can provide employment. Locals can find work in retail, maintenance or security of the mall, hence earning an income to support their families.In conclusion, although parks and sports facilities serve as places for exercise and social activities for city dwellers, I believe that shopping centers are equally important, since they can provide job opportunities and convenience to the town residents.This essay would score well on Task Achievement because it addresses all parts of the question, discusses reasons for and against building more parks than shopping malls and expresses the opinion of the writer. The main ideas are organized well and explained coherently. The range of vocabulary is adequate for the requirements of the task response. Overall, this essay could get Band 8 in IELTS.; According to the view that parks and sports facilities should be built in new towns, they provide a lot of benefits for the residents of new towns. First of all, they are green spaces where residents can exercise, relax and socialize. Secondly, public parks and sports facilities make new towns more beautiful and more sustainable. In the increasingly urbanized era, public parks and sports facilities are a necessary oasis that can enhance physical health, mental health and community solidarity. By increasing the construction area of public parks and sports facilities, new towns can cultivate healthier and happier people. On the contrary, shopping centers, although important for the economy, cannot provide as many benefits as public parks and sports facilities. Green areas also maintain air quality, prevent the urban heat island phenomenon and help protect local biological diversity. In the end, the construction of public parks and sports facilities in new towns is more forward-looking. The rise of e-commerce has reduced the demand for shopping malls. Building public parks and sports facilities is more in line with the current trend of people's livelihood. It not only solves the problem of public health, but also promotes the harmony of people's hearts and souls, and finally creates a town that is lively, livable and sustainable.
47;While many people go to university for academic study, more people should be encouraged to do vocational training because there is a lack of qualified workers such as electricians and plumbers. Do you agree or disagree?;Some believe that people should be encouraged more to study practical courses than going to university to fulfill the lack of workforce in practical areas. I agree with this proposal to some degree, because, from my knowledge, there is a lack in both fields, academic and vocational experts. Moreover, academic studies and vocational ones are equally important for every society, and not everybody can study the same thing, so both studies should be encouraged.Qualified workers and professional academics are equally needed in many parts of the world. This is because as the population grows the people's needs do it too, and this happens in all shapes and areas. While living in Argentina, I noticed the need of professionals in fields such as medicine and technology, especially robotics. In England, however, I observed the lack of plumers and carpenters. Consequently, every country needs different things.Furthermore, if strong encouragement is put on studying vocational courses only, this could be detrimental to the academic field. Essentially, both study systems are equally important. A hospital needs doctors to treat people as well as electricians to maintain the building. Besides, not everybody is good at everything. Some might be good at performing practical tasks and some good at thinking. In my family, I am the one who studied at the university, but my sister studied dressmaking. Both of us have jobs nowadays.In conclusion, I believe that the two types of studies should be stimulated. Countries worldwide are in lack of different experts, either in the vocational or academic field, hence, both workers are equally essential and needed. Besides and more importantly, not every individual can study the same subject or perform in the same area.; I agree. Vocational schools provide practical skills and experience that are essential for success in this profession. Furthermore, there are many advantages to vocational training, such as shorter study times, so students can start working sooner, and cheaper tuition. Academic studies are often more theoretical and students who leave school do not have the skills to fill this gap in the labor market. Vocational training can therefore help to fill the labor gap in the short term and thus contribute to the prosperity of the economy and society as a whole. In addition, vocational education leads to good salaries and electricians and plumbers are among the most demanded and highest paid professions. Therefore, it is a viable alternative for people who want to learn a profession without having to borrow a large amount of money. Now it is important to increase the focus on vocational training and provide sufficient support and resources for those who want to pursue this career. The lack of qualified workers in these professions is a serious problem that needs to be solved. Vocational training can provide people with the skills and knowledge they need to fill this gap and thus help society develop and prosper.
1380;Why do criminals commit another offence after being punished?;"Many offenders commit more crimes after serving the first punishment. Why is this happening, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?It is true that some criminals commit crimes again after they have been punished. While there are several reasons for this alarming trend, some effective measures can be taken by governments to tackle this problem.There are two main reasons for re-offenders. Firstly, the prison system can make the situation worse. Criminals put together in prison and they make friends with other offenders. While they are locked up in prison, they do not have much to do there, and they would exchange information about what they have done before they came to the prison or they may plan crimes with other inmates. Secondly, offenders often do not have any other means of earning money. They are poor, uneducated and lacking skills needed to maintain a job. Also, a criminal record makes finding a job difficult as people usually avoid hiring .To solve this problem, governments should focus on rehabilitation of criminals rather than punishment. Above all, prisons need vocational training which inmates to prepare for life outside the prison. They can learn practical skills such as computer programming, car maintenance and graphic design. In this way, they can be hired for a position that requires this certain knowledge and skills. Community service is another way to reform offenders. Rather than being locked up in prison with other inmates, offenders can help society and become useful to their local community, and these activities would eliminate the negative influence that prisons can have.In conclusion, it is true the one of the problems our community; it can be solved by focusing rather than punishment itself.This is a good essay. The requirements of the task statement are covered, the reasoning is logical and presented in a coherent, easy to follow way, the range of vocabulary is wide enough and the writer shows fluency and flexibility. Some minor errors in this essay include word choice and preposition errors (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows suggested corrections). Overall this looks like an IELTS Band 8 essay."; In spite of the fact that punishment is a deterrent, there are still a lot of people who have been punished for the crime and who still commit another crime. There are many reasons for this phenomenon. Many of the criminals have other problems, such as poverty, lack of education and drug addiction, which are not resolved by punishment, and without rehabilitation and assistance, they are likely to revert to their previous behavior when they are released into society. The main reason is that punishment, especially imprisonment, does not always eliminate the causes of criminal behavior. When criminals are punished, their behavior is to be deterred from committing new crimes, but many prisons do not provide the criminals with sufficient support and rehabilitation when they are released, which increases the possibility of re-offending. Another reason is the lack of effective rehabilitation in the criminal justice system. Often criminals have a difficult time re-entering society, finding work and housing and making new social contacts, which is not a conducive environment for rehabilitation. Moreover, the society has an important role in the recidivism cycle. A more effective approach to crime and punishment can help to break the recidivism cycle and create a safer and more just society. In conclusion, the reasons why criminals commit new crimes after being punished are complex and based on the individual, social and systemic factors. It is necessary to address the causes of criminal behavior, to provide effective rehabilitation and to support the criminals when they re-enter society.
1400;With all the problems in the world today, spending money on space exploration is a complete waste. The money could be better spent on other causes.;, every day, every year, celebrates its achievements in space exploration. However, it is now the time to question how meaningful these blasts are.First, until all urgent and important matters of the globe have been solved, money on space exploration is meaningless. It at all to invest millions of dollars researching and producing foods for astronauts (for space exploration purpose), while every day thousands of people are starving. Furthermore, the discovery of outer space only serves a minor group of people if the majority well-educated. do no even know how to prevent common threatening diseases such as AIDS and lung cancer.Then, some may argue that the purpose of space exploration to discover new lands, new energy resources or to deter potential threat to . Nevertheless, is it effective to do so while other alternatives are available? yet effectively used. New energy resources (e.g. solar and nuclear energy) have not yet been widely-used. Threats of plagues have not yet been deterred. All of these tasks that haven’t been tackled yet require money. That is why costly space discovery programs are a waste of resources.In a nutshell, people should only invest in space exploration provided that urgent and important matters mentioned earlier in this essay have been solved. Also, purposes of space exploration campaigns should be studied carefully and other alternatives should be considered before the money is wasted.; It is easy to understand that the benefits of space exploration outweigh the costs. But with the many problems we face, hunger, disease, poverty and unemployment, people can hardly imagine that there is any point to spending money on space exploration. First of all, space exploration has led to many new products that have made our lives easier, such as memory foam, water purifiers and the global positioning system. These products have not only improved the quality of life, but also create a lot of work. And there are many long-term benefits to mankind. As our planet faces many problems, such as overpopulation and the exhaustion of natural resources, space exploration can be a potential solution. So although there are many problems on earth, space exploration is worth investing in. Space exploration can also promote international co-operation and the peaceful development of mankind. It is important for mankind to keep investing in space exploration to promote the development of technology and to find a solution to the world's problems. Rather than seeing space exploration as a waste of money, we should regard it as a source of innovation, progress and progress.
1312;With the increase in computer use, many people feel that schools do not need to put the emphasis that they used to on basic handwriting skills or mental mathematics skills.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;In recent years, computer use around the world has increased drastically. As a result technological equipment is used increasingly in schools around the world. Many people question therefore whether schools should put much emphasis on teaching students basic handwriting skills and mental mathematics skills.The use of technological equipment in lessons has increased since the onset of the digital age. Nearly all professions around the world involve computer use and even the simplest tasks are carried out via electronic equipment. Hence, it is important for students to learn how to use technology correctly for their future careers. Electronic devices also offer various learning advantages, as notes and assignments can be completed much faster and more neatly using these tools.Nonetheless, the practical skills such as using and holding a pen correctly are likewise vital for future careers. For that reason, students have to be taught at early ages how to carry out simple tasks using basic skills, such as writing. It is also essential that a student develops neat handwriting, as in the case of a technological problem the student will have to write by hand. Furthermore, final exams are typically written by hand and thus the student must develop the basic skill of holding a pen and writing with it. Mathematics skills are no different. People will not always have a device with them to carry out calculations and the ability to do arithmetic in the head is a vital skill for operating in today’s world.In conclusion, I personally believe that schools should keep a balance between using practical skills and using electronic equipment to carry out certain tasks by having student submit assignments created electronically, yet also by having them complete assignments by hand in class and without computers or calculators. This balance is important, as if the focus lies only on one of the two aspects, the student will face problems later on in life.; A debate has arisen among some people that handwriting and mental arithmetic skills are no longer necessary in schools. I partly disagree with this idea, and I think handwriting and mental arithmetic skills can be useful in a world of the digital age. Students who take notes by hand do better on tests than students who take notes on their computers. Firstly, handwriting is an important skill for children, because it develops their thinking skills. Research has shown that handwriting increases memory, language skills and creativity. Furthermore, handwriting is a unique form of self-expression, and it can be a therapeutic way to express oneself, and it can also improve emotional intelligence. In addition, mental arithmetic skills are also necessary for everyday life, despite the widespread use of calculators and computers. Because handwriting uses the brain more, it helps retain and understand the material. Furthermore, mental arithmetic develops the ability to solve problems logically and logically, which are useful in many professions. For example, when shopping, people need to be able to quickly add up the cost of items, including taxes and sales, in order to make appropriate purchasing decisions. Consequently, schools must continue to emphasize these skills, so that they can form the basis of students' education and that the next generation will be able to be balanced, skilled and able to live in a fast-changing world. To conclude, although the development of the Internet has changed our life and work, handwriting and mental arithmetic are still important for developing thinking skills, self-expression and practicality.
1303;With the scale of globalisation today, it would be of unquestioned benefit to have a single world currency.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Globalisation has become a significant aspect of the world’s modern economy, with countless industries and businesses expanding in various countries. This has led to the debate of developing a world currency with many people believing it could drastically help further develop economies and assist in the development of many countries.A worldwide currency could bring on effects similar to when Euro was developed for Europe. Trade could be significantly encouraged, as there would be no exchange rate fluctuation risks between different currencies. Moreover, tourists would not need to exchange money when travelling.However, there are certain risks to a global currency, which definitely do not make it an “unquestioned benefit”. Countries in debt would not be able to lower their currency value to make consumer goods more desirable, which could develop into a severe economic issue. For example, the US regulated its interest rates to increase the money resources in order to diminish the effect of a recent recession. Also economic problems, such as in Greece, have actually been made worse by the use of the common Euro. If applied worldwide, many countries’ economies could be very similarly negatively impacted. Finally, many countries around the world do not have a stable enough economy to be able to enter a common currency. If weaker countries were to adopt a world currency, this could be disastrous to their economy and to the economies of other countries using the same currency.In conclusion, the extent to which a global currency would be beneficial is quite low. It seems to me that the risks outweigh the benefits, as if a country were to lose economic stability, the world would be impacted as well. For that reason, I feel that in present circumstances, it is best to have separate currencies to protect countries from economic recession.; On the one hand, a single world currency would simplify the operations of international transactions, eliminate the risks of foreign exchange and reduce transaction costs. It seems convenient and effective for international trade and business, but I am a little reluctant to say that it is of unquestionable benefit. On the one hand, the introduction of the European Union's common currency has promoted the economic integration of the countries in the region and the exchange of goods and services. A single world currency can achieve the same result in a broader scale, which may lead to a certain degree of prosperity in international trade and development. In the European Union, for example, the central bank's monetary policy has been criticized for focusing too much on the interests of big countries such as Germany and neglecting the interests of small countries such as Greece. On the other hand, a single world currency means a loss of monetary sovereignty for individual countries. National governments will lose the power to establish their own monetary policies and will lose the power to respond to national economic conditions. Such a system will inevitably lead to political and economic tensions, and the complexity of the implementation of such a system cannot be ignored. A single world currency would make these problems more serious on a global scale. Consequently, I believe that the benefits of a single world currency are not unquestionable, and that it is necessary to establish a more subtle and detailed international monetary policy. In short, although there are some advantages to establishing a single world currency, I believe it is necessary to consider the potential disadvantages and difficulties of establishing a single world currency before it can be implemented.
1295;With the vast increase in online resources today, libraries with print books are not a necessity for today’s society.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is indeed true that digital resources today far outstrip what can be put and stored in print books. Almost any kind of book can now be accessed digitally and those that can’t be will soon be changed to a digital format. Some people, therefore, believe that libraries with print books are no longer needed.If one looks at this issue dispassionately, it seems far more logical that people now should only read books digitally. It only requires a single computer or electronic reader and an individual can have access to the history of literature and works on all other fields. The costs involved with setting, typing, printing and distributing print books would practically disappear and this would make things more convenient and much cheaper. An actual library building would be totally unnecessary, as all one would need would be a ‘virtual library’ as a website and all works could be accessed through this portal. There would not even be any need to leave the house to gain access to anything one needed. This would seem to be the most logical way of proceeding.Logic, however, is not always the best approach to everything. Print books have a long history with humanity and our relationship with real books is not something that can be changed overnight. Many people, including younger readers, feel that there is something special about having a book with real paper and needing to turn pages. There will therefore for the time being be a future for print books and libraries.Libraries will continue to be especially important, as not all older people use computers and e-readers as much as the younger generation. They will still want to read print books and the library is a cheap and convenient place to find them. In addition, if only a few books in print are available in the future, libraries might be one of the few places where they might be accessed. Another purpose that libraries serve is acting as community centres that organise events, education and childcare. Ironically, libraries also provide computers and Internet access for people who cannot afford their own.In spite of the seeming dominance to come of digital books, I feel that there is and will be a place for libraries with print books. This state of affairs might change in the future, but at present, they are important community resources.; Firstly, libraries provide a special learning environment which encourages people of all ages to read and learn. While it is true that the Internet has made many things available on the web, print books and libraries still have a significant role to play. In addition, libraries offer a calm, quiet place for people to study and concentrate which is usually missing in many homes or in the digital environment. Secondly, not all the information is available on the Internet and, even if it is, not all of it is reliable. Holding a book in your hands and looking through the pages and discovering the authors and the topics is still a unique experience. Thirdly, libraries have a very important role in education and community development. Many printed works, especially classics, historical documents and scientific journals, are only available in print format and are therefore an essential source for many academics and scientists. In addition, many libraries offer education for children, language courses for newcomers and job training for the unemployed. In conclusion, while the Internet has certainly increased the availability of information, print books and libraries still play an important role in today's society. I therefore believe that libraries will continue to be a necessity for the future, complementing the availability of the Internet and providing a useful service for the community. They provide a unique learning environment, reliable information and promote education and community.
1392;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Capital punishment is always associated with ignorance and intolerance. In fact, we must acknowledge that some people disagree with this kind of penalty, but others vote in its favor. Portugal was the first European country to end this kind of penalty. Since the 19th century, tolerance and respect for life important values. Moreover, we can affirm that remains under the same codes. Maybe because of a religious view point, the respect for life is a typical value in the Old Catholic world.Those who are in favor of capital punishment mostly live in developing countries. However, this is not just an image of the Third World countries. Actually, the USA is one country where this kind of punishment has its rates of application. The state of Texas, in particular, is at the top, supporting this measure against crime, especially those involving serial killers and crimes against children. In a society dominated by fear and government control, it is foreseen that this penalty will continue .Maybe this is not a simple question. As we can see there are several values here and of course cultural behavior. The roots of the question are religious, cultural, ethical and even geographical. The world is divided and the law systems show this division. The solutions, however can lead us to other questions concerning revenge and justice. better to kill a person because of his crimes? Can we admit that a life sentence could be a much better sentence? In fact, rehabilitation is the right way especially with an accurate psychological evaluation first. Some people are lost forever, and in my opinion some murderers and other criminals will suffer more in jail. In this sense, capital punishment is an easy way out.; In my opinion, I disagree with the statement that our lives are less safe and the number of violent crimes is on the rise if there is no capital punishment. There have been discussions for centuries about the importance of capital punishment to control violence in society. Some people say that the death penalty is a necessary condition for law and order. Others argue that it does not really have an effect on the reduction of violent crimes. Many countries where capital punishment has been abolished have experienced a decline in violent crimes. In Canada, for example, where the death penalty was abolished in 1976, the number of murders has decreased steadily. Firstly, there is no proven evidence that capital punishment reduces violent crime. There is also a risk that innocent people are executed, as erroneous judgements can result in a wrong conviction. Secondly, capital punishment is often seen as cruel and inhumane punishment that violates human rights. Other factors such as social and economic conditions, education and the administration of justice have a greater influence on violence than the death penalty. To conclude, I believe that the effectiveness of capital punishment to control violence in society is overestimated. By killing a human being, the state is, in a way, committing the same violence it wants to prevent. The authorities should rather focus on removing the roots of violent crime, such as poverty, unemployment and lack of education. In this way, a society can be made safer and more secure without having to resort to the death penalty.
1430;Without capital punishment our lives are less secure and crimes or violence increase. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Serious crimes need capital punishment so that the are unable to get involved in the crime in the future. However, they want to stop the acts of violation in the future then it would be better to .Overall, I agree with the fact that punishment is the way to avoid the and hence our lives become more secure. If the wrongdoer wants to be a good and there is a particular financial or personal problem that led him to the wrong way, then it would be the nice option to forgive him and try to solve the problem he . Although by this way, some bad may become effective of the society but some do not bring themselves to the right path because they are . The person that involved in the crime and never to stop the law-breaking act should be punished in extremely serious way. However, it totally depends on the nature of crime. Some to a capital punishment and some may require a small penalty. The law-making institutions are responsible to bring the bad man to the right level of punishment that he deserves. If there is weak legislation to properly handle the offender, it may for the good . The government should be the responsible authority to provide a secure and better state to live. Laws should be implemented and executed in the most proper way that not allow the offender to commit violent acts or to break the law in any way and to any extent. To sum up, it is the responsibility of the state to stop people involved in crime. It may be done through solving the problems of the people that led them to commit that act or by the punishment accordingly.Where are the paragraphs? This is a good essay; however there are many small mistakes that might cost you dearly. There are also several unclear expressions and grammatical errors."; In my opinion, I partially disagree with this opinion. This opinion that our lives are less secure and crimes or violence increase without capital punishment is a controversial and controversial issue that has caused many discussions. Some say that capital punishment is a deterrent against crime, while others say that it is not a deterrent against crime. In my opinion, I believe that the existence of the death penalty can cause fear among the potential perpetrators of crime, which may result in a decrease in the number of violent crimes. On the other hand, if the capital punishment is executed, the dangerous people in the world are eliminated from the world, which is also conducive to the security of society. However, it is easy for the judicial system to make mistakes and a mistake in a verdict and sentence, and there is a possibility of erroneous execution, which is an injustice of the judicial system and violates the rights of the victims. In addition, it has been proved by many studies that the implementation of capital punishment does not necessarily lead to a decrease in the number of crimes. In fact, in some countries where capital punishment has been abolished, the number of crimes has decreased, which shows that other factors such as education, social conditions and judicial conditions are more important in determining the crime rate. I therefore disagree to a large extent with this opinion that the death penalty is the main determinant of the security of our lives and the number of crimes. The reduction of violent crimes and the prevention of violent crimes requires the implementation of a comprehensive policy that reduces poverty, lack of education, and discrimination, etc., in society.
163;Write about the following topic.Although there are a lot of translation software available, learning a language could still be advantageous. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people claim that language knowledge has still benefited inspite of appearance of applications and websites providing translation in real time. Modern special software is able to give quite quality translation into different languages, and it seems that it will soon replace the translators and will get rid of necessity to learn new languages. However, in my opinion, there are still some essential advantages to know foreign languages.First of all, any language is so complicated and constantly changing system that it is impossible to automized translation process to keep all senses. For instance, if you interlocutor creates a joke based on words game, it will unlikely recognise by AI. Thus, it is too hard to teach a computer to uderstand all meanings that you want to provide.Another important aspect of learning languages is knowing new cultures. Language is the great source for understanding other nations and countries. If you use online translator, you will never know the origine of some idioms or phrases that contain culture code.Moreover, learning new language is a tool of training your brain. It helps to develop memory and imagination. For instance, people didn't refuse studying maths after calculation device had been invented, because it is still important to understand how it works and it is necessary for developing other sciences.Finally, there is a lot of places and occasions when you do not have internet access. Then online translators are not available. But if you need help or ask a path being abroad, it is better to know at least some phrases. Otherwise, you can occur in unpleasant situation.To sum up, I definitely agree the statement that learning languages is essential in spite of techology progress. Although artificial intelligence is able to translate everything you want, it is crucial to continue learning languages in order to understand all sense and meanings in conversation with foreigners, to know new cultures and understand their peculiarities and, of course, to make your brain work.; I strongly agree with the statement because learning a language has many advantages, which are more than just translation. Although translation software has made communication between different languages easier, I still think it is advantageous to learn a language. One reason is that when we communicate with native speakers, it is important to understand their idioms, idioms, and phrases. This is especially important for business and diplomacy where the meaning of the sentence is very important. Learning a language also increases the perspective and worldview, and it is also a good thing to learn more empathy and tolerance for others. Another reason is that language acquisition increases intelligence, especially memory and problem-solving skills, and studies have shown that bilinguals have improved executive functions and delayed onset of age-related decline. In addition, although translation software has a certain use, learning a language brings many advantages, from intelligence improvement to cultural understanding and better career opportunities. Another reason is that although translation software makes it easier to communicate, it is often difficult to understand technical, literary and poetic texts, which requires a deep understanding of language and culture. I think that as technology continues to develop, it will be increasingly important for those who want to engage in the world.

Why are more people choosing to have operation to change the way they look? Do you think this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;A greater number of individuals opted for plastic surgery to enhance the physical outlook. What could be the reason behind the increasing number of people opting for cosmetic surgery to deter their appearance.In my opinion the main reason why cosmetic surgery is in demand nowadays is because society has set a certain standard that physical appearance will be the fastest ticket to stand out in the crowd. Second is it boosts confidence to people with low self esteem.The favorable outcome is not as much the adverse effect to the individuals. Example, the fastest way to reduce wrinkles on the face is to get Botox treatment. It lasts 3-4 months, after that it needs continuous medication to maintain what has been changed. It takes a lot of money to satisfy the demands of the society. On top of that repetition of pain and recovery during and after the surgery.There are numerous natural ways to enhance beauty and confidence. Contentment, exercise and a healthy lifestyle are effective methods to maintain the genuine beauty of the people. Simple walking in the morning, keeping the distance from negativity and eating vegetables and fruits are the simplest methods that boost the natural glow of the body and prevent us from being sick.To conclude the essay, I think plastic surgery is not necessary to enhance physical outlook as it uses synthetic components that have harmful effects within the body.; You may say that it is a positive or a negative development. I think it is a negative development because people, especially young people, are influenced by social media to follow these images of beauty. Many people believe that if you change the way you look, it will also improve their self-esteem and the quality of their lives. Another reason is the development of medicine that makes the surgery safe and more available. However, I think that the increasing popularity of cosmetic surgery is a negative development. Some people have cosmetic surgery to improve physical defects that have a negative impact on their mental health, such as facial deformities or scars. The risks and long-term psychological effects of cosmetic surgery are also unclear. The media beauty ideals are often unhealthy and unattainable, which leads to a culture of dissatisfaction with one's natural appearance. This is partly due to the high social pressure to achieve a certain appearance, which makes it more difficult for people to be satisfied with themselves. Finally, the increasing number of people who are having cosmetic surgery is a negative development that reflects the pressure and the inaccessibility of the beauty ideals of the time.

What solutions can you suggest?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Most children are facing one form of bullying or the other in our schools on daily basis world wide. It is becoming a serious problem and there is a need to solve this. In this essay, we would be considering two causes and possible ways to solve these.First of all, the rate at which children bullying each other in the school environment is rising. One major cause is that bullying breeds bullying, children who are faced with physical, mental and emotional abuse from homes tend to transfer their fustrations on their peers. They think that is how one is supposed to live, exacting authority to gain superiority on weaker peers in school. Another is children who has low self esteem, such students feels threatened over their classmates they taught to be more intelligent or having better physical appearance than them.Although, there are several causes of bullying, teachers should be taught how to identify children who are from abusive homes and inform the appropriate authority. These students would taken away from such toxic environment early and they would be sent for some pschological therapy. Meanwhile, education is also a key factor especially for children who have low self esteem. This should be done by forms such as role plays, presentation and drama, where these students are taught how to have self love and accepting what they can not change on their self.In conclusion, children from abusive homes and those who have low self esteem are some of the reasons for bullying. I recommend that early identification of abusive children and education is some of the ways we can solve these problems.; Bullying has many causes and there is no single solution to this problem. The most obvious cause of bullying is the desire for power, which some students seek to obtain by intimidating or threatening their peers. In addition, social expectations and the value system that students follow play an important role in the development of bullying. For example, in a school where competition and aggression are valued very highly, students may feel obliged to establish their dominance over others. The development of social media has also had a profound effect, because it has made it possible for bullying to occur anonymously and often with an international dimension, which can make it difficult for victims to escape. In order to counteract bullying, schools should first of all have strict anti-bullying policies and enforce them strictly. If there is no proper supervision and no reaction from the school authorities, the bullies can take advantage of this and they will believe they can act without consequence. If students, parents and teachers have open and honest communication about bullying incidents, it will be easier for the victims to report what has happened without being afraid of repercussions. Schools should also provide teachers and other school staff with the knowledge and skills to intervene in bullying situations effectively. By addressing the causes of bullying and introducing these measures, schools can create a safer and more supportive environment for all students. I have also seen a great deal of positive development in schools where peer support and counselling are offered to students.

In this era of e-commerce, the convenience and availability of buying things on the Internet have become very popular, and the convenience and availability of buying things on the Internet have become a very popular choice. A major advantage of shopping on the Internet is the convenience it provides. Within a few clicks, consumers can browse and buy products from the comfort of their homes and do it at any time of day, which is especially convenient for people with busy schedules or who live in remote areas with limited shopping opportunities. Another advantage is that there are more choices than in physical stores. For example, Amazon.com offers a wide variety of books, including rare and hard-to-find books. Besides, the Internet can help consumers compare prices and products on different sites, so they can find the best deals. Despite the fact that some people may argue that there is no ""personal"" touch or immediate contact in buying things on the Internet, many online retailers have an efficient customer service system to answer consumers' questions. In addition, the need to travel to the store to buy things can be eliminated, which saves time, money and energy. To conclude, the convenience, availability and variety of products available on the Internet outweigh the disadvantages, and with the improvement of the Internet and the service of the site, it will become an increasingly dominant trend in the future of the retail industry. From my personal experience, the process of buying things on the Internet has been smooth and efficient, and many online retailers offer reliable delivery and reasonable prices."
515;Write about the following topic.Cohabitation is believed to bring huge advantages for young people since it enables them to fully understand each other before deciding to get married.Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many people believe it may be advisable for couples to live together before getting married, as it may lead to a smoother relationship after they have married.I tend to agree with such opinions, as I find the arguments that usually support them to be quite reasonable. For example, it is commonly said that people act differently when they are at home and when they are outside. People instinctively tend to be more relaxed and off-guard when at home, whereas in social situations they usually make an effort, even if unconsciously, to be more likable and to conceal the less agreeable aspects of their personality from others, even their partners. Because of this, it is usual to hear that one does not truly know someone until one has lived with that person.In extreme cases, cohabitation before marriage could even prevent couples from entering into a marriage that is bound to fail and will lead to unhappiness. Considering this possibility seems reasonable, as marriage is not only an emotional bond, but also a legal one, and undoing it is usually upsetting, time-consuming and costly.Another reason I find cohabitation before marriage to be a sensible choice is that, as minor disagreements and conflicts are usually inevitable during the first months of cohabitation, it is preferable to pass through that stage before getting married than to add such problems to a period which in itself can already be stressful, such as the few weeks before the ceremony and the weeks following.What I have said up to this point reflects my opinion, but it must be noted I did not put any of it into practice when I got married. Indeed, my wife and I decided to move in together only a few weeks before the ceremony. This decision was due to the fact that her family is quite old-fashioned, and moving in together before would undoubtedly have caused them pain, even if we had our reasons for doing so and they would have understood them. No degree of persuasion would have avoided or removed such pain. We found the long-term benefits of a stable and close relationship with her family to be more important than the discomfort of not moving in together, and we ultimately decided to do it only once the ceremony was planned.; I agree strongly with this opinion because living together before marriage helps couples to get to know each other better. Recent research has confirmed the idea that living together is beneficial for young couples. They have to learn how to manage their money, how to share the housework, how to resolve the conflict in a realistic and intimate environment. One of the main advantages of living together is that young people can test their relationship in a real environment. Moreover, young people develop their skills in communication, compromise and conflict resolution. In addition, they develop their emotional maturity and independence. For example, my friend, who lived with her boyfriend before marriage, told me that she developed an awareness of the importance of communication and teamwork in relationships. These skills are important for a healthy and happy marriage, and the intimacy of cohabitation is a good opportunity for young people to develop them in a supportive and loving environment. In conclusion, I would like to say that cohabitation is the best preparation for marriage, because it allows young people to test their relationship, develop emotional maturity and learn skills that are important for marriage.

What measures can be taken to protect them?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;These days, consumers often suffer from the increase of numbers of advertisements conducted by competing companies. I believe that this fact has certain negative effects on consumers' working performance as well as their private space and time. In order to protect consumers, some proposals related to protecting their information and eliminating the number of advertisements are required.The increasing number of advertisements has a negative effect on the consumers. Firstly, their working perfomance can be reduced. Obivously, when a person is working, he cannot receive a large number of advertisements, process and response them. I know a researcher who receives a lot of advertising emails from certain banksand even some scientific journal while he require time to perform many research projects. This makes him feel uncomfortable when working, thereby reducing the research's quality. Secondly, the advertisements can affect on people private space and time. For examle, when they spend time on their family after a hard working day, or even when they are sleeping. This completyly affects on the consumers, in terms of both physical and mental health.For protecting consumers, certain methods need to be proposed. Firstly, it can be implied that the consumers' information is illegal used by many companies. Therefore, an imporvement of security method can allow us to protect consumers. Secondly, eliminating the number of advertisements performed by companies and eliminating the hours for companies send advertisements are required.In conclusion, the increasing numbers of advertisements leads to certain unwanted results for consumers, such as reducing their working performance as well as their private space and time. For protecting consumers, we need to protect their personal information and eliminate the number of advertisements.; In my opinion, consumers are greatly influenced by advertisements. Adverts can change people's thinking, influence their purchasing power and even create new needs. Moreover, it is possible to influence consumers with subliminal messages and the celebrity image. Despite these benefits, some consumers may be confused by misleading and inaccurate advertisements and may make bad decisions. Also, consumers can be taught to think critically and to avoid emotional appeals and the 'bandwagon' effect. Moreover, governments should monitor advertisements and if necessary tighten advertising laws. Such measures will protect consumers from misleading advertisements and help them to make their own decisions, which reflect their needs and personal tastes. Public awareness campaigns and media education programmes are also needed to protect consumers from misleading advertisements. Because consumers will be more aware of the influence of advertisements on them, companies will have to adopt more responsible and transparent advertising practices.

Some people think that the closure of local business will bring about the death of local communities.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;As the huge company extends their bussiness, the local markets is dimmished to local society. This essay explains why I disagree closure of local business will bring about the death of local communities with relevant examples.First, Big company drag the new residents. I believe major company make the local communities to flourish. My cusion lived in countryside for 30 years. Every time when I visited that place, that farm land still same during the a few decades. However, recently when I dropped by there I surprised with new tall building that newly built. My cusion told me once the big supermarkert open in this neighborhood, grasp many couples or familly to live here. Eventually, that rural place's population is surged.Someone thought giant grocery's product cheap price can not compete with local product, that make local place to close. I considered it is anachromism idea. Now the customer's purchasing value is totally diffrent with previous eras. Buyer start choose organic product and eco-friendlly or morality brand. If local stores have their own unique products, which are not replace with other, such as handmade cheese and unique taste of bread, local bussiness can compete with global chain markets.In conclusion, albeit famous company expands their sites every moments, the local community can be larger by new residents settled down near local region. Also, local bussiness have specialty, community can not dismissed; I think small local business are the foundation of local culture and character. The development of the superstore in many countries is a growing concern for local business and the death of the local community. In many cities, the arrival of a superstore has caused family-run bakeries, butchers and fruit and vegetable stores to close, resulting in a loss of diversity and beauty. Profits tend to be reinvested locally rather than sent abroad, and the high-efficiency superstores monopolize low-price advantages, and there is a certain homogenization of the local identity. For example, the closure of a local bookstore in my hometown caused a sharp decline in pedestrian traffic and a certain emptiness in the city center. Local business owners usually care about the well-being of the local community, and they are often willing to participate in local affairs. I believe that the loss of small local business can cause a loss of local identity and social cohesion, and that they should be supported and maintained. However, some superstores also try to help local suppliers and get involved locally, which may reduce some of the negative effects.

Anyway, a lot of people think that this types of sports are very dangerous and should be banned. This essay will talk about extreme sports giving my own opinion about the idea of banning this activities because of their risks.Practicing a sport is very important for the general health of a person; a lot of people choose to practice dangerous sports, like skiing, because of the adrenaline and the sensation that it brings to you. Sports of this type can help you to go over your fear and they will help you to see life from a different perspective.Anyway, the risks that an athlete will go through are many; every year the amount of people that have injuries or, sometimes die, because of this types of activities are numerous. Especially with skiing, a person should never go alone in places that don't have the right equipment to guarantee a safe experience; many times when practicing this types of sports, athletes from all over the world decide to go over their limit going to practice in zones that are known to be dangerous or unsafe and, in this cases, the possibility of something bad to happen is high.Personally, I think that when you want to practice or experiment a sport that is extreme you should take all the right prevention to make the experience as safe as possible to avoid any injuries. Practicing sports is important but it is also fundamental to try your best to avoid injuries when practicing it. This essay talked about extreme sports and their risk, giving my own opinion at the end."; I strongly disagree that extreme sports such as skydiving and skiing should be banned because of the dangers they bring. Although these sports are risky, most participants take precautions and follow the rules of safety to reduce the risk of accidents. Besides, extreme sports provide an adventurous experience that many people seek. These sports not only strengthen the body but also increase mental strength, help participants overcome the difficulties of life, and give a sense of pride. Skydiving, for example, allows people to feel the thrill of falling from great heights, and skiing allows people to go down steep slopes with the beautiful view of nature. Banning these sports would violate the rights of people to choose what to do for their leisure time. For example, skydiving requires that jumpers undergo thorough training and check their equipment before each jump. Ski resorts have well-marked trails, safety teams and emergency procedures. There are many people who participate in these sports with a good understanding of the risks. Instead of banning these sports, we should work with these sports to raise safety awareness and improve safety practices. People who are attracted to these sports should be able to enjoy them without being banned.
479;Write about the following topic.Few people devote time to hobbies nowadays. Say why you think this is the case and what effect this has on the individual and society in general.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Hobbies are recreational activities that are pursued away from one's school or work. They are meant to be an escape from the mundane and a way of keeping people sane and happy. Unfortunately, they have become almost a luxury in today's fast-paced world.Several reasons can account for this massive decrease in the pursuit of hobbies. One such reason is the fact that hobbies require time and money which are two very dear resources in today's world. Social sophistication and technological advancements have brought about changes in hobbies. What used to be called hobbies in the past are now considered obsolete and the new ones, including video games and virtual reality require financial commitment in their pursuit. Even if one has the money to pursue such, he or she would have to set aside time in his or her busy schedule to enjoy those hobbies. It is therefore no wonder that most people found to pursue hobbies today are either wealthy youth or comfortable pensioners.Secondly, lack of interest may be an important factor why people devote little to no time to hobbies. Most of the educated lot are taught from a tender age only to concentrate on their studies in order to secure a comfortable future for themselves. Such children are discouraged from enjoying anything away from anything extracurricular and therefore grow into hobby-less adults who work all day and do nothing else otherwise. This is seen in a lot of Ghanaian homes where doing anything other than studying after school is deemed a taboo. Consequently, many grow into adults with little humour or mirth.Moreover, many people get exhausted with school or work, which have become extremely intensive nowadays, as compared to the more laid back past. After a tiring day, most people like to crawl into their beds to catch a night-long rest only to return to their busy life the next day.This lack of hobby pursuit, though understandable, does the individual and society more harm than good. Many individuals today are being treated for one mental health or another. Hobbies are a good way to relax and destress through leisure and can go a long way to improve mental health. Its absence will only wreak havoc for the society, which will only consist of tired and apathetic individuals who could not care less about each other and their surroundings.In conclusion, it is important, albeit difficult, to pay attention to hobbies in order to improve the health and psyche of the individual and society as a whole. More effort should be geared at encouraging hobbies at school and at the work place.; In my opinion, the fact that people devote little time to hobbies nowadays can be explained by the intensity of modern life, which does not leave enough time or energy for leisure. I think this is because of the very demanding situation of the working world and the family, which in my opinion, limits the time and energy available for leisure activities. Also, people are missing the benefits of hobbies, such as stress relief, creativity and socialization. And in this way, it is easy for people to become unhappy and unsatisfied and to experience a negative effect on their mental and physical health. Thus, the lack of hobbies also affects society in a negative way, as they bring people together and make people communicate. In addition, the lack of hobbies can lead to a decrease in creativity and innovation in people who do not have hobbies that keep them alert and inspire new ideas. I know many people who, for example, used to play music and paint in their free time, but who now have no time for this because of their work. And a decline in hobbies also means that cultural and social knowledge is lost as fewer people are interested in activities that preserve and transfer cultural knowledge. In short, the decline in hobbies is a worrying development that affects both the individual and society. People should put their own interests first and allocate time for hobbies, so as to maintain a healthy work-life balance and contribute to the social and cultural life of the community.

Personally, I think there are some good advantages team activities cause our life,and especially in business scenes more comfortable and productive.Initially, only one person's work is limited, compared with group activities. This means that working only one person will be able to cause some profits to some extent. On the other hand, group working will be more productive and efficient to make more sales figures. In addition, each person has a great ability. For example, some people have great communication skills and negotiations. Those people arethe most appropriate roles for sales. Furthermore, some people are good at analysing the group performance quality and making strategies. Those who are good at these activities are best for marketing team. As a result, they can focus on their strong points for work and they can divide and conquer the tasks with each other.Of course, some people are eager to work alone at their own relaxed pace and make a profit to some extent. This is less stressful they do not need to keep attention from other colleagues. But this means that they need to decide all tasks and take all responsibility. Sometimes it might be risky once they made a mistake and caused a huge deficit.Finally, there is no doubt that more than two heads are better than one. People can share their experiences and opinion to improve their group activities. If some people who are sensitive and feel pressure if some people meddle in too much. It is necessary to organize some rules that must be effective. For example, all people need to try to stay positive, avoid stating negative or swear words, and not deny one person's opinion straightforwardly and emotionally. Making a great atmosphere, saying positive words with each other, and including some humor, will lead to everyone's performance being more productive.; I strongly agree that group or team activities can teach us more skills for life than those which are done alone. By taking part in group or team activities, I have acquired skills that are useful in both my personal and professional life. The most important of these skills is communication. In a recent team project at university, we had to write a marketing plan together. This project required me to be part of a group and to share my ideas, to express my opinions, and to listen to others. In such circumstances, everyone in the group has to effectively express their own ideas, share their own opinions, and listen to others’ ideas. In this way, they have to communicate, cooperate and resolve conflicts, which are all very useful life skills. The second important skill that group or team activities develop is problem-solving and adaptability. We had to present our ideas, negotiate, and compromise to achieve a common goal. In a group or team sport, for example, we have to adapt to the changing conditions of the weather and unexpected actions of the opponent. Working in a team with other people makes us more creative in our problem-solving, and it teaches us to be flexible. In addition, group or team activities develop leadership, time management and accountability. The team members have to take responsibility for their work, manage their time effectively, and lead when necessary. Adaptability is a very useful skill for life, especially when there are many uncertainties and challenges in my personal and professional life. In conclusion, I strongly believe that group or team activities develop important life skills such as communication, problem-solving, and leadership, which are very useful in both professional and personal relationships.
317;Write about the following topic.In many countries large amounts of foods are wasted. Why do you think people waste food in this way? What can be done to reduce the amount of food thrown away?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, many countries are confronted with the increasing amount of waste and one of the major contributions is food wasted by people. This issue is mainly driven by an over-ordered food and misunderstanding about the method of food disposal. However, people could cease from creating food waste through the act of both restaurants and governments.To begin with, it is obvious that countries have wasted because the amount of food that people buy is more than the amount they need. The crucial factor of this behavior is that when people contemplate menus in a restaurant, they tend to order many items in order to satisfy their desire level. Eventually, a lot of food scraps are left when these people finish eating their meals. Another potential cause could be because people do not know how to deal with food scraps. As a result, they might understand that putting wasted food into a garbage is the only solution they could do. This is exemplified by statistics published by Thai waste association which demonstrate that more than a half of waste in Thailand come from household food.A possible solution for this matter could be for restaurants to fine their customers who leave some food. This policy possibly encourages customers to carefully think of the reasonable amount of food when they order. In addition, from the country’s level governments could also educate their citizens including companies in the food-service industry about how to do with food waste due to the fact that some edible items could be food for animals. For instance, authorities could give an instruction demonstrating that dogs can be fed with remaining food such as rice or bread while remaining vegetables can be food for rabbits.In conclusion, people waste food since they order food by what they want without considering the amount and most of them misunderstand about the way to dispose of food waste. Nevertheless, this concern can be coped with the penalty by restaurants as well as the guidance from governments regarding feeding animal with food scraps.; In my opinion, the main reason for the waste of food is the lack of planning and the lack of time to cook and go shopping. People often buy more than they need because of the good offers in the stores, without considering the expiration dates. Also, many people who buy food do not have the time to cook it, so they buy something and then eat it as soon as it spoils. People who want to reduce the amount of food they throw away can do several things. First of all, they should prepare a shopping list for every meal and stick to it when shopping. In addition, governments and companies can do something to reduce food waste. Secondly, leftovers and creative use of leftovers can reduce food waste. For example, leftover vegetables can be used to make a tasty soup or a sauce. Thirdly, some countries have developed applications that allow people to buy food from restaurants and cafes that are being thrown away at a reduced price, thus reducing food waste and supporting local businesses. In addition, governments and companies can support food banks and charities to distribute surplus food to needy people. These measures will reduce food waste significantly and will help to create a more sustainable and responsible food culture.
1025;Write about the following topic.In many countries, a small number of people earn extremely high salaries. Some people believe that this is good for the country, but others think that governments should not allow salaries above a certain level.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In many parts of the world, few people get a lot of money thanks to their job. It is believed by some that this is an advantage for the country, while it is thought by others that governments should put a limit above which salaries cannot be.In my opinion, I believe that not only people have to be rewarded for their performance, but also their wage salary has to be proportional to the benefits that they are leading to the country.For instance, due to the Covid a lot of people suffered several injuries which were cured only thanks to the doctors and the nurses. For this reason, since they are saving lifes everyday,it seems unbelievable the fact that they are earning much less money than football players.Another example can be found in people involved in the national security: I believe that it would be fairer if these professionals were paid more than an influencer.However, in our society this figures (such as doctors) are paid by governments through taxes, while football players or influncers gain incomes by private companies.In order to not impose an heavier taxation, politics should categorise jobs basing on their importance in the society. Hence, we will have a specific amount that these employers can earn.Thus, if these no-fundamental workers (like actors or actress) are earning more money than the precise level chosen, these will be used as funds to increase life-saving jobs' salary.In conclusion, I believe that highest salaries should exist only if we are referring to a job that is needed by everyone.; In recent years, in many countries, the high salaries earned by a small part of the population have been the subject of intense discussion. Some people argue that the extremely high salaries help the country because they attract talented people and lead to innovation and economic growth. For example, large technology companies like Google and Facebook offer astronomical salaries for talented engineers and scientists, which helps innovation and significantly increases the country's income. In other countries, the difference between the salary of a businessman and the salary of an average employee can reach hundreds of times, which is the basis for the further development of social inequality. However, others believe that governments should limit salaries to reduce income inequality and fairness. They argue that very high salaries can lead to a very unequal distribution of wealth, where a small part of the population gets huge wealth and the rest have a difficult time. If the salary is limited, the brain drain will increase and the country's competitiveness will decrease. However, the government could introduce progressive taxation, where the highest incomes pay a higher percentage, and use the money to improve education and social care. In my opinion, high salaries can lead to innovation and economic growth, but governments should take measures to reduce income inequality. This is necessary for long-term prosperity and unity in the country. .
233;Write about the following topic.In some parts of the world people try to find out one's own family history. Why do people do this? Do you think it is a positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"At present, discovering one`s own family history is becoming more and more commom. In the following paragraphs, I will present the motives why people do that and the reason I strongly believe this is important and have positive effects on people.Probably the most crucial motive people search for their family`s past is to find out about any chronical diseases. One of society`s biggest concern nowadays is healthy leaving. Therefore, by knowing the family health history and genetic predisposition to a specific disease such as cancer or diabetes, one can prepare and take the appropriate mesures to prevent it or have an early treatment.Moreover, another reason people may seek for their ancestors`s history is to build a sense of belonging. Human beings need to feel welcomed and inserted into a culture; a community`s identity is as important as an individual one, as it provides people with the opportunity to grow and develop relantioships. When people know about their family history, their sense of belonging is promoted, and they can actively participate in their culture and contribute to their community.As mentioned in the previous paragraphs, people search about family history for health and cultural reasons. One and the other do impact positivily a person`s life, as being healthy and part of a community integrate people`s satisfaction about living.To summarize, one may try to find out about their family history for two main motives, one being about their health and the other one about feeling part of a community. Both reasons are important and have positive impacts on one`s life."; It is a popular activity in many countries. People do it for several reasons, especially because they want to understand their history, their cultural roots, and their family history. When one is familiar with his family history, one feels that one is closer to his own self, closer to his family. In my opinion, finding out about family history is a positive activity. Not only does it give us a sense of belonging and pride, but also deepens our understanding of other cultures. And there are also practical benefits. For example, knowing about the migrations, struggles, and achievements of one's ancestors gives a unique insight into the social, economic, and historical background that has shaped their lives, and so on. to promote tolerance, to encourage a broad view of the complexity of human experience. For example, people who look for their family history have been able to find long-lost relatives through the use of family history websites and genetic testing. These discoveries can not only make one feel closer to his own family, but also give one a wider social network and support system. In short, finding out one's own family history is a positive activity that brings us many benefits. Family history is not only an honor to the past generations, but also a bond that unites us in a common future.
987;Write about the following topic.Information technology is changing many aspects of our lives and now dominates our home, leisure and work activities.To what extent do the benefits of information technology outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;There is no doubt that these days information technology has invaded our space and dominated our home leisure and work. However, the question: is dominating our lives by this technology have a negative or positive impact on our lives? Is considered one of the most controversial issues today. In this essay, I am going to examine this phenomenon from both viewpoints.On one side of the argument, some people argue that the benefits considerably outweigh the disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is integrating technology in every aspect eases our lives and decreases hardworking. For example, advanced houses with integrated voice commands give the person the ability to achieve multiple tasks without any physical activity. Moreover, the technology allows people to connect multiple devices with an email address and control them remotely. One good illustration of that you can switch on and off your home AC while you are at work by the WIFI technology.On the other hand, it is also possible to consider it with the opposing case. It is often argued that in fact using advanced technology increase the number of unhealthy people. People often have this opinion because people become lazier, and their daily activity dramatically decreases making them prone to diseases.As we have seen, there are no easy answers to this question. On balance, however, I tend to believe that using advanced information technology should be limited to simple tasks, so at any point if a technical error happened you can resume your life without any obstacles.; On the one hand, the benefits of information technology are multifaceted. The disadvantages of this technological revolution are also reflected, but in my opinion the benefits of information technology far outweigh the disadvantages. Information technology has revolutionized communication, making it possible to stay in contact with people worldwide and encouraging international relationships and collaborations. For example, information technology has created an unprecedented access to information, making it easier to learn and study. Thanks to the Internet, you can acquire knowledge about any subject, any time, anywhere. On the other hand, information technology also has its disadvantages, such as privacy issues, cyberbullying and the automation of work, but this disadvantage can be avoided through responsible use and by enforcing strict security and confidentiality standards. In the work environment, it increases efficiency and productivity, enables remote working and eliminates geographical barriers. The emergence of information technology has also created a new era of social progress and has made it possible to facilitate daily life. With responsible use and adequate precautions, information technology can continue to enhance our lives and is an essential tool in today's digital world. For example, strong passwords, prudent use of the Internet and support for legislation that protects personal data, can significantly reduce the risk of information technology. The more we accept the benefits of information technology, the more we can take advantage of its potential to improve our personal, social and professional lives.
1033;Write about the following topic.It is inevitable that traditional cultures will be lost as technology develops. Technology and traditional cultures are incompatible.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many people hold the view that traditional culture and technological development cannot coexist as the latter catch on, the former will be bound to disappear. I totally disagree with this because both can be implemented jointly by putting technology at the service of tradition and through pilot projects.To begin with, technological progress, which is making major strides in our daily lives, is the means by which local mores, custom and traditions could be brought back to life, proving they are compatible. In fact, by tapping technology to make tradition far more attractive, considerably more audience will be engaged into such activities. Bologna is a case in point, since, thanks to digital machines and drones which have supported housewives into the making of , the traditional celebration of “making pasta day ” has recently being turned into a successful events, which draws people from country as far afield as China.Another example of possible coexistence is the possibility to heighten awareness of people costumes through the creation of pilot projects which bring both habits and technology to a new whole level. This can be put into practice by setting a direct connection to cultural heritage of a specific area of the world to those who do not have access easily. To this end, many primary schools in New York have developed a project in which, owing to the ultimate high speed connection, pupils who come from abroad can learn ancient craft directly from a master located in their country of origin.To conclude, I firmly believe that traditional culture and technology development are widely compatible as the technology can positively beef up the presence of cultural traditions nowadays, so as to keep its memory Alive. In addition, pioneering projects can be implemented to underpin cultural awareness amongst youngsters.; I disagree to some extent with the idea that technology and traditional cultures are incompatible. In my opinion, it is not incompatible but compatible with traditional cultures, but how it is used. For example, the emergence of social media contributes to the spread of globalization, since people tend to adopt the same norms and values, reducing the need for more traditional forms of storytelling and cultural expression, which could be reduced. On the other hand, technological development can also lead to the disappearance of the culture. However, technology can also be used as a tool for the preservation and promotion of traditional cultures. For example, the indigenous tribes in India and their oral history can disappear when the younger generation turns to technology for entertainment and information. For example, online learning platforms can help revitalize endangered languages, such as Maori and Kanaka, by providing language resources and introducing language learners to native speakers. Besides, digital museums and archives help to preserve traditional culture and historical data for future generations and make it available to more people. Technology has the potential to help us preserve and promote traditional cultures, rather than undermine them. In conclusion, if we use technology wisely and culturally sensitively, we can save and promote the traditional culture, instead of destroying it.
1117;Write about the following topic.It is now possible for scientists and tourists to travel to remote natural environment, such as the South Pole.What are advantages and disadvantages of this development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Thanks to the development of our society, individuals can now travel to isolated areas, namely the South Pole. Never has this area been exploded before so researchers could discover crucial information for thesis and tourists could appreciate a fabulous landscape. However, discovering those faraway environments could increase environment-related issues such as climatic change.South Pole is a place which has ever seen human activities before, and it seems to have numerous discoveries to make. Indeed, scientists which fauna and flora are the current studies, could find new mode of the marine life and discover new species. Moreover, people who are interested in travelling to South Pole might now do it, children who dreamed about polar animals could see them. Thus, the tourism should create new jobs and develop economic growth.Nevertheless, as each breakthrough that the society does, there are repercussions. In this case, the harmful effect of this discovery is global warming because when humans go somewhere, they let a carbon footprint which directly changes the environment. For instance, if individuals had to travel to South Pole, they would only use air or marine transport such as cruise ship which pollute the area with greenhouse gases. As a result, those greenhouse gases can warm nature which, unfortunately, would melt the ice and have a detrimental impact on the landscapes. As a consequence, in the forthcoming decades, this panorama may disappear. Thereby, if scientists want to study this natural area, they could not or in a limited way.To conclude, the advantages could be to discover new landscapes and how species can live in this hostile area. However, just going into this remote natural environment could destroy it before discovering something.; The advantages of travelling to the most remote places in the world are numerous. This development brings advantages and disadvantages. It provides scientists with a chance to conduct research in pristine environments that can lead to ground-breaking discoveries. For example, the impact of climate change on the Antarctic ice pack can be studied, which has far-reaching consequences for our understanding of global warming. On the other hand, the influx of tourists can cause pollution and damage the environment, which can damage the very habitats the scientists are trying to study. For example, the increased number of tourists in the Galapagos Islands has led to the introduction of a number of invasive species that threaten the unique bio-diversity of the islands. However, it is vital that a balance is struck between tourism and conservation, so that the benefits of travel to these remote areas can be enjoyed in a sustainable way. Another disadvantage is the cost of travel, which is prohibitive for many, thus further reducing access and thereby exacerbating social inequalities. In conclusion, travelling to the most remote natural environments brings many advantages and disadvantages, for the very people who travel there for scientific purposes can be a disadvantage.
141;Write about the following topic.Many governments think that economic progress is their most important goal. Some people,however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;This is a world that fast developing and full of pollution.there is a worldwide problem whether economic progress is the most important goal when the other types problem are increasing. In my word is economic progress is important than other problems.Firstly,this is an economic world. human life condition is base on their income. For example,there have a village with poor people. They might working hard for live but they must have no time to think about other goal. This is reason why the governments to develop social economic . it is not uncommon that government have no money to solve the problem that environment pollution and others.Second, although economic progress is necessary for people but it also lead to other problems. With the increasing income it might need more resources to build the country. If it not solved correctly that give rise to more problems. The other types of progress will have a good developing when the economic progress finished and the government get enough money.Overall , i prefer economic progress to other types of progress. The better life come from money and the solution of the other types problem are come from the good economy.; On the one hand, many governments think that economic progress is the key to the country's prosperity and competition in the world market. Strong economies bring better education, higher life expectancy and better health care. However, the notion that economic progress is the main goal of governments has been a long-standing debate among scholars and policy makers. They believe that other types of progress, such as social, environmental and cultural development, are equally important for a country. Those people argue that too much emphasis on economic progress leads to degradation of the environment, social disparity and cultural homogenization. For example, the economies of countries like South Korea and Singapore have developed rapidly in recent years and have greatly improved the lives of their citizens. But in my opinion, although economic progress is very important, it should not be at the expense of other aspects of development. Countries like Bhutan and Costa Rica have achieved remarkable balances between economic development and the preservation of natural and cultural heritage. In this way, governments can pursue a multi-faceted development strategy, aiming at economic and social well-being at the same time. For example, the Nordic countries, which are among the happiest countries in the world, have achieved a good balance between economic development and social welfare, demonstrating that economic development and other types of progress are not mutually exclusive, but are complementary goals that can be achieved together. This approach can lead to a more sustainable and contented society.
555;Write about the following topic.Many parents today organise extra classes for their children after school and at the weekends.Do you feel that this is a worthwhile thing to do or do you feel children have enough education at school?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays educational institutions are equipped with devices that were unimaginable only a few years ago, which offer many opportunities to children to study every kind of subject. In other words, the technology introduced in schools helps many children to learn various subjects with different gadgets, such geography, art, maths by computers or history by means of audio-visual-techniques. However, I believe that children thanks to these appealing methods of learning have enough education and they need some time to unwind and experience their life with other activites.To begin with, apply children to extra classes at the weekends has become an issue of debate by many people. I hold firmly to the belief that children after schools need to dedicate their free time on sports. However, sports and other physical activities help young people to enhance their concentration, self-esteem and cognitive skills, social skills with their peer group. For example the most popular and suitable to children are sports with teams, such as football, basketball etc... where children could learn how to collaborate with other mates and the leadership skills gained in sports can help kids to excel in school, life and in the workplace, such as organising a good teamwork.On the other hand, there are few parents who argue that children need to attend extra classes at schools during the weekends. For instance, the world is still facing a global pandemic of covid-19, which caused many problems of attendency of students in many educational institutions due to various measures introduced. However this led many students to lazyness and reduction of methods of gaining knowledge, because it is widely believed that online lessons are not interactive as the lessons in presence. Moreover using continously a technological gadget for hours may cause distraction and negative mental effects. So the better solution for some people is to let their children do extra classes in presence in order to make up for the hours lost during the online lessons.To sum up, children need to experience different activities afterschool in order to have a good educational career. However some parents consider the extra classes an acceptable opportunity to not lose the methods of studying.; In my opinion, it depends on the child’s needs and circumstances. It has become very common for parents to give their children extra lessons after school or at the weekend. Some people believe this makes the children more competitive while others feel it adds too much pressure. For example, a child who is not very good at mathematics can benefit from extra lessons in order to improve their performance and pass exams. Another child, who has a talent for music or art, can also take extra lessons in order to develop their talent. However, children also need to relax and play, so that they can balance their life between school and other activities. Some children already have a full education at school, so there is no need for extra lessons. If a child has too many lessons, it may lead to lack of motivation and a lack of self-esteem. Extra lessons can be useful for some children, but parents should be aware of the child’s individual needs. This would help to ensure that the child’s education is not compromised. In conclusion, extra lessons can be useful for some children, but parents should be aware of their children’s individual needs. If there is a balance between school and other activities, the children can grow up happy, healthy and well-adjusted.
305;Write about the following topic.Many people use written language in a less formal and more relaxed way. Why? Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, written language is used in comparatively more informal and relaxed way. I assume that it happens because of the need of making communication easier and faster. Without features of formal written language it is simplier to share your idea in a shorter period of time. This option is essential in a modern temp of life. This essay will cover both advantages and disadvantages of this development.The less formal and tense written language provides some pros. First of all, without formalization the process of communication requires less amount of time. Then letters consists of less number of symbols and can help to solve the discussed problem much faster. Moreover, this way of communication does not support formal borders between members of a dialogue. Then it is easier to come closer with the interlocutor and feel no pressure during the using of written language.On the other hand, development of making written language more informal and relaxed has some cons. Firstly, communication goes less respectful. Then interlocutors have almost no opportunity to pay a respect to each other. Formalized written language is significant in issue of social borders that can hihlight a paid respect. Secondly, sometimes the main gist of the letter goes unclear, because informal language is more relaxed. In these conditions, the quidity of the letter can be hidden with less formal features. If participants of the communication are not close, they will not understand each other correctly.In conclusion I would like to say that the process of using written language in a more informal way has both advantages and disadvantages. It can be revealed in different situations. That is why everyone should have their own opinion based on the information discussed in this essay.; Write at least 150 words and use the words and phrases in the box below. The way people write has changed considerably over the last decade. Many people now use a less formal and more relaxed tone in their writing, especially in the form of digital communications. Twitter and Facebook, for example, tend to encourage a conversational style of writing, without the more formal requirements of more traditional written language. One reason for this is that our daily life is becoming more casual, which is reflected in the way we communicate with others, and so more informal in tone and language. On the one hand, a less formal writing style is often quicker and more effortless, as it makes it easier for people to express themselves freely and naturally. But this has its advantages and disadvantages. On the other hand, the brevity and brevity required by digital communications has also led to a less formal writing style, with people using abbreviations, emojis and so on to make their writing more accessible. Besides, the casual tone of writing often reduces the importance of grammar, punctuation and spelling, which are essential for good communication. On the other hand, the loss of formal writing skills can cause confusion and misunderstandings, which could be detrimental to the course of a relationship. However, in a less formal and more relaxed tone of written language, a certain balance must be found between formality and casualness, in order to write efficiently, effectively and respectfully. In conclusion, the trend towards a less formal and more relaxed tone of written language is a natural consequence of the digital era.
1161;Write about the following topic.More and more people are relying on the private car as their major means of transportation.Describe some of the problems over-reliance on cars can cause, and suggest at least one possible solution.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;That of trasportation is a question that have troubled all the people over the world, whatever it is the city or town in which they live. In the last years people used to relying on the private car to move around. . Although the possible reasons that persuaded people to use private cars, the problems that rise from their excessive use, such us traffic and pollution, are harsh consequences to be accepted. I think that an improvement of public trasportation and to incentive the use of ecological means of trasport like bicycle should be possible solution to those issues.Cars are considered the most confortable mean of trasport. In particular, if you have to move in a big cities like Milan. Indeed, means of trasports sometimes are late or full and also more unsafe. If you are a woman, for example, the use of public trasportation in some part of Italy is not safe mostly during the night hours. Another problem is that of comfort. If people use their car they can go whethever they want, when they want. If they have to spend more time in a place, they have not to be worried about the last bus they had to take to come back home.However, over-reliance of cars cause at least two big problmes: traffic and pollution. On the one hand, the problem of traffic will produce other issues such as anxiety and irritation. Indeed, if you have to go work in the morning and you live in a city like Rome you have to consider at least one hour spent in the traffic. Pollution is surely the most severe issue. Indeed, if all the people used to take a private car, then it is easely imaginable how much cars and fuel can be consumed daily. The two problems are linked, I want to underline, indeed, the noise pollution that derives from an intense traffic. It should be considered dangerous both for persons and animals.Two possible solutions to the problem of the over-reliance on cars are the following. Firstly, public trasportation should be improved. Indeed, if bus and tram were more safe and more confortable, then people would be more tent by their use. At least, they will solve the problem of traffic. On the other hand, I see the echologycal means of transport like bycicle as the new border to pass in order to save the world from pollution. One possible suggestion would be that of make cheaper the bycicle and also to give an economic subsidy to those people who decide to help the planet using them.In conclusion, I believe that the the use of private cars, because of the problems that it causes, should be discouraged. Two possible solutions rely on the improvement of public trasportation and on the incentive can be given to those using non-polluting means of trasport; Over-reliance on cars can cause many problems, affecting not only the environment but also the quality of life in cities. The most significant of these problems is the increased congestion, which leads to wasted time, more air pollution, and higher stress levels. Another problem resulting from the over-reliance on cars is urban sprawl, the expansion of cities outward toward the countryside, which leads to the destruction of agricultural land and the creation of additional costly public works projects such as new roads and car parks. In addition, the emissions from vehicles contribute to climate change and contribute to air pollution, which has major health consequences for people. I think one solution to these problems is the development and improvement of public transportation systems. Public transportation, especially bus and subway systems, can significantly reduce the number of private vehicles on the roads, thus reducing both congestion and emissions. I also think that by making pedestrian and bicycle friendly, sustainable transportation options more attractive, it will be possible to reduce the number of cars on the roads, and help to create more liveable and environmentally friendly cities for future generations. In conclusion, the over-reliance on private cars is an urgent problem, which requires immediate attention. It is up to governments, city planners, and individuals to work together to develop and implement effective solutions, and to help create a healthier and more sustainable future.

The following essay will fully endorse the statement and examine the reasons behind it.Firstly, there are several reasons why people forgot about the message behind celebrations. One of the most significant one is globalisation. As people start connecting with each other through social media worldwide, many people are too distracted with the latest trends and updates. A study from Yales University mentioned that 60% of the population on earth do not persuit the stories about their traditional roots and background. Hence, they do not celebrate festive or cultural events meaningfully. Another important reason is broken families. People who experienced a tough childhood without a male or female parent are not capable of understanding their own traditions and values. Therefore, they do not grasp the concept of cultural celebrations.Moreover, there are also cons to this arguments as people just want to take a holiday break. Although people may argue that it is important to remember the intention behind diverse celebrations, others just want to use the day for self-fulfillment purposes. For example, people would organise a party and invite friends over to their house so they can have a good time. Another argument that people only want enjoyment during festive periods is work-stress related illnesses. The majority of middle class workers are hardworking and dedicated to their job. However, the period of time for holiday breaks are significantly short and they just want to use the celebration events to rest at home. Despite the fact that they are neglecting their duties to demonstrate the meaning behind these celebrations to the younger generations, they also have a right to take care of themselves mentally and physically before others.In conclusion, there are both sides of the argument on why people think others have forgotten the meaning behind event celebrations and why this is not neccesarily true all the time. Personally, I agree that people should always find the meaning behind these celebrations in order to understand themselves better."; I would like to agree with the opinion that people nowadays have forgotten the meaning of the festivals, because the commercialization and secularization of festivals has led them to focus more on celebrating. On the other hand, I would like to partially disagree with the opinion that people forget the meaning of the festivals nowadays and just want to have fun during festival periods. However, there are still many people and societies that still respect the traditional and religious significance of the festival. For example, Christmas and the Day of the Dead have become a major commercial event that emphasizes giving gifts, dressing up, and socializing rather than its original religious and cultural significance, which makes it easy for people to celebrate these festivals without a deep understanding or appreciation of their historical and symbolic significance. But from my own experience, I have found that while some people may be more focused on entertainment, there are still many people who still pay attention to the meaning and culture of the festival. For example, in Asian societies, the new year is a time for family reunions, blessings, and new year's resolutions as well as celebrations and fireworks. Similarly, for many people around the world, Easter and Diwali are still deeply religious and spiritual events. Although some people may have forgotten the original significance of the festival, for many others, the joy and happiness of the festival are as important as their spiritual and cultural significance. This is a way to combine the two ideas of enjoyment and respect, which many people do.

Others, however, think that music can have a negative influence on both.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Music is the moonlight in the gloomy night of life.It is the universal language of mankind.There are mixed opinions about music on whether it is advantageous or not to individuals and society.This essay will discuss about pros and cons of music being part of our life.Some people have a perception that playing or listening to music is not beneficial in any manner. They feel music separates a person from socializing and that it is a form of addiction and distraction.Especially, parents feel that their child's concentration is impacted while multitasking with music and studies.For extroverts its a sort of discomfort or hindrance.Few extroverts feel better to share their feelings and difficulties with others than staying alone and listening to a song. Few recorded instances has suggested that sad music inculcates negative thoughts and aggression while in depression.On the other hand, there are people who think that music having a negative effect on individual and society is completely preposterous.They feel that tunes produces a kind of pleasure which human nature cannot do without.Music is a form of expression of feelings rather than being a hindrance.It greatly helps people to overcome their hurdles.Soothing and melodious music gives a refreshing effect.Jazz and Pop music facilitates society to come together and dance.Concerrts helps certain groups to spend time for relaxation from their busy schedule.Not only that, singing or playing instruments is a form of expression of their feelings.The essay argued that though music is considered to be a distraction , it is a form of rejuvenation to both society and individuals of all age groups.; This essay will discuss both views and give my opinion on this subject. Music is an integral part of every society and culture, regardless of geography or language. Music has often been used as a tool for social change, with artists using their music to raise public awareness of social issues and to promote unity. On the other hand, music has been credited with numerous benefits. It can evoke emotion, build a community and provide a platform for self-expression. Music also plays an important role in preserving cultural heritage. For example, traditional music and dance are often an essential part of cultural celebrations and festivals. Moreover, listening to music has been proven to have a positive impact on mental health, helping to reduce stress and anxiety. Furthermore, too much noise from music can be a nuisance and cause noise pollution. Finally, some genres of music, such as heavy metal and gangsta rap, promote violence and misogyny. In conclusion, the effect that music has on individuals and societies depends on its context and its purpose. In my opinion, music is a two-edged sword that can bring both benefits and disadvantages. I believe that as individuals, we should take responsibility for the music we listen to and promote, to ensure that it has a positive effect on ourselves and others.
587;Write about the following topic.Nowadays, sports is a big business with high earnings for professional sports people and companies involved both financially and other ways. Is this a positive or negative development for sports?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is argued that using mobile devices is as antisocial as smoking and that in certain areas smoking has been forbidden so mobile devices should be prohibited as well. I strongly disagree with this statement because this would not solve the initial problem and could turn out expensive as well.Firstly, banning mobile devices from certain places would be exagerated. This is because smoking actually damages your body, while the use of mobile phones is comparatively harmless. For example, a recent research found out that the risk of lung cancer grows by 0,02% with every cigarette, while high screen time has less damaging side effects like the loss of concentration. Altough the use of mobile phones is sometimes antisocial, I think that we should concentrate on the origins of this problem than simply prohibit it in certain areas.Secondly, banning mobile devices would have a regulatory side effect which could be expensive. The government would have to decide on new laws as well as implement them. Furthermore, it would be no easy task for the police to control these rules in an efficient way. As a result, police would struggle with a high workload. Admittely, I have enough faith in our legal system and I am sure that they could manage it but I think that we have more prescious und urgent tasks to concentrate on.In conclusion, I strongly disagree with banning mobile devices in certain areas. However, I admit that we use our phones too much which sometimes leads to antisocial behaviour. Nevertheless, prohibiting the phones in certain areas would not solve this problem and could as well be expensive for the government.; I think that this development has both positive and negative consequences for sports. On the one hand, more money in sports means higher quality in competitions, as the top athletes can devote themselves to their training and performance without worrying about finances. On the other hand, the commercialization of sports has led to a great deal of money for professional sports people and companies, who have gotten a lot of money. A further positive consequence is that the financial investment in sports facilities has led to the construction of modern stadiums and facilities that improve the experience for spectators and athletes. On the other hand, there are some disadvantages of the commercialization of sports. For example, some of the world's best football players, such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, can earn millions of dollars in advertising and salaries, which they can use to maintain their extraordinary skills. High earnings also create high expectations and pressure on young athletes, which may lead to poor mental and physical health. In addition, the emphasis on profit in sport has led to an increase in competition rather than fair play and sportsmanship, as evidenced by the many doping scandals in track and field and cycling, where athletes have risked their health and reputation in order to get an advantage over their competitors. To keep a balance between money and sports, sports organizations and companies must put fair play and the welfare of the athletes before the lucrative business aspect. In short, the commercialization of sports has brought a lot of benefits, such as improved performances and facilities for the athletes, but has also had a great effect on the sporting integrity and the values of the sports.
1133;Write about the following topic.People in all modern societies use drugs, but today's youth are experimenting with both legal and illegal drugs, and at an increasingly early age. Some sociologists claim that parents and other members of society often set a bad example.Discuss the causes and some effects of widespread drug use by young people in modern day society. Make any recommendations you feel are necessary to help fight youth drug abuse.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The use of drugs has been a warning habit in modern day society. In some research, it shows that households are losing their financing easily due to the fact that one of the parents has been addicted to drugs. Although there are some drugs which were approved by the government to be used moderately, yet some people are using these drugs heavily.This has drawn the attention of the youth either by a drug addict parent or a friend. Moreover, the number of youngsters taking drugs has increased dramatically throughout the years as there are people who provide these drugs in the black market. This critical issue has caused serious issues both socially and mentally.The social and mental impact of using drugs by the youngsters have damaged the educational progress, the social participation such as family and friends gatherings. Additionally, lack of stamina, weight loss, and loss of appetite are key factors of excessive use of drugs.There is a number of contributing elements to the phenomena. One of these elements is the sense of belonging to a group. Since humans are social animals, young people want to have the feeling of being accepted and loved, and this can be sensible when it comes to a group of friends. Therefore, once someone introduces a drug, the rest of the group will try, and if one says no, then they will be rejected. However, this rejection can be helping to solve this alarming issue.The solution is to find a way to distinguish the types of drugs and legalize the ones that do not harm greatly and prepare in parallel the better ways to control the consumption of drugs.; One of the most important causes of drug abuse among young people in modern society is the normalization of drug use in daily life. Some sociologists believe that parents and other members of society often set bad examples which contribute to the early use of both legal and illegal drugs. Another significant factor is the lack of information and knowledge about the dangers of drug abuse. Often schools and families fail to provide information and guidance, and young people are vulnerable to the temptation of using drugs. Social media, peer pressure and even family members may all lead young people to believe that using drugs is acceptable and not harmful. It is clear that the effects of drug abuse among young people are devastating, resulting in addiction, health problems and even death. Finally, the pressure and stress of modern life, academic and social expectations, may also encourage young people to take up the use of drugs to escape from reality. For example, a study has shown that drug use among teenagers may significantly affect their school performance and increase the risk of dropping out of school. Moreover, drug use may lead to the development of mental disorders and the disruption of social relationships, thereby compromising the prospect of future employment. In order to combat youth drug abuse, it is important to provide information and education about the risks and consequences of drug use. Governments and institutions should invest in effective drug prevention and rehabilitation programmes that can help young people avoid the destructive effects of drug abuse. Also, parents, teachers and community leaders must set a good example and engage in open and honest discussions with young people.

For this reason, attention should be given to colour schemes when decorating places such as offices and hospitals.How true is this statement?How far does colour influence people’s health and capacity for work?;The colours and its affect on humans feelings always interested the psychologists and become a part of their researches. This researches get the attention of the organizations and help them to shape their designs of their offices or buildings. In this essay, I will talk about the affects of colour and its influence on some parts of human's life.It is true that certain colours are affecting our mental state and feelings at some level. Because of our visual plays an important role in our pyschology, colours are becoming important issue that needs to be point out. For example, the alertness effect of red colour on human's feeling is well known by the goverments. In order to alert people, stop signs or traffic lights are always include some level of red colour. This way, humans can be warned and accidents numbers can be decreased.Also, this affect of colours can play a big role in our health and work place. To give an example, the infinity effect of white colour is always used by hospitals. They paint their desks, tables, rooms, bathrooms or walls to white colour most of the time. This way, they calm their patients and help them to relieve their stress. Another example is grey. It is one of the favourite colour of the companies. They use this colour mainly in their office to make sure their employees are not distracted so they can finish their task.To conclude, colours are very affective in our mood and feelings. They are being used by the organizations to benefit from this effect.; The statement that attention should be given to colour schemes when decorating offices and hospitals is certainly true. Psychologists have long been interested in the effects of colour on human emotions and behaviour. Colours like blue and green are known to produce a sense of calm and serenity which may be useful in a stressful working environment, whereas colours like orange and yellow increase energy and creativity and are appropriate for work requiring ingenuity and creative thinking. In the case of office workers, colour can stimulate or calm them depending on the required result. Colours like light blue and green, which can induce serenity and reduce patients’ anxiety and fear, are recommended for use in the surgery, while red and purple, which stimulate the brain, encourage the doctors to be more alert and attentive. The same principles can be applied to hospitals. In order to assist in the patient’s speedy recovery and to increase the efficiency of the doctors and nurses, colour should be used strategically. In experiments it has been proven that exposure to certain colours can lower blood pressure, heart rate and stress, and improve mood and concentration. There is a considerable influence of colour on people’s health and ability to work. This suggests that the statement is true, and that consideration of colour schemes should be given priority when decorating such places. The use of colours can create environments which promote mental alertness, physical well-being and emotional balance, and thus enhance the health and well-being of patients and employees.
1173;Write about the following topic.Rich countries should allow jobs for skilled and knowledgeable employees who are from poor countries. Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"In development countries they must allow works for people who have skills and experience employees from poor countries. I agree with this point of view because everyone they should have a chance. There were a opportunities and benefits.The first point, I would like to make is that there were a great opportunities for both rich countries and people who came from poor areas. When people thinking to transfer abroad there were many reason but the most important when they want a chance to show of there craft and ability. Such as, Indian people they travelled many areas and they give them a lot of discoveries and skills; moreover, the rich countries need some people to help to make their country better place for living. For example, I have read an article in the newspaper they talked about development countries like UK, US and Arabic countries they need those people to improve their economy and life.The second point, I will clarify is that there were many benefits when this countries allow jobs for those. They will be equality for all ;furthermore, there will be a improvement in living. For instance, I have saw a T.V decomontry they say "" In United States there are a equality and improvement in live between people they came from Africaand citizens they help them to have good education, skills and experience also they contribute the US economy to growth "".Finally, we can say that there were a opportunities and benefits for both sides. I am with this to have good life for all. I hope in the future poor countries they can take benefits from those people and developed their country to came better than now ."; In my opinion, this is a very good idea. The ability of skilled employees from poor countries to find work in rich countries can bring many benefits to both sides. Doctors and nurses from poor countries, for example, can help to solve the problem of the lack of doctors and nurses in rich countries and improve the quality of health care. On the other hand, rich countries can benefit from the arrival of skilled workers who bring their own opinions, new knowledge and special skills, which may not be available in their country. Finally, these employees can participate in the economic growth of their country by paying taxes and buying things. This brain gain can eventually benefit poor countries and help them to develop their economy. Finally, skilled employees from poor countries can benefit from the ability to work in rich countries, they can benefit from the higher salary, better conditions and more experience that they can bring back to their home country. The presence of such employees in rich countries can result in the development of cultural diversity, economic growth and the transfer of knowledge. For example, Indian software engineers working in the United States can go back to India and start their own IT companies, which will help develop the economy and create more jobs. So, rich countries should be open to skilled employees from poor countries, because this can benefit both the host country and the countries where these employees come from.
973;Write about the following topic.Some organisations believe that their employees should dress smartly. Others value quality of work above appearance.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Manners in the workplace have always been a topic that is discussed by many people as it is essential to know how we should behave in such a formal environment. Some companies give the opinion that their workers should have a smart look while others consider the attitude toward the job more important.To my mind, appearance should not the only thing to be considered. We can dress smartly and impress others, but it is only the first impression. Therefore, productivity, quality of work, and the way we are responsible for our tasks are things that make us outstanding workers. Moreover, it is obvious that the success of one company does not depend on how its employees dress but on how it is organized.In spite of the fact that dressing does not play a key role in the value of a worker, a neat and intelligent appearance still gives us significant benefits. I always suggest that one should dress suitably in different situations. In fact, it is not crucial for an organization to ask their employees to dress formally, but a set of smart casual clothes is something that we should wear when it comes to the working environment. It is because that wearing politely shows how we respect our jobs, our employers, and even our workmates. In some cases, a company's professionalism can be seen through the way its workers wear.To sum up, dressing smartly is not the best and only thing that one worker can do to have better performance. However, having a good appearance is something that great employees would do since it can be considered as their respect for the jobs.; Such a dress code may be required, for example, by banks and law firms, in order to make the clients trust and rely on them. Dress code is a very important issue for the employees of the organisations. As for some other companies, the emphasis is on the quality of work rather than on the appearance. This is a popular trend, for example, in IT companies and in start-ups, where the main thing is innovation and creativity. In addition, such a dress code may motivate employees, make them feel ready for work. In my opinion, the quality of work should be more important than the appearance of the employees. They should be able to dress casually, which may help to make a more friendly and united atmosphere in the office, where employees will be more satisfied and productive. For example, such well-known companies as Google and Facebook, with their casual dress code, not only do not harm their success, but also help them to be more creative and dynamic. On the other hand, a strict dress code can destroy the creativity and individuality of employees, which are necessary for innovation and development. Dressing up, although useful, does not always have to be compulsory. On the contrary, I believe that quality of work, the ability to focus on the tasks and individuality, should be more important than the strict dress code.

Others believe that some information is too important or too valuable to be shared freely.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In recent years, some people believe that it is good to share information about scientific research, business and the academic field to many people. Others reckon that such informations are too important or too valuable to be share for free. Here are discussions of the statements and my opinion.By development of the technology, people can more likely to access to valuable information such as experimental results and interviewing results of citizens than before. Some people use it for their academic interests or for the business strategies, so that people believe that such information contribute to companies profits or individuals' advantages in academic. For example, many of the medical students read dissertation of diseases, which were written in the past. By reading and using the scientific information students will become excellent professionals.On the other hand, people can access informations from any countries via internet. Recently, increasing the cyber crimes is the serious problem all over the world. Therefore some people reckon that it is too risky to share valuable informations. If information on valuable national research results is leaked, the country would had enormous loss for the economy.To sum up ,sharing as much informations as possible is useful for the everyone to improve their academic skills and contribute to their companies, while easier access to every aspects of informations might bring disadvantages such as information leakage or cybercrime. In my opinion, I mostly agree with it is good to share information, but I believe the source of information needs to be careful not to misuse the sources.; In recent years there has been a great deal of debate about the benefits and disadvantages of sharing information in the business, research and academic world. On the one hand, some people argue that sharing information is useful because it encourages innovation, enables people to build on the work of others and achieve great things. In the field of medicine, for example, open research and data sharing has contributed to many major advances and has led to the achievement of remarkable results. Moreover, a company’s trade secrets and intellectual property are some of its most valuable assets, and sharing such information could lead to unfair competition, financial losses and even bankruptcy. On the other hand, others argue that some information is too valuable or too sensitive to be shared freely. If this is the case, it is important to protect this information. Similarly, in the academic world, it is not always useful to share new discoveries before they are published, as others might then take credit for them or profit from their ideas. In my opinion, there should be a balance between the two views. Information should be shared between trusted parties and shared in a controlled environment, such as peer review. This approach can help to protect valuable information from being used inappropriately. This can help to avoid some of the disadvantages of sharing information and enable people to benefit from its advantages.
273;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Environmental problems are the biggest issue that people have to concern and by product form fossil fuels is one of causes. Someone think one way that can reduce result from fuels is sale car fuels in higher price. In my opinion, I disagree with this because highly price of oil leads to other problems such as financial problem and impact to food price, moreover, we can heal their environment by other ways.The negative effects of increasing the cost of vehciles fuels are improtant to human life. The significant points is price of basic requirements, for instance, foods and medicines which have to transportation by trucks that use oil fuels for movement. The expensive fuels increase business costs, so their products price are rising up. Futhermore, social problems follow by financial problems. When poor people do not have money but they still hunger, they will steal some food or water this situation roads to social problems.Other ways to reduce environment problems, the causes of this problem are not only fossil fuel but also agricultural or industial aspect which we have to focus on. Intustial areas are the top areas that make lot of pollutions such as air pollution, water pollution from thier procesing and chemical pollution which they use during process. Those of them lead to many problems and effect to qulity of human life. Moveover agricultural areas, there produce many of gas which result to global warming.In conclusion, the increasing car fuels might reduce some of environmental problems but also have drawback to population life. We should to chooce other ways to protect enviromant without effect to our life.; In my opinion, I partially agree with this statement, because I believe that increasing the price of fuel can have both a positive and a negative effect on the environment. The idea that the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles can help to solve the problem of the environment has been widely discussed in recent years. Increased fuel costs, on the one hand, can have a positive effect on the environment, because people will use public transport, walk or ride bicycles, which will reduce the negative impact of transportation. On the other hand, the increase in fuel costs can have a negative effect on low-income families and enterprises that rely on transportation. For example, high taxes on fuel in Norway and Sweden have led to a significant increase in the number of electric and hybrid cars, resulting in a significant decrease in emissions. In addition, it may lead to the use of alternative, but not less polluting fuels, such as coal and wood, which will also increase the burden on the environment. In conclusion, increasing the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles can be an effective measure to reduce the negative impact on the environment, but it is not the only solution. In countries with poor public transport, higher fuel costs can increase the cost of living and the standard of living of many people. In my opinion, a comprehensive approach that takes into account the economic, social and environmental factors is necessary in order to effectively resolve the problem of the environment. I believe that the government should consider a wide range of measures, such as the development of public transport, the introduction of alternative energy sources, the implementation of appropriate taxes and subsidies to encourage people to use less harmful fuels.
135;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that school children should not be given homework by their teachers, whereas others argue that homework plays an important role in the education of children.Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The issue that whether teachers should assign homework or not has attracted great attention recently.Some people believe that homework is a good way to consolidate students'learning effect.However,others argue that homework exerts huge pressure on students,which is bad for their long-term development.As for me,appropriate homework should be seen as the better choice.I will explain my idea from two aspects.Firstly,homework could examine student's learning results.After teaching the basic content,giving some homework is important to consolidate the knowledge.As an old saying goes,practice makes things perfect.Only doing many practices,can we master the knowledge proficiently.There is an example.In my teaching experiences,I found the students finishing their homework better would achieve higher scores in final examination,while those who couldn't finish their ordinary homework would gain lower grades in any examination.And my translation skills were also improved by practicing the homework from my guiders who gave the targeted examination to me.Secondly,too much homework will cause so many negative effects,such as making students tired very much,causing their depressed mood and their bored emotion.For example,my brother's daughter always suffered from the huge homework which was assigned by his Chinese teacher.She once complained with me that everyday she felt tired and bored after finishing Chinese teacher's assignments.So appropriate homework is reasonable for most students and those ideas that the more homework,the better students' scores ,are wrong to certain extent.Sometimes huge homework is the reason that why some students'scores are reduced.In sum,removing homework is not an ideal option for student's improvement in learning,and reasonable homework provides us a better way to deal with the problem.That is to say,we should strike a balance between assigning homework and removing homework.; On the one hand, some people think that homework is not necessary and that it can be harmful to children’s health and that they should have free time to play and have fun after school. The question of whether schoolchildren should be given homework is a controversial issue between teachers and parents. On the other hand, others believe that homework is an essential part of the child’s education. They think that homework helps children to remember things they have learned at school and develops their discipline and self-discipline. They also claim that it reduces stress and prevents children from getting sick. In my opinion, homework is an important part of the child’s education. For example, from my own experience, homework in mathematics helped me to understand difficult concepts and improve my problem solving skills. Homework also allows teachers to see how well the child understands a particular subject and provide additional support. In addition, it develops in children the ability to organize and plan their time, and self-discipline. On the other hand, homework should be meaningful, relevant, and not superfluous. It is true that too much homework can be harmful to children, but moderate amounts of homework can help children solidify their knowledge and prepare them for future academic challenges. Homework is a valuable tool in a child’s education, and I believe it should remain a part of the learning process. If a child learns to love school, he will achieve academic success and develop his abilities.
525;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child's development while others think that it is important for children to go to school.Discuss the advantages of both methods and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In regards to the notion 'it is important for children to go to school', there are two contrasting opinions of supporting it and also disagreeing with it. Schools are conceptually thought to be essential and compulsory for many parents while others may not despite of what the society says.There are people who suggest that going to school is indeed necessary for children and students as it enables them to develop social ability and make friends which will ultimately be useful in the future. Attending school, a microsom of society, itself already teaches young students how to interact with other people ouside of family tree. Those who did not attend school when they were young may have severly low EQ or lacking interaction ability. For instance, an adult who was studying at home might not know how to respect and share objects with others. By being enrolled in a school, children can make remarkable childhood memories that may help them in the future when they are in a slump or depression.On the other hand, some people may disagree to this notion as they think studying at home is far more effective. Their argument might be that going to school would be a waste of time as children usually play around at school. Teaching children can be much more efficient as transportation time and playing time can be eliminatied by not going to school. Furthermore, as children do not have to go out, there will not be any conflicts on bullying or fight with friends. They will not fall onto deviation such as smoking, drinking et cetera which are usually encountered at school due to bad friends. Also, money can be saved by teaching at home as uniforms, for example, do not have to purchased.All in all, although young students might have number of advantages by not going to school, it is nevertheless more important to attend school in a daily basis to improve their social ability and interaction with other people.; In this essay I will discuss the advantages of both methods and give my own opinion. Parents and educators are arguing about the best way to raise children. Home education is sometimes more successful than school education. Children who are taught at home can learn to do it more effectively. Home education is flexible and can be adapted to the needs, interests and abilities of the child. On the other hand, going to school has many advantages, such as socializing with others, diversity and using school equipment. For example, my friend had a serious illness and was taught at home, so she developed socially and academically. In my opinion, school is the best way to develop a child. First of all, going to school gives children the opportunity to develop their talents and interests. For example, my younger siblings, by attending school, have learned to become good friends and have been able to develop their talents and abilities. However, I also think that home education is the best way for some children with special needs and circumstances that require a more flexible approach. Secondly, schools give children a well-rounded education and prepare them for the increasingly complex and interconnected world. In conclusion, the choice between home education and school education depends on the needs and circumstances of the child.
323;Write about the following topic.Some people believe women are better leaders than men. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is argued by some individuals that men aren't skilled enough as women in regard to leadership. This essay disagrees with the given statement as leadership skills are not depending on gender but are strongly related to people's personality and work experience.The role of a leader should not be stereotyped according to gender, for example, women might be considered more powerful than men because they could normally appear more organised and perfectionist. Indeed, several studies concerning leadership and the role of the leader, have demonstrated that some people have innate attitudes of a leader regardless of their gender. Some of those attitudes are related to active listening, emotional intelligence skills and great communication abilities. Thus, if effectively developed and fostered, those skills can support individuals to achieve higher roles in leadership and management.In the same way, the working experience also plays a crucial role in determining and further developing leadership skills. For example, a large number of women are still renouncing to their career paths in order to care for their families. Indeed, most of the women, apply for part-time roles which do not offer the opportunity to achieve a leadership role despite their abilities. For this reason, is difficult to affirm if women are better than men in leadership.To conclude, the role of a leader is shaped by innate characteristics and people's personalities regardless of their gender. Moreover, the poor presence of women employed in leadership roles does not create pieces of evidence to support such a point of view.; In my opinion, I agree partially with this statement. There have been cases where women have demonstrated leadership qualities. But I also believe that leadership is not the exclusive domain of one gender. For example, Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, has shown exceptional leadership in managing the European financial crisis. Jacinda Ardern, Prime Minister of New Zealand, has demonstrated exceptional leadership in responding to the H1N1 pandemic with a humanitarian and decisive approach to governing. In addition, leadership is not a matter of gender but of skills, experience, and character. On the other hand, many men have also demonstrated leadership. For example, the role of Nelson Mandela in the liberation of South Africa was a great example of courage and decisiveness in leadership. Finally, leadership is a complex quality that cannot be reduced to one single factor. However, I do not think that women are superior to men. There are different leadership styles, and each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. By recognizing the value of these differences, we can create a more equitable and more effective leadership.
247;Write about the following topic.Some people feel that manufacturers and supermarkets have the responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging of goods. Others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Packing of goods has become a noticeable issue nowadays, especially in terms of environmental concerns and sustainable development of society. In order to reduce the amount of packaging, some people believe that manufacturers and supermarkets are more responsible for taking measures, while others insist that customers play a more critical role in reality. In my view, the effort needs to be made by the supplier and the consumer both to guarantee the achievement of the goal.On the one hand, the problem of over-packaging is often caused by commercial strategy. The supplier attempts to use beautiful packaging to make their products more attractive to customers. It is fairly easy to imagine that people would be more likely to choose a product decorated gorgeously than the same one with a plain appearance provided that there is thus no significant increase in price. Following that, producers would try to make every effort to obtain more competitive packaging for their products, which probably leads to excessive use of the wrap. Therefore, it is undoubtedly the duty of the producer to partake in reducing the amount of over-packaging by finding another way to improve the competitiveness of their products instead of merely attaching more value to their appearance.On the other hand, the behaviors of customers give rise to over-packaging as well. The more attention that people will pay to the appearance of goods, the more encouraged producers will be to exert themselves on wrapping. Moreover, the public awareness about the harmful influence of over-packaging is also profound in decreasing the amount of packaging. As customers take the problems caused by over-packaging into account, they would be more willing to purchase the goods with less packaging, which is a highly practical way to prevent producers from wrapping unduly.In conclusion, it is clear that suppliers and customers both are responsible for the trend of over-packaging. Therefore, the success of altering the situation needs the participation of them both.; Many people feel that manufacturers and large stores have a moral obligation to reduce the amount of packaging of goods. This view seems reasonable, because these companies have the opportunity to make such solutions sustainable and affordable. On the other hand, others argue that consumers should not buy goods with excessive packaging. According to this view, consumers should make rational decisions and not buy goods with excessive packaging. Many companies have introduced biodegradable or recyclable materials, which significantly reduce waste. On the other hand, manufacturers and large stores have the power to promote the use of natural materials in the supply chain. This is done for example by cosmetic companies offering their products in refills, which not only reduces the amount of waste but also saves the buyer money. However, the other view also seems reasonable, because customer behavior and the choice of goods has a strong influence on the market. According to this view, it is necessary to converge the needs of consumers and producers, which is what will lead to the reduction of waste. In my opinion, it is both manufacturers and consumers who are responsible for reducing the amount of waste that is created in the distribution chain. Therefore, a combination of both views can help us reduce the negative impact of packaging on the environment and bring us closer to a sustainable future.
181;Write about the following topic.Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding change. Others, however, think that change is always a good thing.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people rather doing the same things over and over avoiding change, meanwhile others consider change as a positive thing. Some people are probably afraid of change and for this reason they prefer staying in the confort zone because it's something familiar. On the other hand, others believe that change is a good opportunity to grow and discover new things.Changing it's not for everybody, because there are people that doesn't like it, so they try to avoid it. Spending the whole life doing the same thing is not as bad as change for some people. This is probably linked to the fact that sometime change is something unknown. So, sometime people prefere to stay in their confort zone because even if it's not the best at least is something familiar. For example, people that hate their jobs but are stuck with it, is because they're too afraid to change it and land in a worse place or position. So they rather stay in that place because they're too afraid to lose it and end up worse. I believe that this is an understandable and common reason around people, however i believe that change can give more chances for improvement.Other people believes that change is always a positive thing. Changing is an opportunity to grow and discover new things, It's a chance to achieve something better and improve. There are people who doesn't like to be in the same place (phisically, economically or emotionally) and prefer changing. For instance, going to a new country because the idea of living in the same place forever is not charming enough, so find out new places to see, and places to feel confortable ,emotionally and economically for instance, is something that only people who are hungry enough of change would do it. I believe that sometime it's better risk it than live the same life everyday.In conclusion, the preference about change depends on people and wheter is beneficial or not depends on the different point of views and situations. I think, that change is important, everything change even if try to avoid it. So, it's better embrace it because no matter how things go it will leave you either with an experiece or with a lesson. So, in my opinion change is a good thing.; On the one hand, some people prefer to stay in the same situation, because they think it is more comfortable and predictable. They argue that routine creates stability, and that changing the structure of life will bring uncertainty and chaos. The question of whether change is a good or a bad thing has long been discussed. On the other hand, others believe that change is always good, because it brings new experiences, opportunities and personal growth. On the other hand, a person who has lived in the same town all his life may feel a strong sense of community and be reluctant to move to another city. But the familiarity of routine can lead to the stagnation of the spirit. I personally think that change is essential for personal development and growth. For example, a person who has never traveled abroad will be inspired to explore new cultures and meet new people, which will result in a broader worldview and more self-confidence. In addition, the opportunity to try new things can bring new opportunities and experiences, enriching our lives and making us feel fulfilled. Whether it's a new job, a new hobby or a new place to live, change forces people to adapt and grow, giving them greater resilience and self-awareness. In short, by embracing change, people can break free of their comfort zone and become more confident and self-aware. In conclusion, while some people prefer not to change, others believe that change is necessary and beneficial.
149;Write about the following topic.Some people think living in big cities is bad for people’s health.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In the past decades, the rise of urbanization has brought trends of moving into the cities. While some people believe that the availability of resources and welfare in metropolises can outweigh the unhealthy environment, I strongly believe that the fancy infrastructures come in exchange for health sacrifice.To begin with, most megacities are overpopulated. With scarce resources and higher demands in every aspect, products and services received in these bustling locations usually come at a higher price, lower quality and longer waiting time. For example, it could take up to weeks or months to queue up for non-urgent medical services while it takes only a few days or even without booking in non-busy areas. Moreover, the nature of crowded areas accelerates the spreading of transmittable diseases during the pandemic.Another undeniable health factor for those residing in cities is pollution. Most cities come with traffic issues where there are exceeding amounts of cars which create air pollution. It is proved that, in long term, smog in the air could result in respiratory diseases such as lung cancer. Furthermore, the number of the city's population is equal to the extremely large amount of waste and without an appropriate waste management system, it could lead to several more problems. One of them is pests such as mice and bugs which are the perfect mediums for severe diseases such as rabies.All in all, urbanization has tremendous benefits to human society as a whole and is unavoidable in the present context. Thus, governments should focus on addressing these issues to ensure the sustainable progress of cities and the citizens' quality of life.; In my opinion, I agree with this statement partly. In the big city, there are many benefits such as the advanced medical service and many job opportunities, but the disadvantages of this city are also very obvious. Besides, the fast and pressured city life is very tiring for the body, leading to various mental diseases such as depression and anxiety. A recent study in Tokyo, Japan, has found that the city's air pollution has increased the risk of heart disease by two-thirds, which affects the health of people in the city. Compared with other cities, New York has a number of parks, recreation areas and green spaces, where residents can enjoy the beautiful environment and physical exercise. Although there are many advantages and disadvantages of urban life, it is the right balance between the two that determines whether a person can be healthy.
1151;Write about the following topic.Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.Discuss both views and give your opinionGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Art takes a big role in life , if we look around , we can see art around us everywhere , however some people think art in school is wasting time and teachers should focus on sience subjests , while others believe that art lessons is as important in school as math ,science and language. This article will explain in fully with reasons why art should be taught for children in school .There is understading that reading , writing and mathematics are the most topics we should concentrate our children to learn during school time and that idea is somehow correct but , some subjects like art , music and potery also play pivotal rolein our life however , speaking of art for instance , scientists claim that art can show creativity of child and help teachers to guide them to talented children , furthermore, children are different to show their expression , some of them find a better way in art to express their feelings and that will help teachers and even parents for better understanding for their children , also this way will help children to strenghten their confidence during study .To conclude , although as a general perception for some parents that the main purpose to send their children to the school is to learn reading , writing , math and other sciences , there is understaing that time also should be given to other topics like art in order to figure out and use skills that children have .; In this essay, I will discuss both views and give my opinion. It is a long-standing debate between teachers and parents whether art should be taught in schools. For example, in many schools, art classes are the first to be cancelled when the budget is short. People believe that art does not teach children the skills needed for future employment and that it is a waste of time and money. However, I think that art classes are very important for children because they help children express themselves, build self-confidence and explore their imagination. On the other hand, I firmly believe that art is an essential subject for children to learn. As a result, art is an important part of history and culture, and art lessons help children understand and learn about the world. For example, art projects can teach children about different historical periods, artistic movements and social issues. In conclusion, I believe that by introducing art to the school curriculum, we can raise a generation of creative, empathetic and well-rounded individuals who can succeed in all areas of life. Art classes teach a unique set of skills that cannot be replaced by other subjects.
221;Write about the following topic.Some people think that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is believed that responsibility for the rise in obesity in children is on government. I strongly disagree with this opinion. I think that state policy cannot lead to the people's obesity. Moreover, I am sure that only parents are responsible for their children diseases.First of all, it is important to say that government's actions can not be followed with the obesity. It is responsible only for control that all available products are not dangerous for people's health. Food that consist of a lot of fats do not put your health under the threat after the first consumption. Only overeating of this kind of food can be harmful for your health leading obesity. For instance, there is no government's responsibility if you go to the mall and buy 6 cans of beer providing health problem for yourself. I am sure that government is responsible only for making 1 can of beer acceptable for your health.Secondly, children's actions and potential consequences of these actions should be controlled by their parents. Obesity can be a result of a permanent overeating. Because of their age, chilldren cannot control themselves. That is why this responsibility goes on their parents. As it was mentioned before, there is no product that can be harmful for the healh after the first and the only consumption. There is no reason to condemn government because of the permanent consumption of any products. For example, child could eat 3 pieces of cake insted of 1 just because of his wish. In this case, his parents should stop him after the first one to avoid potential obesity.In conclusion, I would like to say that I do not see any reasons to say that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children. It has no responsibility for people's overeating and lack of parents' control over their children.; In my opinion, the government plays a role but not the only one. The increasing trend of obesity in children has raised a heated discussion about who is responsible for this trend. For example, the government can influence the food industry by setting standards for nutritional content and advertising practices. If the government fails to regulate companies, it will continue to advertise unhealthy food to children and this will lead to the rise in obesity. On the other hand, I think that parents and individuals should also take responsibility for preventing childhood obesity. For example, the budget for physical education and school sports facilities can also affect the level of exercise children can do. If there is not enough money, the children can not do sports. In addition, schools and communities can also provide sports, cooking and other programs that support healthy lifestyles. Parents are responsible for providing a balanced diet and allowing their children to do sports. In conclusion, I believe that the government is not the only one who is responsible for childhood obesity. It is important for parents, schools, communities and individuals to support and educate children so that they can live a healthy life.
189;Write about the following topic.Some people think that we should divide students based on their academic ability, while others think we should educate all students together. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people argue that students who have noticeable abilities and nice educational skills in academics should be separated during the learning process. The other says that it is no object who a better in education who not they should study together. I believe that it is terrible idea to include separation among students.On the one hand, when students with strong and weak academic abilities educate separately, teachers could control the learning process more thoroughly. In this way the teacher could give them more difficult tasks and focus on really relevant topics. A good example of this are private schools with fees and entering exams. It is the fact that there students in final classes have better knowledge than in common schools.On the other hand, when students with different skills educate together the strong students will help weak ones. In these classes there are standards and all students should follow them and there are opportunities to ask schoolmates how to solve some task correctly. The nice example of this is my school. If I did not know how to solve a task I would have a chance to wait for help from my more wise mate.In conclusion, although separate education will give a chance to learn a lot of difficult tasks and it helps teachers, the losing way of asking help if you do not know how to solve the task would be devastating for the educational process. In addition, it could be separated by abilities and wisdom, anyway it is an awful idea.; One may think that it is better to divide students based on their academic ability in order to provide them with the more appropriate teaching methods, so that they can learn better. Moreover, it is possible to individualize the curriculum to the needs of each group of students. However, if all students are taught in the same class, it is difficult to ensure that the needs of the individual student will be met, and students may feel that the teacher does not know them enough to teach them. One may also think that by putting students of different academic abilities in the same class, it encourages the development of a more social attitude, equality, and mutual help. Moreover, students who are gifted in a subject may be given a challenge, while those who are less capable may be given extra support. Students who are strong in one subject, for example, mathematics, can help those who are weaker in it, and vice versa. It also helps to eliminate social prejudices, and students of different abilities learn to work together, communicate and understand each other. Moreover, with appropriate teaching methods and resources, teachers can teach students of all academic abilities. In my opinion, educating all students together is more beneficial. Ultimately, it is important for academic excellence, social cohesion and personal development to educate students of all academic abilities together.
569;Write about the following topic.Some teachers think that international student exchange would be beneficial for all teenage school students.Do you think its advantages will outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The international student exchange is getting more popular in many high schools in big cities. This operation brings many advantages which would be beneficial for teenager students. Though, here some disadvantages still exist.Firstly, I think one of disadvantages is that lack of supervision on the international exchange teenagers as they are living in other countries. In general speaking, the youths felt strange and inadaptable at initial period. They can’t speak well foreign language, can’t communicate well with other classmates or teachers, so they might feel alone and isolate from a new circumstance. If they can’t adjust themselves well to fit in with groups as soon as possible, they will encounter more difficult things, such as studying, social and daily routine. The worse situation is that they might give up their studying, even they will mislead them into crime.On the contrary, the advantages are far more than disadvantages. For example, youths will extend their horizons. They will see and know many new things what they never seen in domestic. They would easily accept those new things than adults, because youths have curiosities all long. Furthermore, the teenagers easier to make new friends in other countries, because they are always passion and single-minded. In order to communicate with different background students from all over the world, they must cultivate their social capacities harder than before. It is the best way to elevate their skills of the foreign language is communication. Moreover, through the different viewpoint collisions the international exchange students have gained multiple and scientific logics, which will have a profound impact at the rest their lives. However, I think the simplest advantage is that most the international exchange students have possessed with an excellent foreign language ability after then come back.At the end of my essay, I think it is not suit for all teenagers to be the international exchange students. Here the teenagers must accept some selection processes under the fair and effective principles.; In my opinion, the advantages of international student exchange far outweigh the disadvantages, and I am convinced that it can have a profoundly positive influence on the lives of young people. The international student exchange program has become a popular issue among teachers who think it would be useful for high school students. The best example of this is a student from a conservative society who lives in a liberal country and comes back with a completely different view of life and a new respect for diversity. Students who study abroad learn about different cultures, societies and ways of life, so that their views become more flexible and develop a better sense of humanity and tolerance. Students who study in foreign countries also acquire language skills and thus become more employable. For example, students who go to Japan to learn the language will return to their home country and can teach it fluently and thus be more competitive on the job market. In addition, the international student exchange program provides students with valuable linguistic and academic experiences. Students who can cope with the hardships and difficulties of living abroad, supported by their families and teachers, will come back with the experience of a lifetime. But some people may say that the program is expensive, time-consuming and difficult for teenagers. In my opinion, however, the benefits are greater than the disadvantages. These skills and knowledge are essential for teenagers to cope with the increasingly interconnected world.
1003;Write about the following topic.Some universities now offer their courses on the Internet so that people can study online.Is this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It has become a popular trend that many universities have sent online courses for people to acquire knowledge through the Internet, which makes it more and more available for people to gain valuable resources and improve themselves. From my perspective, such a trend contains much benefits and it is undoubtedly a positive development.On the one hand, people can have more access to their interested expertise and delve into related fields with the help of online courses offered by universities. It is comparatively hard and inconvenient for people to attend courses in the university if they are not college students. Luckily, with myriads of online courses which are usually free and of high quality, learners merely need to register and sign in to find out some interesting courses ranging from academic knowledge to practical skills, which can afford a challenging but exciting experience for those attend the lessons.On the other hand, it is a good way for the universities to improve the quality of the courses as well as make some adaptation to the content of the courses. In order for people outside the universities to acquire knowldege effectively, online courses should cater to people's preference to some extent. It is expectable that some courses which is of great necessity and closely connected with people's daily life would be popular. Thus, universities would therefore release more high-quality courses by innovating teaching skills to meet people's needs.In conlusion, I think online courses provided by universities can surely make a positive impact on society because people who have the desire to acquire knowledge can enjoy sufficient resources without boundaries, which enhances individual's rights to grasp knowledge and facilitates the improvement of higher education in the long run.; In my opinion, this development is generally a positive one. One of the main advantages of such courses is that they increase access to education. For example, one of my friends who lives in the countryside was able to enter a famous university through an Internet course, which would have been out of the question for her in real life. Another advantage is that students can be more flexible. Students from remote regions or people with disabilities can take advantage of a wide range of courses without moving away from home or compromising their health. Students are also able to pace their own learning, which reduces the pressure and stress of the usual classroom. This kind of flexibility is especially important for working people who want to develop their skills or study without interrupting their career. In addition, many Internet courses offer a worldwide community of students and teachers, which can be a valuable resource for developing personal skills and learning about different views. However, there are those who think that these courses cannot provide the personal contact and practical experience of the classroom, and that this can be compensated for with virtual classrooms, virtual laboratories and other interactive tools. The development of technology will probably lead to even better Internet courses that can compete with the quality of a real classroom. In conclusion, the availability of Internet courses is a positive development that has the potential to increase access to education, be flexible and offer a good learning experience.
531;Write about the following topic.The issue of gay marriage remains controversial. Some people think that this trend has adverse effects on the society while others believe that it is seen as a natural trend and right for people to choose this type of marriage. Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Recently, many countries have legalized gay marriage. However, there are many people who do not agree with that, and claim that it has a bad influence on the education of children, and the evolution of society. However, in my opinion, I think it is a good opportunity for homosexual people as they are now understood by others, and have the right to have children despite of their situation.To begin, there are many parents, for example, who tend to believe that because of the access to gay marriage, their children will find it normal to fall in love with a person from the same sex. As a result, more and more children will become homosexual, which is unconventional as far as the parents are concerned. However, I believe that it is not because children understand the fact that being gay is normal, that they will be influenced by this. In fact, they will be able to compassionate for people who struggle to express their homosexuality, so they will help them to feel more comfortable with that. Moreover, they will be more open-minded which is very important for children development.Secondly, many other people are convinced that gay marriage will inevitably tends towards a decrease of the young population as gay individuals can not have their own kids. As a consequence, This phenomenon represents a threat because young people will not be able to take over for the future. However, I am not of this opinion. I think that such a decrease in young people population will not occur as the vast majority of the world's population in not homosexual. Moreover, by allowing gay marriage, gay couples will be able to adopt children. Indeed, due to the fact that they are not able to give rise to new-born, they can adopt children who are abandonned, and give them the opportunity to live in a new family with good conditions.To conclude, I firmly believe that gay marriage is a good opportunity for the development of the society. Indeed, not only it makes children more open-minded, which is important for their own development, but also gives for those who are unfortunately abandonned, a safe environment to thrive in.; According to my view, gay marriage should be legalized because the fundamental human right of a person to choose a life partner should not be influenced by their sexual orientation. In my opinion, gay marriage is a very sensitive and complex issue. Some people strongly oppose this issue, while others support it. In some countries, for example, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia, gay marriage has already been legalized, which has had a positive impact on the well-being and mental health of LGBTI people. However, this view is based on outdated and prejudiced views of the gay community. On the other hand, legalizing gay marriage would promote equality, acceptance and cohesion, which are important for a healthy and progressive society. Legalizing gay marriage would reduce the number of prejudices and allow a more diverse society. In addition, denying the same-gender couples the right to marry is discrimination, which has a negative effect on their mental health and makes it difficult for them to live in society. It is important to recognize that love and commitment do not know any boundaries, and that people should be able to choose their partner without regard to their sexual orientation. To sum up, gay marriage should be legalized because it is a matter of human rights, equality, and personal freedom. It is essential to put love, equality and acceptance before the outdated and prejudiced views of society.
293;Write about the following topic.The most important function of music is that it helps people reduce stress. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many today have come to the conclusion that the most significant effect on people of music is to relieve stress. While I agree that music also has more important positive functions other than reducing stress.On the one hand, I have to admit that music is a good way to reduce stress and it do plays an important role in our daily life. A good example of this can be seen in Shanghai, where has a large number of single karaoke rooms in the office buildings. As we all know, compared to the others cities in China, the people living in Shanghai face more stress, like the surprisingly high price of house and the fierce competition of work. Those public karaoke rooms, which were provided by the government for the public, become a good place for people to enjoy the music and have fun.On the other hand, for many people, music is an ideal career to persue in their life, like the job as an accountant, which can bring them with incomes and improve their living standard. For example, the TV programs related to music attract more and more people to participate in, like The Voice. Most of the participants wish to show their excellent peformance in music through these stages with the purpose of having access to more business opportunities and making more money at the same time. It is undeniable that the following income would be exponential increased than before if they succeed finally.In conclusion, it is not doubt that music is very essential for us, not only for its spiritual meanings, but also for its more important role in our society which could allow the person to relise their dream while creating more economical benefits.; I agree that music can have a significant impact on stress reduction, but I do not agree that this is the most important function of music. Music has a lot of other functions, such as expressing, entertainment and culture, which are equally important. Research has shown that listening to soothing music lowers the cortisol level in the blood, which is a stress hormone, and can lead to a sense of relaxation. But on the other hand, it is difficult to deny that music can significantly reduce stress. Music also has the ability to evoke emotions, create a sense of belonging and challenge the conventions of society. In my personal experience, music has a calming effect when I had to work hard at school, especially when I listened to classical music to study. In conclusion, although music is very important for stress reduction, its importance is not limited to this. Music festivals, concerts and performances have brought people together and have led to the formation of friendships. So I agree partially with the statement that music has a positive impact on reducing stress, but also recognize that it has a deeper and wider impact on human life.
925;Write about the following topic.The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Traffic in cities is now a major public health problem. Finding solutions to reduce traffic is very crucial. I totally agree that if people travel less from home to work or to education or even for shopping can reduce the amount of traffic. With the covid 19 outbreak pandemic we saw how much the working from home and using the zoom application for studying reduced the traffic in cities. People now are using online for shopping too. We know that traffic can be reduced if less consumers are using the roads. However, I dont agree that this is the only way to reduce traffic. Other strategies to reduce traffic are :1. Planning the roads and building the road bridges in a smarter way with special lanes for public transportation.2. Encourging people to use light trails, public transportations and to use car pools.3. Building special lanes for motorcycles and electric bikes.4. The governoment can put more regulations regarding how many cars each family can have.5. Increasing the vehicles prices and reduce the public transportation tickets.6. Educate people on the consequences of traffic and how it can inadverntly affect their life.7. Encourge people to walk more and to choose a work that is close to your home.As I mentioned above there are many strategies that can help in reducing tranffic and only by reducing the need for people to travel from home. I think i people travel less it abviously can reduce the traffic but we need a multi strategy with the collaberations of many sectors to successfly reduce traffic in cities.; On the one hand, reducing the need for travel can reduce traffic significantly. On the other hand, although I agree that reducing the need for travel can reduce traffic, I don't entirely agree that it is the only solution. Tokyo and Singapore have been encouraging people to work from home, and have been making various services available to them through the Internet, which has reduced traffic. For example, the work of the company and its employees is increasingly flexible, and the company also provides an online education platform and an online shopping mall, which will reduce the need to travel. In addition, by improving public transportation, investing in pedestrian and bicycle-friendly roads, and establishing smart traffic systems, it can also reduce traffic significantly. Cities like Copenhagen and Vancouver have successfully implemented these measures, reducing traffic, but not reducing the need to travel. On the other hand, there are also other effective ways to reduce traffic. The most important thing is that it is necessary to improve public transportation, urban planning, and other problems to solve the traffic problem in the city. Moreover, traffic congestion is also a symptom of a large number of other problems, such as urban planning and lack of green space, which also need to be solved. A combination of all these solutions can provide a sustainable, convenient and traffic-free environment for the people of the city.
235;Write about the following topic.There are several factors that motivate people to stay in the workforce, and money is the most important reason/factor. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The topic of motivation for work has merely failed to be discussed. Someone elaborate that the most significant factor is money while others suppose it is not. As far as I am concerned, although money is of great importance, it cannot always be the most valuable one.Undoubtedly, money can be a crucial factor to diminish the financial burden of families, especially for those who were born in a poverty-stricken area. To be more specific, only by earning sufficient money can they raise their later generations and keep the elderly. Provided that they cannot find a decent job that allow them to own some disposable money, it would add insult to injury.However, there are a great number of factors that may be considered as worthwhile to be the motivation of stay in the staff by some people. First of all, being in the workforce can help to strengthen an individual’s interpersonal skills. It is widely acknowledged that there are a colossal number of activities as well as team programmes that require people to collaborate, compromise and compete with the others. Thus, individuals will tend to learn some social skills and become gregarious and sociable, which can help them better adapt themselves to the mainstream society. In addition, people may also get a chance to broaden their horizons and lay a firm basis for future development by staying in the workforce. For instance, under the circumstance that numerous companies may provide the staff with the opportunity to go abroad and get involved in some international programs, people are able to get access to different cultures. As a result, people can develop panning-for-gold thinking rather than sponge-feeding thinking in the process of understanding divergent cultures, which can be beneficial for their future careers.In conclusion, although money is valuable for individuals to be in the workforce, there are many other factors that cannot be overlooked. Only by treating all the factors rationally can we enjoy the pleasure rather than pressure.; In my opinion, there are several other reasons for staying in the workforce besides money. The most important reason for staying in the workforce is being paid, which has been the most debated issue. The man who works for a very low salary may have to work to survive because he has no other alternative for survival. Many people work to survive and earn money, which is a basic human need. For example, a teacher may stay in the workforce because he likes to educate and instill his students, rather than only because of the salary. On the other hand, I believe that personal fulfillment, job satisfaction, and a sense of achievement and recognition are equally important factors. If you stay in the workforce for personal fulfillment, job satisfaction and achievement, you are more likely to stay in the workforce. Similarly, people who work in creative fields may be motivated by the opportunity to express themselves and try to implement their new ideas rather than just for the money. In the end, a combination of financial and non-financial factors motivate people to stay in the workforce, and these two factors determine whether or not an individual stays in the workforce.
115;Write about the following topic.To meet the growing need for food to support an increasing population, a country should make use of edible insects as a food source. However, some people believe that insects are not only unhealthy but harvesting them will also negatively affect nature. What are the benefits and drawbacks of eating insects?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some countries and culture already utilize insects as part of food source. As such, it can be relatively inexpensive to consume insects - which are often freely found in certain environments and do not take much skill to be collected, killed and consumed - as compared to the cost and manual labor involved in raising animal livestock, butchering, as well as preparing the meat for consumption. Similarly agriculture also involves consistent manual labor, and has costs associated with it, including for machinery and materials needed. However, people may be against the idea of consuming insects due to the novelty of it, and they may also feel disgust around it. As the prompt states, some may find it unhealthy. Harvesting insects on purpose will also require some physical and psychological work - but the benefit here is that it may be easier than harvesting large animals or cultivating crops.I have never consumed an insect product - and my father has mentioned to me that had lived in such-and-such country, I would not be so scared of cockroaches - viewing them as a food source. He intended this to be an ironic comment, meant to comfor me somewhat due to my strong aversion to cockroaches. However, he may be correct! For individuals socialized in such a society, their aversion to roaches may be lower than mine. Hence, part of the issue here is socialization and accepting this new food norm, should it be novel to the individual and/or the country.I have tried an octopus for the first time when I was around 20 years old - as I was curious about this dish called Takoyaki, and had heard good reviews of it. It was not unpleasant to eat the ocotpus, per se, but I likely will not go back to it. All in all, new experiences, including consumption of new types of food, may create strong aversion at first, but once dip your toes into it, so to speak, it may be tamer than the experience you were expecting - even if you never go back to eating it again.; Some people are worried about the health and environmental impact of eating insects. However, there are several advantages and disadvantages to eating insects. On the one hand, edible insects are a sustainable and nutritious food source. For example, crickets, mealworms and grasshoppers are rich in protein, vitamins and fiber and are much less demanding of water, land and feed than conventional livestock. In addition, farming edible insects can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help promote sustainable agriculture. On the other hand, there are also disadvantages. One kilogram of beef needs up to 1,000 liters of water to produce, but a kilogram of crickets only needs one liter. In addition, the over-exploitation of natural insects can affect the pollination and decomposition process. Some people also believe that insects can contain harmful bacteria, fungi and other chemicals that are harmful to human health. In conclusion, although there are some health and environment concerns about eating insects, it is inevitable to ignore the benefits of eating insects. It is the responsibility of governments, research institutes and farmers to establish a safe and environmentally friendly production process for insects. Farming edible insects is one way to meet the growing demand for food, and promoting sustainable agriculture and reducing the human footprint.
131;Write about the following topic.With the improvements in today’s health care, society has to care for more and more elderly people.Do you feel that society will be able to cope with the increase in numbers of elderly people today and how can it be managed?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;I believe that all improvements in health care increase the number of elderly people, but those improvements also brings benefities in an way to care then.First of all, looking for a financial perspective, in generaly way, people became capable to work for a bigger period, getting retired older. So they could contributed more for any pension plan or those kind of program. We need to guarantee that our next governants will be capable to redesign the retire's program in an way to guarantee those beneffits to whole population.Looking by a health care perspective, all the improvments and medicine advance, it brings the possibilite to have a good life even allthough the years.For instance, we can see many people that healed from a bad ill like cancer or other ones and have a good life nowadays.This is the reason that elderly people is not a problem to our society, but in fact their represents more knowledge and we have all tecnology to take care about theirselfs.In other way we can see that our society open more space and are more concern with elderly population. We can see some places speciallyzed to take care of their and also a kind of intertainement focused on them, like some hotels, restauurants, clinics.In whole way our society are looking for treaty our elderly society in a decent way, respect them, make a enviroment friendly for their deficient and any dificult of mobility and any other issue that we need to cope to guarantee their activities.; In my opinion, society will be able to cope with the increase in the number of the elderly, but it requires careful planning, management and allocation of resources. Advances in medicine and a longer life have increased the number of the elderly population and now there is a problem to deal with the care of elderly people. There are many reasons for this, and as more and more people grow old, government and health care must be prepared to meet the challenge. One of the most pressing issues is the high cost of caring for the elderly. In my opinion, it is also important to change attitudes towards aging and the care of the elderly. By promoting the participation of the young in community and volunteer work, the Japanese have demonstrated a sense of compassion and responsibility towards the elderly. Other countries can learn from Japan and also develop strategies for dealing with financial and logistics problems for the care of the elderly. It is my belief that society will cope with the increase in the elderly population, but it requires a variety of approaches. In many communities, for example, young people are invited to befriend the elderly in the community, helping them in the community and providing emotional support and practical help. Such a program not only benefits the elderly, but also enriches the lives of young people. We can learn from Japan and other countries and develop new ways of dealing with the elderly in society. For example, by developing community and social participation and by promoting the care and welfare of the elderly.
933;Write about the following topic.Young people in the modern world seem to have more power and influence than any previous young generation.Why is this the case?What impact does this have on the relationship between old and young people?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"In modern times, the younger generation appear to be more powerful and influencial compared to the generations in times past. I believe this is as a result of younger people being more ascertive, stepping up to question and change existing societal norms and archaic cultures. At first, this may negatively affect their relationship with the older generation as a result of how unfamiliar they are to these changes but subsequently, the tension is bound to resolve, when the older generations come to accept these changes.To begin with, it is an open truth that young people these days tend to be very bold and outspoken and unlike their predecessors, are better at questioning norms that do not sit right with them and even going an extra mile to change these norms or cultures. A good example of this is seen in women empowerment and rights activism. In my part of the world, some years back, it was believed that a woman's place is in the kitchen and her sole job was to birth and rear children, therefore, women were not allowed to be educated or have paying jobs. Women in the older generation complied to this because it was the norm, but this is not the case in modern times, because many young women opposed to it and now, homes are even headed by women; the power of activism.Many people in the older generation are not familiar with young people being more outspoken and this is understandable because in their time, they were taught to only follow rules and not to question them. Therefore the fact that young people have become more outspoken and powerful is foreign to them and just like every human nature, whatever is foreign or different is automatically hated. As a result, there is likely going to be a tension between the 2 generations, however, with constant advocation and learning the tension is bound to resolve. For example, going back to women's rights activism, at the start, many older people were not on board as they did not think it was normal, however, there are now a lot of older people who have become activists.In conclusion, I believe that the power and influence the younger generation has is as a result of their ascertiveness and will to effect changes in their societies and even though it may cause a negative relationship with the older generation at first, subsequently, their differences is likely to be ironed out when the older generation learns to accept these changes."; Social media and the Internet have played a major role in this. These media give young people a voice and a place to express themselves and reach out to people all over the world. The relationship between young people and older people has changed. With the changing nature of work and education, young people can now pursue their own goals and interests without having to follow a predetermined path. They can now form a network, gather support, and promote issues that are important to them. And this has had a variety of impacts on the relationship between young and old. On the one hand, the intergenerational gap has narrowed because young people’s ideas and perspectives are welcomed by older generations. With this freedom, young people have been able to invent and lead in a variety of fields, from technology and art to politics and social change. Young people are now working in companies and for governments, promoting their own ideas and opinions. But on the other hand, some older people feel threatened by the increasing influence of younger people, and may not understand the way they think and the language they use. The younger and older generations can work together to take advantage of this new situation. But this requires effort and openness from both sides.
351;Write about the following topic:In many countries, not enough students study science subjects. What are the causes? What will be the effect on society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, there are many courses available to take, from arts that include theatre and music to scientific topics such as mathemathics, physics, chemistry, biology and medicine. There is an evidence that the amount of students willing to learn science subjects is not sufficient. In this essay I will discuss the causes of the issue and the possible effect on society.There are several casues for the fact that students tend to skip science subjects. First, studying science can be hard and exhausting. The complexity of some subjects such as math and physics requires from the student to study many hours at home. Secondly, there are students who do not only find those courses difficult, but also get low marks even after studying long hours. As for chemistry classes, some courses include labratory lessons which may not appeal to some students.The importance of people having knowledge in science is great. The society relies on science on a daily basis. For instance, doctors who study medicine, must know mathematics, biology and chemistry well, because biology is relevant to the patient's body. In addition, doctors prescribe medications so they must know chemistry well. Another example is architects whose job is to plan and design buildings. Without a proper knowledge in physics, they could not plan buildings.Discussing those facts, studying science can be challenging. However, it is vital for the society that students will study science. Without doctors, nurses, scientists and other professions that rely on science, the health of the society might be effected negatively.; Among the causes of this trend is the difficulty of science subjects, which discourages many students from choosing these subjects. Lack of qualified and inspiring teachers in these areas may also deter them from taking up these subjects. Besides, the teaching of science subjects is often too theoretical and not experimental enough, which reduces interest and innovation. The resulting lack of science graduates can lead to a lack of skills in fields such as medicine, technology and engineering, which are important for innovation and economic growth. If this trend continues, society will suffer from a lack of critical skills and lose its competitiveness, leading to a lack of economic growth and prosperity. In contrast, countries that are weak in science education will find it difficult to compete in a rapidly changing world. Science education needs to be made more interesting and relevant to everyday life by including more practical and project-based learning, and by bringing in experts from the science fields. The aim should be to inspire and develop the next generation of scientists, innovators and leaders who are able to solve the complex problems of the 21st century.
1185;Write about the following topic:Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Poverty has been always a major issue around the world. Due to viruses, natural disasters, and poor management in the country and overpopulation, each day the poverty increases. In addition, some developed countries ignore the help or just give a temporary solution. Poverty has a great effect on the income that can lead to serious problems.To begin with, developed countries shouldn't only support with financial aid, as that kind of solution will not help the people. In my opinion, rich countries can stop poverty in such way to look for the natural resources of the poor country and to help and develop its resources. For example, in Africa they are famous for their large area of land. A rich country can take this opportunity to implement a long-term plan to benefit and fight poverty, such as to start expanding the lands of agriculture to use their natural resources such as cocoa, rice, and coffee. Furthermore, this idea can also help the people of the country where they can work on the land and be employed.Also, developed countries can donate and build health care centers and schools to prevent the dangerous disease from spreading. Schools can empower children to grow up and help the country's economy to rise and to fight poverty.In conclusion, developed countries can unite and discuss this significant concern rather than helping with financial support as poverty is taking the lives of many children. Poor countries just need better solutions and understanding from the world to prevent such problems from continuing to happen.; On the one hand, financial aid has many disadvantages. Although I agree that monetary aid alone cannot solve poverty, I still believe that it can be an important part of a comprehensive development strategy. For example, in some African countries, the imported food subsidy has suppressed local farmers and made it more difficult for them to compete in the market. For example, foreign aid can create dependence, destroy the economy, and even be misused by corrupt governments. On the other hand, financial aid can be a lifeline for countries suffering from poverty, war or natural disasters, helping to stabilize the economy and supporting public services such as health and education. Therefore, other forms of aid such as technical support, education and infrastructure should be considered. I agree that financial aid should not be excluded completely, but I don't think so. After the Haiti earthquake in 2010, financial aid from developed countries helped to provide immediate relief and helped to support reconstruction. Under such circumstances, financial aid can be an important stopgap that can prevent the humanitarian crisis from becoming a real crisis. In short, the most effective form of aid depends on the context and needs of each country, and a flexible, comprehensive approach is needed to solve the complex problems of global poverty. I think the most effective way is to combine financial assistance with technical assistance, build human resources and strengthen the ability to solve problems.
343;Write about the following topic:Some people believe that it is important to spend a lot of money on family celebrations. While others think it is a waste of money. Discuss both views.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Spending money in family celebrations can be seen as a way of appreciating where one comes from. Although some people say it is a total waste of money, l assert that it is wiser.To begin with, many people feel that it is of no importance to consume money on family gatherings. This is because people usually have more pressing issues in life like urgent health cases that require money. Also, some struggle to provide basic needs for their families, for example, tuitions, decent meals and shelter. For these reasons, it seems using money on family gatherings is just a luxury.Despite the merits of the arguments above, although many say it is wasteful to financially cater for family parties, l assert that it is crucial. One reason is that, it unites families and a sweet spirit is maintained if family members are recognised for their special days such as wedding anniversaries, birthdays and graduations where money is spent. Further, appreciation to others within the family cannot be expressed in many ways without forking out some money.Furthermore, money has to be spent on family get togethers where everyone is in a joyous mood so that people can catch up and release stresses from their straining personal lives. What is more, culture, closeness and love is easily displayed when families come together for such celebrations and use money for their own satisfaction. For instance, when my childhood birthdays were celebrated, l felt so much loved and l still cherish the memories as l vividly can recall.To conclude, although others feel that it is money consuming to fund family gatherings, l advocate that it is a wiser option. Should this be the case, love within families would not wax cold and family members would feel more appreciated.; On the one hand, people think that celebrations with relatives and friends should be a way to create unforgettable memories and strengthen family bonds. For example, an expensive wedding or a party celebrating a special birthday is a unique event that can bring people together, create a joyful and memorable experience and a good reason for closeness and fellowship. The question of whether it is necessary to spend a lot of money on family celebrations has always been a controversial issue. On the other hand, others believe that spending a lot of money on family celebrations is a waste of money. The same money can be saved for a child's education or the down payment on a house. On the other hand, extravagant gifts and lavish decorations will add to the atmosphere of the holiday and make it more special. In my opinion, both views are reasonable, and whether to spend a lot on family celebrations depends on individual circumstances and priorities. On the other hand, some people are under a lot of pressure to spend more than they can afford, and this can lead to financial problems and even debts. A combination of emotional satisfaction and financial well-being will help people make memorable and enjoyable celebrations without causing financial problems. What is important is the connection between people and their love, not the price of the celebration.
1199;Write about the following topic:Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Is competition instructive or toxic for children? There is a debate around this topic. There are those who believe that a sense of competition should be supported. On the other standpoint, there are those who believe that rather that compete children have to learn how to co-operate. I believe that supporters of competicions are partly right but also that co-operation between children is essential. The two strategy can be taken together to give to childrens all the tools they need to became useful adults.On the one hand, there are people who believe that to compete is essential for the growth of children. They believe that competitions rise the ambitions of children. They develop certain attitudes thanks to which they will have always bigger dreams and desire. The idea, therefore, is that children who have grown making competiions will became important managers because of their instinctive desire to be winners and successful persons. It is true that competitions permit childrens to develop their ambitions and to do the best they can in order to win. However, I strongly believe that a good understanding of the aim of competitions should be taught before they start to compete. Indeed, children have to understand the instructive role of competition and how manage the possible distructive consequences that could derive if a child is not ready to lose. Children should start a competition being aware of the possibility of lose and the possibility to win. I believe that is important to stimulate children in doing competitions but teaching them the important role of defeats and the role of coperation. This lead me to analyse the second standpoint.There are, indeed, people who dislike competitions at all. They believe they are toxic for the growth of children. According to them, it is negative to teach children to be against between each other. Rather, children should learn how to work together and co-operate. Surely, co-operation is a vital skill in workplaces. The ability to work in team is one of the most searched by different businesses. To learn how to work together means for children to understand their role in a group and also to think about the ideas that should support the team itself. Co-operation then permits children to develop fundamental social skills. However, co-operation alone is not enough for children's instruction. I believe that co-operation is possible just if a child is also learning how to work and produce something alone. Children, in order to advances ideas and give a good support in a team, have to learn to be ambitious and this is possible thanks to competitions.In conclusion, I believe that an instruction in which single competitions as well as team-works are encouraged is the most useful and productive in order to grow up efficient adults.; On the one hand, some people think that competition in children is good for their development, because competition stimulates children to do more, to achieve more and to be more ambitious. This argument is still valid and there is a big debate about the importance of competition and co-operation for children. On the other hand, some people think that teaching children to work together instead of competing is better for them. For example, schools that encourage competition in sports and in the sciences generally produce more active and successful people who later succeed in life. Competition is the basis of the life of all people, and therefore they are still active and successful. On the other hand, co-operation teaches people the value of mutual support, values, social and behavioural skills, which are necessary for achieving common goals and relationships. Children who work together to achieve common goals learn to understand each other's weaknesses and strengths, develop empathy and mutual understanding. On the one hand, competition is the driving force that motivates children to do more, but too much competition can lead to depression, stress and the development of the desire to achieve individual success rather than collective success. On the other hand, co-operation teaches children to work together, but it is less conducive to the development of teamwork and social skills. In my opinion, co-operation and competition should be combined. This combination of elements will enable children to develop teamwork, leadership and social skills, which will later help them become useful and well-developed adults.
397;Write about the following topic:Some people think that hosting an international sports event is good for the country, while some people think it is bad. Discuss both views and state your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;International sports events are one of the most trendy interactions at any hosting country. Depending on the hoster, the events could represent a virtue or a slip. This dependence is associated with the costs, logisitcs, marketing, etc. I tend to be of the opinion, that the virtues outweigh the disadvantages and that they shall be considered as opportunities to exploit.Some people think of the international sport events as being disadvantageous, because for example of being a pressure on the countries' infrastructure as well as the provided services and facilities. Another reason might emerge as some countries also might not be well-suited for such events. For instance, despite spending a big budget on the organisation of the event, the lack of qualified personnel or needed objects and materials shall cause a massive distruction of the hostees' experiences.The other perpective of the usages and utilization of such events could be clear through the massive amount of virtues, which these events normally brings to the hosting countries. For example, these events are regularly sponsored from international organisation, which provide the financial means not for only the logisitcs of the events, but additionally fees for the hosters. Furthermore, the financial benefits shall not stop by the provided fees through the owning organisation, but also the global or regional branding of such country will affect the tourism and the local service providers absolutely positive.Concluding, international sport events could be absolutely virtous, if the hosting countries were to implement their strategies successfully. Should such countries be willing to give the event the raw focus on the organisation and the user-experience, that would absolutely lead to massive benefits financially, marketing-wise and from intercultural perspective.; On the one hand, people believe that hosting an international sports event can be very beneficial for a country. For example, it can help to increase the country's economy by creating more jobs and stimulating the growth of tourism. The Olympic games in Beijing in 2008 and the Olympic games in London in 2012 are examples of how a country's economy can be enriched by hosting an international sports event and put the country on the world map. Besides, the influx of people and the media will also make the country's culture, history and natural environment more well-known and thereby attract more foreign investors and tourists. On the other hand, some people also think that hosting an international sports event can have negative effects on a country. For example, the 2014 World Cup in Brazil was a cause for protest because the country's finances were channeled to the World Cup instead of addressing the country's economic and social problems. Building and maintaining modern sports facilities, such as stadiums and training grounds, costs a lot of money and takes up a lot of space. In addition, the country must also build roads and public transport in order to meet the demand for the event, which will have long-term benefits for the country's development. In my opinion, hosting an international sports event is a good thing if it is carefully managed. In the end, it is a good way for a country to develop and grow. However, it is important for the host country to pay attention to the needs of its own people so that the event does not come at the expense of their well-being.
1412;You can get up-to-date news from the radio, TV and the Internet. Which kind of media do you think is the best to get the news?;Nowadays, there are several channels to get news, such as the radio, TV, newspapers and the Internet. I think the Internet is the best among these. .Since its invention, the Internet has been booming as a prospective industry. Not only because it is a combination of text, audio and video, but also due to its . It has threatened the domination of spreading news of the traditional media, and, I would say, is about to take control.We can find everything we want on the Internet – the latest news, books, songs, movies, cartoons… . With the radio, we can merely hear. Compared to a newspaper, the radio and TV can provide the latest information. For instance the breaking news of the Americans’ attacking Iraq was immediately online, as well as that the Twin Towers of New York were destroyed on September 11, 2001. However, we just cannot .The Internet is a way of getting information, as long as your mobile phone is connected or you possess a laptop. When I am a vehicle, I usually have my cellphone connected to the Internet, then browse through what in the past few hours, or log in MSN to begin a conversation with my friends. Reading a newspaper is also a good way to kill time, but for me, a youngster, it is not so modern as “surfing online while commuting”.The traditional media will never disappear, though the Internet has taken a big advantage the competition. And definitely, there is still a long way for the Internet to go. , the Internet benefits me the most, and I highly appreciate it.; The advantage of each is obvious, but I think the Internet is the most obvious and the most enduring medium. The modern world has developed technology and made many ways of getting the news at our fingertips. The most popular ways of getting the news are the radio, the Internet and the TV. The first advantage of the Internet is its ease of use. We only have to click on a few news sites, blogs, or social media to find out about the news. In the fast-paced world we live in, it is very important to keep up with the news. The Internet not only gives us a variety of news sources, but also has an unlimited number of sources, so it is convenient to compare the news and find the truth. Compared to the radio and the television, which have a fixed schedule and limited coverage, the Internet can be used any time and anywhere. The second advantage of the Internet is that it is an interactive medium. When you read the news, you can leave comments on the page, and you can discuss and discuss with other people on the social network, which makes people feel closer to each other and more interested in the news. On the other hand, the news on the radio and the news on the television are often very brief and superficial, so they are not so rich in details as the Internet. In my opinion, although the radio and the television are also good news media, they are not as convenient and varied as the Internet. Moreover, the Internet is a medium that has been developed with technology, so it will definitely be the best way to get the news in the future.
1377;should children grow up in the city or countryside (advantages/disadvantages)?;Some people think it is better for children to grown up in the city, while others think that life in the countryside is more suitable for them. What are the advantages and disadvantages of both places?Living in the rural area is the best option for children by a group of people, while others believe that cities offer more opportunities. In my opinion, if the city offers security and green areas, I agree it is a better place to raise the next generation some advantages both sides.Firstly, the countryside in touch with nature, taking care of animals and helping with the gardening. Because of that, they learn how to protect the environment and to live without any technological equipment. Besides that, they have more freedom to play outside the house without any security worries, whereas in the city they are kept at home smartphones and computers for this reason. On the other hand, schools usually have lower quality and it is hard to find extracurricular classes. Therefore, children difficulties trying to develop their abilities besides the school curriculum.However, schools at metropolitan areas tend to have better quality and offer all kinds of activities. Even if there is a sport or an art course that the institution does not offer, it is possible to look for it in another place around the city. As a result, all children’s talents and passions can be easier to develop. On the other hand, security, pollution and contact with nature are issues that we have to worry about. The better option would be a city with an excellent quality of life where children could play in parks and gardens.To sum up, growing up in the countryside can be very positive for someone’s childhood, but the city will usually offer better opportunities for their talents’ development.This is a well written essay. It talks about all parts of the task and the arguments and ideas are extended and supported by some examples. The information is sequenced in a logical way and most of the ideas are linked using appropriate connective words. The choice of vocabulary is suitable to express the meaning of the writer, though in some instances word choice can be improved further (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows suggested corrections). Most sentences are error-free and demonstrate various levels of complexity. Overall this essay seems good enough to deserve IELTS Band 8.; The benefits of city life are mainly in the convenience of the city. The disadvantages are the dangers of city life. You can also get better health care in the city and better schools. Cities also offer a lot of education and entertainment, such as museums, libraries, theaters, and children in the city are exposed to many different cultures, food and life styles, which helps to cultivate their own openness and tolerance. The benefits of the countryside are: quiet and peaceful, away from city noise and pollution, there is more space for children to play, and people are closer to nature, so they are healthier. There are also disadvantages. Cities are too crowded, too noisy, and too dirty, which can seriously affect children's physical and mental health. Besides, in the countryside, people often have a closer relationship with their neighbors, and the children are more comfortable in their environment. However, in the countryside, there are fewer conveniences and opportunities, and the children are isolated, so their development is difficult. Finally, whether children should grow up in the city or in the countryside depends on individual preferences. There are advantages and disadvantages to both city and country life, but the ideal is to have a balanced diet and a more complete environment.
1379;should unpaid community work be mandatory in high school (agree/disagree)?;"Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programs (for example working for a charity, improving the neighborhood or teaching sports to younger children). To what extent do you agree or disagree?It is argued that voluntary services charity, cleaning the neighborhood, imparting knowledge to the underprivileged, should be made mandatory in the high school curriculum. I strongly agree as it not only helps in students becoming socially responsible adults but also in shaping their character.Firstly, community service inculcates a sense of responsibility towards the society, something that is needed to shape a good society. For instance, the introduction of Swatch Bharath scheme in my school, The Hyderabad Public School, ten years ago taught me not only to keep the surroundings of the school clean but also to never litter wherever I go. Hence, now I feel responsible to maintain cleanliness everywhere. Such services are needed to develop a better society in the future.Secondly, voluntary services cater to the overall character development of an individual. It a feeling of empathy in children which is needed to build a better character. For example, an alumnus of Montessori High School, who indulged in petty law-breaking activities during school confessed that it was the charity service that he did in high school; which in his mind; him in becoming a better person for his family and refrained him from committing socially irresponsible acts. Thus, such voluntary activities teach us to value what we have and in turn to our personality development.That being said, we cannot deny the fact that many students misuse the time allocated for these services by considering it as an excursion to enjoy with friends rather than a learning .In conclusion, although compulsory voluntary community service has its drawbacks, it is still useful in shaping a child as a socially responsible citizen and also in their overall personality development. Therefore, pupils should be encouraged to involve themselves in such activities.This is a well written essay. It addresses all parts of the task and the arguments and ideas are developed and supported. The information is presented in a logical order and the ideas are linked by appropriate connective words. The use of vocabulary conveys the exact meaning of the writer and there are only minor instances of a word being used somewhat unnaturally. Sentence formation demonstrates a high level of control and very few errors (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows suggested corrections). Overall this essay seems good enough for IELTS Band 8 level."; I strongly agree with mandatory community service in high school. High school students who are required to do community service develop a sense of civic responsibility and acquire life skills that cannot be learned in the classroom. Furthermore, community service can open students’ eyes to the many career possibilities in areas such as social work, medicine, and the environment that they might not have otherwise considered. Such experiences help them become more mature, contributing members of society. Their future careers will benefit as well as their personal lives, as they will learn how to work more cooperatively with others and solve problems. It is useful not only for their future careers but also for their personal lives, as they will be better able to handle the stresses of life. Even a small requirement, such as twenty hours per semester, would be a great help. Opponents argue that students are too busy to do community service. However, the benefits far outweigh the costs. Students will be able to manage their time effectively to meet both their school and community obligations. In conclusion, making community service mandatory in high school is a progressive approach to education. In combining community service with high school education, we are not only preparing better students but also better citizens.
917;‘Failure is proof that the desire wasn’t strong enough’To what extent do you agree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Failure is what nobody wish for, but it could occur secondarily to an unsuccessful attempt towards ones goal, for various reasons. I am in the view that, failure is not a proof of lack of desire, rather it is more to do with improper techniques, less allocation of time and lack of proper attitude.It is the general view that, ultimate success in any field is taught through the failures in life. One can be subjected to multiple failures due to lack of ability to develop essential skill set, also known as techniques, that would be essential to achieve a certain goal. One classic example is Thomas Alwa Eddison, the great inventor of all time, who went through nearly 100 unsucessfull experiments, before inventing the light bulb. He was brave enough to accept the failure experiments had taught him 100 different impossible ways not to discover the light bulb.On the other hand, time plays one of the most crucial factors in obtaining a goal/success. By this I meant, the time that is allocated towards full filling tasks that are directed towards preparing for the goal. The little time is spent during the preparation, the further away the goal felt like. For an instance, one cannot expected to win a marothon with just one day preparation.Similarly, attitude plays by far the most striking part of the success. This is simple as, one cannot dream of becoming a good physician, having shown no interest in paying attention to people and their health related complaints.In a nut shell, failure is not a proof for inadequate desire in fact, failure is due to improper practices of techniques,failure of managing time in preparing and attitudes that fires the drive.; I understand the motivation behind this statement, but I don’t agree with it completely. The relationship between desire and success, in my opinion, is more complex. Firstly, strong desire often motivates people to work a lot to achieve their goals, and despite numerous failures they can achieve their goals. The most obvious example of this is Thomas Edison, whose work on the light bulb is a vivid illustration of the power of desire. On the other hand, failure can be caused by various external factors, such as the lack of available resources, inadequate training or even just bad luck. For example, a student may be very willing to excel in a particular subject, but he can’t because of poor teaching methods or personal circumstances. In this case, he may have a very strong desire to achieve, but his goals have been achieved because of his external circumstances. Failure can also be a useful learning experience and not always a sign of insufficient desire. Many successful people such as J.K. Rowling and Stephen King have spoken of how their early failures contributed to their later success. In such cases, it is unfair to say that the desire was not enough. Finally, although a strong desire to succeed is undoubtedly important, failure does not necessarily mean the desire is insufficient. Other external circumstances, guidance and good fortune also play an important role in success. Therefore, it is important to view failure in a positive way, both as a sign of insufficient desire and as a useful learning experience.
1419;“Some people say that the education system is the only critical factor to development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?”;Education plays a vital role in the development of a country. Therefore, some people think that the education system is the only important factor to the development of a country and they may be right.Education is the foundation of developed society. It is rightly said, ‘education is a ladder success’. If all the people of any country are educated then they becomes broadminded, civilized and progressive. An educated society improves the standard of life as well., education also creates a good employment opportunity and therefore country does not have to suffer from big problems like unemployment. Educated peoples are more aware of such as pollution and many more. A country becomes technologically advanced because of educated people.Not only this, but also by giving importance to education, the nations can get rid of problems like , poverty, unemployment and population growth that delay the progress of a nation. The crime rate can also be kept under . The standard of living of the people will go up. If the nations to be progressive it is very important that the people are more educated and progressive. Any country can become more technologically advanced and developed because of education.However, there are other factors that also play an important role in the development of a country. Such as governments have to encouraged people to do soIn conclusion, I would like to say that a good education system will lead to a developed country.; On the one hand, education plays a key role in shaping the future of a nation. However, I disagree that education is the only critical factor to the development of a country. This is because education is a very broad subject that involves many things. On the one hand, an educated population is more likely to participate in the labor market, participate in social activities and live a healthy life. On the other hand, education is a multiplier, because it gives people the ability to make rational decisions and work for a better life. For example, a developed transport system facilitates the movement of goods and people, and this also contributes to the growth of the economy. On the other hand, there are many other factors that are essential to the development of a country, such as development, public administration, and economic policy. The success or failure of a country depends on the performance of these factors. The functioning of the administration and the economy, in particular, the fiscal policy of the government, also play an important role in the development of a country. Also, a country cannot be developed on the basis of one thing. Various factors need to be taken into account to achieve a well-rounded development.
