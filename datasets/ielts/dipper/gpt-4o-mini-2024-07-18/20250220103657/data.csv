1095;A country becomes more interesting and develops more quickly when its population includes a mixture of nationalities.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is belived that countries are developing faster and become more inspiring when their populations consist of variety of people with different nationalities. In my opinion, it is very controversial question, but I believe that nations who are tolerant to others and friendly are able to succeed in constracting better world not only for themselves and their surroundings but also for future generations. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view about attractiveness and development of countries based on national diversity.On the one hand, people of different nationalities are hardly able to understand each other and can be impatient for people who have another nationalities, that can create difficulties in communication, making agreements, sovling of problems. For example, people with different backgrounds can strat arguing about better governmental constitutions and politics, religions, educational system, traditional and another types of medicine, and so on. It worths to mention that none of those people will be completely right, if they deside to show off their experience instead of accepting ideas of others and just giving advice. Moreover, some disputes can even lead to quarrels, but not to finding the better dessisions, that can influence on safety of people with different nationalities. So, for living peacefully and sharing some ideas of better developmental practice, people should first of all respect each other independantly of their nantionalities.On the other hand, people of various nationalities are able to create not only interesting and diverse community, but also share knowlege and experience in order to achieve the best results in countries' development. For achieving this, people should follow several basic rules, which are usually unwritten, but those mental and behavioral lows should be understood by everyone. Firstly, they should be tolerant to each other and accepting some differences. Secondly, they should be polite when they want to share their knowlege and experiences, not showing off. Thirdly, it would be wonderful if they are able to create international community where people can communicate and make friends. Last but not least, they should remember that their attitudes for each other influence on the world as a whole where they and their children live, so they should be responsible for their words and behavior.In conclusion, countries which managed to connect people of different nationalities and create a friendly surroundings, in my opinion, are able to develope faster and look like fascinating diverse community which consist of people of various backgrounds.; To begin with, a mixed population fosters cultural exchange and innovation. In fact, national diversity enriches a nation in a number of ways, influencing its culture, economy and general development. Such cities as New York and London, with their cultural melting-pots, have created iconic cuisines, such as fusion cuisine, and numerous artistic movements, which are constantly evolving. When different nationalities live side by side, they bring with them their unique traditions, languages and art, which contribute to a richer cultural tapestry. As a result, the variety of influences leads to innovations in many fields, including food, fashion and entertainment. To this can be added an increased productivity in the workforce, resulting from a variety of perspectives and problem-solving methods. Such cultural vibrancy not only enriches the life of its inhabitants but also attracts tourists, boosting the economy. From the standpoint of the economy, it is inextricably linked to innovation and entrepreneurship, which in turn spur economic growth and job creation. It is this dynamic that has enabled Singapore to forge a resilient economy, able to adapt to the constantly changing world. In sum, I strongly agree that the presence of a variety of nationalities makes for a more interesting and dynamic country. However, it is important to bear in mind that a mixed population also brings with it certain challenges, including integration issues and societal tensions. However, if the country manages to integrate its different nationalities through effective policies that encourage mutual respect and tolerance, the benefits far outweigh the downsides. An integrated nation can benefit from a rich cultural life and an enhanced economy that is able to compete in a world that is becoming ever more globalized.
1374;Advertising affects what people think is important and has a negative effect on their lives (agree/disagree);Today people are surrounded by advertising. This affects what people think is important and has a negative impact on people’s lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?With the advent of the Internet, advertisements, originally displayed only on TV, billboards, posters and so on, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and commonplace for the general public. In my view, this kind of impact could be both crucial and, on a certain level, detrimental.On the one hand, this phenomenon could denote that although we have already had a diverse range of , people are still capable of inventing innovative approaches catering for all kinds of requirements of advertising. It is a symbol that demonstrates the creativity rooted in human beings. Apart from that, it also represents that the speed of spreading information is conspicuously escalating. More purposeful is, therefore, the fact that, besides booming of the advertising, it constitutes a major reason why people could be so prosperous in this digital age.On the other hand, there are various unpleasant consequences as well. Firstly, with the omnipresent , it could potentially cause people to do impulsive shopping. Secondly, the , if regulated in a mismanaged , could make people constantly feel uncomfortable or annoyed. In this sense, instead of being an instrumental tool to promote amenities, advertisements could be considered a hindrance when people are frequently blocked by them. Furthermore, it would cost one precious time to have to sift the helpful ad from a host of others.In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, advertising is a beneficial phenomenon for all with a number of insignificant drawbacks. I believe that in the future we can improve the way advertising is done at present, and embrace the positive influence of advertising even further in the long run.This essay is another example of what Band 8 writing may look like. It’s weak point is that the author goes slightly off-topic while trying to discuss whether advertising affects what people view as important and instead talks about the reason advertising is spreading and about human creativity. However, the other part of task type (negative effects of advertising) is covered well, the ideas are well-developed and supported. There is a clear logical flow of information and a range of transitional words is used appropriately to sequence ideas. The way author uses synonyms to rephrase the task topic in the intro paragraph demonstrates their lexical skill, which is also evident in other parts of this essay. There are many complex sentences and very few errors. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.0.; One of the most significant ways that advertising affects us is that it creates a very unrealistic concept of beauty, success and happiness. By promoting the products, not only the products themselves, but also lifestyles, values and goals, advertising makes a framework where consumers are in a higher position than the real needs of people. Instead of encouraging people to be more authentic and to be themselves, advertising often puts pressure on people to become more perfect. In fact, the use of digitally distorted images in fashion and beauty advertisements may distort our image of beauty and physical appearance, which can lead to a culture of dissatisfaction. Comparisons between individuals and this fabricated reality lead to feelings of inadequacy, depression and despair. But it's not just physical appearance that is affected. The pursuit of consuming goods can also result in a lack of interest in relationships, emotional well-being and social relationships. In this way, the advertising industry plays a very important role in shaping the concept of what we consider to be important. And the everyday, all-pervasive nature of advertising makes it difficult for people to escape its influence. From social media to roadside billboards, the incessant bombardment of images creates an environment where consumption is normalized and encouraged, and people can easily become caught in the trap of buying and buying, which sometimes leads to financial difficulties. These effects are quite harmful to our priorities and self-esteem, and we need to take a critical view of the advertising that permeates our lives. In conclusion, although advertising can inform consumers and recommend some beneficial products, its overall influence often tilts society towards materialism and superficiality.
1395;Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone’s life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is a negative one. Discuss both views and include your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. You should write at least 250 words.;Many people wonder about . Some people think that it has negative impact in our life. However, positive effect on this world.? Of Course for several reasons: firstly, it motivates the psychological point in everyone, and women in particular. They will run to buy this advertised product especially if it’s from , just to show their beauty to men, which may lead to negative effects of too much sexual attention. Secondly, you can sit comfortably with your family and suddenly the telephone is ringing, but it’s nothing important, it’s just another company to convince you to buy one of their products. It is a real . Lastly, sometimes you do not have the financial ability to buy something, but with these new methods of advertisement, you run to buy it, which affect your budget.On the other hand, there are some good sides to advertising. For instance, it compares the prices of many companies which the consumer. Besides, it really see more products which we unless the TV or Radio advertised them. , it breaks our daily routine and allows us to see new faces and learn the language better with the help of the daily updates they deliver through .In conclusion, as we can see there are many aspects to this . I feel that we gain no benefits at all from advertisement, it plays buy more things that they do not need it at all.; For example, the advocates of advertising argue that it is a necessary part of the economy. On the other hand, critics of advertising claim that it makes us greedy. Advertisements for the latest technology, for example, show us not only what the product does but also what its competitors do. For companies, advertising is a useful way to create brand awareness and inform consumers about new products and services. In this way, transparency can promote innovation and progress. Moreover, the advertising industry supports many kinds of creative industries, creating jobs and promoting economic growth. But on the other hand, it can also lead to consumerism and the pursuit of material possessions that do not necessarily bring happiness. In particular, beauty ads often show unrealistic beauty standards, which can lead to negative body images in young people. It is my view that although advertising has its positive side, there is no doubt that it has a negative side. This demonstrates the need for responsible and ethical advertising that puts the interests of consumers and the environment first. This consumerism can lead to a throwaway culture. By finding the right balance between informative and ethical advertising, we can exploit its potential without succumbing to its downsides. Moreover, advertising should not only sell products but also convey positive social messages.
845;Boxing is a blood sport which often results in physical injury. It is inappropriate for this sport to exist in the modern age.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;There is debatable issue as to whether boxing, a seemingly bloody sport, should be excluded from the modern society. As far as I am concerned, the attempt to remove boxing from the current age is utterly unjustified.Admittedly, boxing is often associated with various disturbing factors, such as foul language, disregard to rivals, violent punches and inelegant appearance as a result of intense physical contacts. However, such gory scenes may frequently take place in underground boxing games which are barely recognised by the professional community of boxing and by the legal system. Unlike underground boxing, professional boxing upholds moral principles and universal values, for examples, respect to opponents, obedience of rules, etc. Also, professional boxers are protected by safety equipment and judges who may stop the game when witnessing any player suffering serious injuries. Therefore, the health hazards involved in boxing games may not be as severe as the public assumes.Another reason reinforcing my position is that boxing already enjoys considerable popularity around the world and plays an important part in people's entertainment, as exemplified by the successful ticket sales of most boxing games and high audience rating of TV programmes broadcasting boxing matches. Given such popularity of boxing, the removal of this sport may cause widespread dissatisfaction and complaint.To draw a conclusion, the exclusion of boxing is completely groundless and irrational, given the safety protection, sportmanship and popularity as reflected in this sport. I expect in the future, more views could arise to furnish the understanding in this regard.; I agree that boxing, although an important historical sport, should be considered in the light of modern health, safety and ethical considerations. It is an ancient sport which has been part of human culture for centuries, but the public debate on its relevance to the modern age has increased recently due to the risk of physical injury and the long-term health consequences of such injuries. It has become increasingly difficult to justify the continuation of a sport which has such serious health consequences for the boxers. The basic principle of boxing is to beat your opponent and to defeat him and thereby to cause serious bodily injury, including concussions, fractures and even death. Repeated blows to the head can lead to long-term brain damage, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a disease which has caused many former boxers to suffer in recent years. However, modern sports tend to rely more on strategy, speed and technique, rather than physical injury. For example, mixed martial arts (MMA) have been more adapted to a wide range of combat styles and have imposed stricter regulations on fights and more emphasis on safety, which can be seen as a shift towards a more humane kind of fighting. Moreover, in a society that now respects individual well-being and prefers a non-violent solution to the resolution of conflicts, the significance of a sport that promotes violence appears to be in contradiction with the ethics of non-violence. In short, although boxing has historical and cultural significance, the risk of serious bodily injury and the opposition to the modern value system make it inappropriate to continue in today's society. Finally, we cannot ignore the influence of boxing on society, because it is a kind of violence and aggressive behavior that tends to be promoted in a world that strives to reduce violence and encourage mental health. The emphasis must therefore be on the safety of boxers and on seeking alternatives that are in line with our current understanding of health and well-being.
1429;Boys are most influenced by their fathers and girls are most influenced by their mothers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons to support your opinion.;It is true that nowadays have a great influence children. Some people hold the opinion that the same sex is the major determination of influencing parent, but others . As far as I am concerned, . My arguments for this point are listed below.First of all, a father is the person who have already passed ways his son is passing now, in other words, sons are following their father’s footsteps. , based on experience it is easy for a father to notice his sons’ drawbacks and to influence them.Secondly, it is true that a boy is , a girl is a subtle and fragile one. It is hard for mothers to influence their sons, because it is not likely that can affect a strong one.In conclusion, it seems to me unfair that boys are most influenced by their mothers. Based on at least two points above I strongly agree that children are influenced by a parent of the same gender.; On the one hand, I do not reject the fact that parents play different roles in influencing children. However, I reject the sharp distinctions that are suggested by this statement. Boys are most influenced by their fathers and girls are most influenced by their mothers. Mothers often give young boys a sense of security and encouragement that they may not have received from fathers. This could develop in them a sense of self-esteem and understanding, which is essential for the development of social and emotional intelligence. However, girls need the attention and support of their fathers to raise their self-esteem and help them make good social and emotional decisions. Conversely, to say that girls are most influenced by their mothers ignores the positive role that fathers play in their daughters' lives. Fathers play a role in girls' development and help them to grow up with greater self-esteem and leadership skills. Besides, families are increasingly made up of a variety of figures, such as grandparents, siblings and guardians, which can make children more well-rounded and less bound by gender stereotypes. Both parents, regardless of their gender, have a deep influence on their children's lives, and the most influential relationships are based on love, respect and the active participation of parents, regardless of the original role of each parent.
1364;Changing drivers age limits is the best way to reduce traffic accidents (from Target Band ;This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskThe best way to reduce traffic accidents is to raise the age limit for younger drivers and to lower the age limit for elderly ones. Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsIn today’s world the number of traffic accidents is constantly rising as well as the number of injuries and deaths they cause. A better regulative approach is required traffic accidents can be reduced. Some people say that changing the drivers’ age limits is the best solution to the problem. However, there are other, more practical ways to deal with this problem.One alternative is imposing heavier fines the drivers who exceed the permitted alcohol consumption. According to recent , a great proportion of traffic accidents has alcohol as its reason. Utilising technology and installing devices that detect drunk drivers and lock car ignition can be used to keep people with track record of drunk driving off the roads. On some occasions and for repeat offenders in particular, a prison sentence may also be considered.Furthermore, people should be better educated and more careful while behind the wheel. To be more specific, people should learn to obey road rules and respect the other drivers instead of causing tension or submitting to road rage. In addition, heavy fines should also be levied for exceeded speed limits. Last but not least, safer and wider roads should be constructed to make for easier and more comfortable driving.Tightening age limits for drivers can be a complementary approach. For example, the elderly with vision problems or other important health issues should be excluded from driving. Besides, young people under 18 years old are considered immature to drive. However, maturity does not necessarily always increases with one’s age, which is why other measures are needed dangerous driving.In conclusion, I believe that stronger measures should be implemented for the prevention of traffic accidents, and drivers should have a more responsible attitude. Setting age limits could be helpful but should not be considered the optimal and only solution to the problem.The writer’s position is clear throughout the essay. There is a logical organisation of information and effective use of paragraphing. The range of vocabulary is wide enough for the student to show flexibility and accuracy of expression. Overall, the control of grammar and punctuation is good, with only a few errors made. The essay is up to the mark and is likely to get Band 8 in IELTS.; Of 2). Some people think that raising the minimum or maximum age for driving is the most effective way to reduce traffic accidents. But others think that it ignores the more effective ways and the nuances of driving ability. For example, people over the age of 70 are considered to be more vulnerable to the psychological and physical problems of old age. Young people, especially those under the age of twenty-one, are likely to be involved in accidents due to lack of experience, and if the age limit for unaccompanied driving was raised or if the rules for obtaining a driving license were changed, it is believed that the accident rate would decrease. In addition, if education for drivers, regardless of age, was strengthened, people would be better prepared to deal with complex driving conditions. Therefore, stricter regulations and age limits could be reduced, but changing the age limit is not the only way to prevent accidents. In addition, the ability to drive is not only a matter of age. Other factors such as experience, education and personal responsibility play an important role in a person's driving ability. Moreover, the traffic system such as road signs and signals is expected to have a significant effect on the safety of all drivers by making it easier for all drivers to know and obey the rules of the road. Driving ability should be continuously reviewed. If you take these factors into consideration, you will see that the age limit is not the only way to reduce traffic accidents.
1366;Childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents (agree/disagree);"Childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion and include relevant examples.It is true that parents need some knowledge and experience in order to raise their in an appropriate way. In this regard, many families attend different training courses. While I agree that these courses might be useful for some of them, I totally disagree with the recommended obligatory of such training.On the one hand, training courses usually offered by governments could be very useful for those guardians who have a with special needs. For example, if a child has a birth defect or has been diagnosed with any mental or musculoskeletal disorders, these kinds of training could be lifesaving. Additionally, as we know, the first few months after birth are really a crucial period of a child’s life; parents should obtain different information related to their child’s vaccinations, common health problems, different developmental issues and so on, which can be delivered through such training courses.On the other hand, I believe that making these programs a mandatory option would cause several problems for societies and individuals as well. To begin with, in order to achieve this goal, many professionals should be trained which may not be affordable for some governments. From an individual’s point of view, this kind of programs could be very time-consuming for some families who have other at home or who work long hours. The other important consideration is that parent training courses may not provide all the necessary information for each and every family. To be more specific, parents could get more beneficial information through different websites such as YouTube according to their own preferences.In conclusion, although I believe that many families can take advantage training courses, I do believe that making them a compulsory option for everyone is too time and money-consuming for individuals and governments.The introduction is very good and relevant. The writer’s position is balanced, relevantly and properly developed in two body paragraphs. The conclusion summarizes both sides of the argument and logically finished the essay. To maintain the necessary level of formality the word ‘kids’ should be replaced with ‘children’ everywhere in this essay. The use of prepositions needs more attention as some are inappropriate or incorrect. The length could be reduced – it’s not necessary to write a very long essay to get a higher score, and often it is better to write a shorter essay (no shorter than 250 words though!) but spend more time proofreading, correcting errors and improving the quality of writing. Overall this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.";" In recent years, the debate about the necessity of mandatory courses for all parents has grown significantly. In the first place, modern parenting is a complex task that cannot be underestimated. Although some argue that it is an instinctive process that does not require formal education, I firmly believe that such courses would benefit children by significantly improving their well-being and by enabling parents to acquire the necessary skills to raise healthy, well-adjusted children. These courses would provide parents with a basic knowledge of child development, communication, conflict resolution, and first aid and enable them to make the right decisions to provide a more supportive and caring environment for their children. The modern challenges facing parents are numerous and varied: the rapid development of technology, the growing tendency for children to have psychological problems, the pressures of a modern, fast-paced world, the role of social media, ... Unfortunately, many parents are unaware of the negative effects of their harmful behavior and are unaware of the development of their child's growth. In my opinion, such courses would give parents a basic knowledge of disorders and emotional disorders and would help them to become more aware of the needs of their children. In many professions, the public is provided with a minimum level of education to ensure that a competent professional can meet the basic needs of their profession. When it comes to raising the next generation, society has an interest in promoting the health, safety and education of children. It can be argued that such courses violate the personal and parental rights of parents; but the benefits of well-informed parents can override these concerns. By providing parents with the necessary knowledge and skills, we can educate a more able and healthier generation that can cope with the challenges of a rapidly changing world. In conclusion, although many people believe that parenting is an innate experience, the implementation of compulsory child-care courses would be a great benefit to parents and children."
1384;Children should be engaged in paid work, agree or disagree?;"In many countries children are engaged in different kinds of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?The issue of whether or not children should be engaged in some paid work has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that having some employment experience is conducive to a child’s learning and development, I contend that it would bring harm to the child’s and learning.First of all, a workplace designed for adults normally child-friendly facilities. Desks and chairs are too high for a child; the light switches are installed on the walls unreachable children; also emergency training and facilities such as phones are only provided to adults. Furthermore, various hazards such as polluted air and chemical fumes are still produced in factories and farms. Undoubtedly young people would suffer in such workplaces.Also, children would find it frustrating when they are not properly inducted before starting a job. A child working in a cement factory would feel a setback when he could not get immediate support while struggling with the procedures of recording different raw materials that required by the job. Further, without sufficient support, a child’s misunderstanding or inappropriately communicating with adults would only disappoint him and prevents him from active learning and interacting with other people.To conclude, a child’s paid employment experience would lead to a negative impact on their health and active learning. However, recognizing the importance of children’s learning and their awareness of responsibility, it is advisable to encourage them to be involved in some volunteering opportunities where they can meaningfully learn and interact with other people with sufficient care and support in place for such jobs.This is a good essay. There are only a few errors (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections), but otherwise this work seems worthy of Band 7.5 or 8. Remember to always proofread your essay before submitting it. Keep up the good work!"; It is one of the main concerns that children who are engaged in paid work can endanger their education. There are many arguments that children who are engaged in paid work can acquire useful life experience and be taught to earn money, but I am not in favor of children being engaged in paid work because it may negatively affect their development and education. The first priority of children should be education and development, and any involvement in work can distract them from the acquisition of knowledge necessary for their future success. Childhood is a key period of development and acquisition of knowledge, and the task of children to work is a time-consuming one and is a waste of time. Children should be allowed to enjoy their childhood, develop their hobbies and interests, and develop in the fields of their recreation. In addition, the fact that children are engaged in paid work exposes them to the stress of an adult environment. Juggling work and studies may lead to a feeling of anxiety and weariness and may negatively affect their mental health. Besides the above, child labor also brings the risk of exploitation. In the past, many children have been exposed to unsafe working conditions, unreasonable working hours, and a pittance in payment. Besides, stress from work can suppress creativity, curiosity and love for learning, which is so necessary during the first years of life. In short, although there are some advantages in introducing children into the labor market, the disadvantages are far greater. The first priority should be the preservation of education and development. Children should be protected from exploitation, not legitimized. We should encourage the development of their hobbies and interests, support their education and develop their skills.
1383;Children these days are suffering from obesity, why and how can it be solved?;Modern children are suffering from the diseases that were once considered to be meant for adults only. Obesity is a major disease prevalent among children. What are its causes and what solutions can be offered?Nowadays, the increasing rate of overweight children and adults is a worldwide health issue. Obesity is a major problem which is increasing day by day in children. There are various reasons behind it. This essay will discuss the causes of obesity and offer some solutions.The first cause of obesity is junk food. It is often seen that mostly children are fond of burgers, pizzas, noodles and . These types of foods are easily available to them in school canteens. Children love to purchase chips, , ice-cream for lunch. Moreover, in this modern era, parents are working and they do not have time to cook at home. Parents often buy dinner for their children instead of preparing food at home. This calorie-rich diet is making children obese. This problem can be solved by teaching children to cook healthy foods for themselves and banning junk foods and fizzy drinks in schools. This diet can be replaced by milk, juice and fruits for lunch.The second cause of obesity is . It is true that the use of computers and television is increasing children. They spend most of their time watching television or playing video games on a computer. This technological advancement has reduced the level of physical activity in this specific age group. This issue can be resolved by encouraging children to do physical exercises. Parents can take their children to park to encourage playing with friends. Furthermore, schools can add sports in their curriculum to maintain physical fitness in their students.To sum up, it is clear that main causes of obesity are unhealthy eating and not enough physical activities. This ailment can be prevented and treated by healthy eating and physical exercises.This is a good essay. There are only a few minor errors that could have been easily prevented by proofreading this essay one last time before submission (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). Overall, this work seems worthy of IELTS Band 8. Keep up the good work!; This task is to be solved for the following reasons: Obesity in children is a worldwide problem today, resulting from the sedentary nature of modern life, eating habits, and the influence of technology. The reasons for childhood obesity are the decline in physical activity, the increase in consumption of fast and industrial food, and the extensive use of screens that interfere with physical activities. Children with physical activity have a lower risk of being overweight and obese. Children today spend a lot of time on the use of screens, such as mobile phones, tablets and TVs, which often replaces the practice of gymnastics and other sports. We need a multi-factor solution, involving parents, schools and communities. The main thing is education, parents need to be encouraged to provide a balanced diet and limit the number of sugary snacks in their homes. These foods, which are high in calories and lack of nutrients, result in unhealthy weight gain. Furthermore, communities can help create an environment where healthy habits can be developed. Schools can create physical activity programs and a healthy diet, and can include nutrition classes in the curriculum. Children need to have access to safe playgrounds, which are available to them. Organizing joint sports and nutrition classes for children will motivate them to develop healthy habits. Publicity campaigns about the risks of obesity and the importance of a healthy diet and regular exercise can also have a significant effect. A healthy and active generation will be the result of the joint efforts.
857;Competitiveness is a positive quality for people in most societies. How does competitiveness affect individuals? Is it a positive or negative trend?;Life is full of competition. Soon after the release from competitive university exams, the hard fighting for higher positions in a company will be waiting for you. While the competitiveness has been bringing us a convenient society, no small number of employments have been tired of never-ending competitions. No doubt about a positive effect on societies, but when we start to argue about the effect on individuals, it becomes more controversial. This essay will argue the drawbacks of competitiveness for individuals, especially from the perspective of Japanese modern society and typical Japanese office workers. I believe that cooperativeness and uniqueness are sometimes more important attitude than competitiveness.Firstly, competitiveness causes less diversity. If there is a competition, there must be the same evaluation metrics to differentiate winners and losers. The evaluation procedure needs to limit the metrics into specific aspects of the human being. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to prove that the metrics are proper for all of the possible cases and effective for the HR evaluation. For example, Japanese companies are likely to judge quantitatively based on the numbers related to performance. However, how can we evaluate the cooperativity or the non-quantitative performance like in creative jobs? Most Japanese companies adopted the HR evaluation methods based on average working hours per day and number of reports monthly. That’s why the Japanese tend to overwork to fulfill this requirement. In addition, as a result of placing more importance in quantity of reports, rather than quality, Japanese employees are prone to choose easy and short-term tasks or outsourcing instead of building by their own methods. This tendency causes fewer complicated and long-term tasks.Secondly, competitiveness causes less cooperativeness. Fewer people volunteer to play a disadvantageous role for smooth teamwork. Moreover, some people play an evil role by blaming or cheating the competitors in order to be superior to them. As a consequence, overall efficiency will decline and some people will be overestimated. Even if there are no problems temporarily, the long-lasting large companies will eventually become corrupt, and those who have the most political power, rather than real power, will remain at the top.Consequently, competitiveness is the basis of capitalism which brings us a brighter and more convenient society, however, biased evaluation and less cooperative working environment possibly drive people into nervous breakdowns. Karoshi, overwork death derived from too much stress and less sleeping, is one of the most serious social problems in Japan. We may need to rethink about the competitiveness.; But the effects of competitiveness are both positive and negative, and they affect individuals in different ways. The desire to excel and surpass others has led to many personal and social achievements in many societies. This quality also helps individuals grow and develop as they strive to learn, change and become more resourceful. On the one hand, competitiveness can motivate people to work hard and achieve their goals. Competition can also promote social progress. For example, in an academic setting, students compete with each other to improve their knowledge and skills, which can help them to succeed in their careers later. But the disadvantages of this trend cannot be ignored either. Too much competition can cause anxiety and depression, especially if people are under constant pressure to compete with each other. In a competitive economy, the demand for products and services increases, as individuals seek to make the most of the opportunities they have been given, thus creating jobs and promoting economic growth. Furthermore, in the most extreme cases, competition can lead to unethical behavior, such as cheating and corruption, as individuals try to gain an unfair advantage over others. In conclusion, although competitiveness can have a positive impact on people, it is very easy to get out of balance. People's lives are full of comparisons, and this can cause mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression, especially if people's self-esteem is connected to their achievements. Competition is a natural phenomenon in human society, but it must be based on a healthy foundation, which not only encourages personal development and achievement but also enables people to act in a moral and honest manner.
425;Computers are now the basis of the modern world. They should therefore be introduced into classrooms, and their programs used for direct teaching purposes. However, dependence on computers in teaching may carry a certain degree of risk to students.Discuss both sides and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Computers are presntly an integral part of the civilized world and are essential to daily living.

The world is fast changing and students need to meet up and be at par with others in the world. The globe is becoming a more digital place and computers are the core of that, teaching using computers will open students' minds to new possibilitiies, faster approaches and more advanced ways of solving problems. A recent study showed that 75% of students who were taught using computers are currently more successful than others in their work places.It is understandable that people also think that dependence on computers in teaching may be detrimental to students. The students may become lazy and may not necessarily want to use their brains to calculate or understand things because the computer has already done that for them. Also using computers to learn in the school environment is also just adding to screen time for the learners; they are already being exposed to lots of wrong things at home adding school to it may not neceesarily the best option.Personally, students have a lot to learn using computers but truthfully speaking most of them already have the technological know how when it comes to using computers and if they actually want to learn more about how to use them, they can do so at home using the popular learning sites, it doesnt necessarily have to be introduced into the school learning system.In conclusion,computers are currently the foundation of the modern world and have their advantages and disadvantages, if they are put to the right use at the appropriate place and time, its benefits are beyond measure."; Write at least 270 words. There is no doubt that the modern world has introduced a great many different teaching and learning resources that can enhance the educational experience. In the context of the contemporary educational landscape, introducing computers into the classroom has become a necessity. However, the use of computers in the classroom may pose some risks to students. For example, they may become less socially competent as they become more accustomed to virtual interactions rather than face-to-face communication. Moreover, technology prepares students for the digital world by encouraging the development of the skills of digital literacy and critical thinking, which are essential for success in the job market. However, overreliance on technology may hamper the development of problem-solving and analytical skills. Besides, excessive use of technology can lead to health problems, such as bad posture, eyestrain and a sedentary lifestyle. In my opinion, although the advantages of introducing technology into the classroom are many, it is important to proceed with caution and strike a balance between technology and other forms of teaching. The ability to think independently is essential to encourage creativity and innovation. This balance will enable students to benefit from technology without losing the life skills needed for personal and social development. For example, by combining technology with project-based learning, students can enhance their collaboration skills while still being required to work closely with their peers.
1329;Crime rates are likely to decline due to the advancements in technology, which will help prevent and solve crimes in an easier way. Do you agree or disagree?;"Nowadays technology is advancing faster than ever and many fields are benefitting from the opportunities this trend presents. Some think that crime prevention can be one possible application of new technologies, by allowing to deter offenders or solve crimes in a faster and easier way. In my opinion, innovation in crime prevention can be a game-changer that will reduce both the number of crimes committed and the time it takes to catch those responsible for them.Not everyone is optimistic about the prospects of the use of new technologies in crime prevention, and those who subscribe to the more pessimistic view say that advanced technologies can be accessed by criminals, therefore raising the crime rates. Such tools can, indeed, cause more damage if they fall in the wrong hands; however, it would require the offenders to be highly skilled to be able to use the modern technologies. Statistically, many of them tend to have a lower level of education, and for that reason they are likely to stick to the old ways of committing crimes, whereas the minority of highly skilled criminals are unlikely to make a big difference to the crime levels.Law enforcement workforce, on the other hand, has a much better grip on modern technology. Nowadays police officers and detectives undergo special training, take regular skill update courses, and use high-tech equipment. Facial recognition and thermal imaging are just two examples of the important tools that police are already using to find and catch offenders faster. Ordinary citizens can do their part in preventing burglaries by installing sophisticated systems with sensors, CCTV video feed and various alarms to detect and deter thieves. The combined effort will, no doubt, push the crime curve down.To sum up, even though the wonders of technology are available to everyone, it seems to me that they will better assist law enforcement in solving crimes, and law-abiding citizens in protecting themselves and their property, rather than felons. This will tip the balance in favour of reduction in crime rate and make the world a safer place."; I largely agree with this statement, because technological innovations have greatly improved both crime prevention and crime solving, thereby making it difficult for criminals to thrive. Firstly, the wide use of surveillance equipment such as closed-circuit TV (CCTV) and drones has made a significant contribution to crime prevention. This form of deterrence is particularly effective in cities, where visibility is limited. It has been proven that in areas where extensive surveillance equipment is available, crime rates are often lower, because the risk of being caught increases significantly. Second, the development of data science and artificial intelligence has revolutionized police work, and with the help of this type of advanced analysis, police forces are able to allocate resources more effectively and respond more quickly to crime hotspots. In addition, the development of forensics has transformed the way crimes are solved. The availability of advanced forensic equipment such as DNA analyzers and digital forensics helps to gather evidence more quickly and accurately. This not only helps reduce crime rates but also improves community safety. In conclusion, although technology alone cannot eradicate crime, technological advancements can help reduce the crime rate. More surveillance, improved prediction, and enhanced forensic capabilities will probably help reduce crime rates.
1363;Dieting can change a person’s life for better or worse (from Target Band ;This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskDieting can change a person’s life for the better or ruin one’s health completely. What is your opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsSome argue that dieting has an extraordinary impact on one’s life, whereas others are of a view that it absolutely adversely affects a person’s health. It cannot be denied that dieting taken to extremes may cause more harm than good, however, in my opinion effective dieting is pivotal for maintaining good health and keeping a more attractive body shape.First of all, the possibility of increasing level of physical health lies with incorporating proper dieting in our lives. It is reasonable to suggest that dieting is effective for controlling our body weight within an ideal range in order to achieve the normal score of body mass index (BMI), which is essential for preventing us from overweight or obese. As a result, the risk of suffering an illness will be reduced. A recent research concluded that dieting is one of the most effective measures to cut down one’s body weight among the obese group, and it helps to improve their medical condition indirectly.Moreover, dieting is crucial for keeping ideal body features regardless of gender and age. A fit and presentable body outlook absolutely boosts up one’s level in his or her social life, not to mention professions that require keeping one’s body in an attractive physical shape. For example, dieting is adopted as a popular way for reducing weight among actors and actresses. A recent article reported that an actress who successfully regained her slim body after a period of dieting was offered an excellent job opportunity in the Hollywood film industry.In conclusion, in my opinion dieting has a positive influence on one’s life in terms of maintaining a profound level of health and keeping a more attractive body outlook.The writer’s opinion is very clear from the start and throughout the entire essay. Paragraphing is used effectively to organise ideas and information. The use of advanced vocabulary enables accuracy of expression and highlights flexibility. Overall, the control of grammar and punctuation is good, with only a few errors made. The essay is a good example of an IELTS Band 8 work.; , paragraph 4). Considering both outcomes of dieting is important for those who are considering a diet. For people with health problems such as obesity, diabetes or high blood pressure, adopting a balanced diet can bring many benefits. It has been scientifically proven that losing just a little weight can reduce blood pressure, lower cholesterol and improve blood sugar levels. On the other hand, a well-planned diet can lead to a negative outcome. Dieting can be very damaging if done without responsibility. The motivation that comes from positive physical changes can help improve the self-image and self-confidence, which in turn can lead to the development of new healthy habits, such as exercising and being mindful. However, the negative energy and poor health that come from poor nutrition can result in negative changes in a person’s mood, emotional stability and body image. The obsession with food and eating, which can lead to anxiety and binge-restrict cycles, can cause physical and mental problems. A healthy diet can improve people’s lives, but if taken to the extreme, it can be a source of stress and anxiety. Therefore, a balanced, educated approach to dieting is essential to reap its benefits and avoid the potential for negative outcomes. In conclusion, dieting can bring positive changes to a person’s life, but it is essential to adopt a responsible and balanced attitude to it.
1417;Dieting can change a person’s life for the better or ruins one’s health completely. What is your opinion?;Almost of the women today want a beautiful figure. That is why we are able to find a diet programme almost everywhere in the country. Most of the women have and gone on a diet before either to or just health problem.A proper diet programme will help you not only to slim down but also to have a eating habits. For instance more vegetables and fruits meat, fried food and carbonated drinks. For a diet programme we shouldn’t food and water. There are some diet programmes from the doctors that help you to have a heart like the “Three day diet” which we can find on the Internet. This programme allows you to eat fruits and also some meat. This way of dieting will help you to avoid some of the health problems in the future like or a heart attack.However some people do not only go on a diet but they avoid eating and hungry for the whole day. All they have is just either water or juices. Also there people who buy special diet programmes over the counter which are not approved by the health department and they are doing so without consulting a doctor first. They do not follow the basic rules of dieting and this will lead them to some serious health problems like of some body parts or, even worse, death.In my opinion there is wrong with going on a diet as long as we follow the correct way of eating and .; According to my point of view, the success of a diet depends on the diet itself and on the attitude of the individual to food and health. The diet is a constant in our culture, it can completely change a person’s life. It can bring either positive changes or a devastating impact on health. A well-planned diet can lead to a significant change in a person's life, because it brings about a loss of weight, increased energy, better physical health, a balanced diet that consists of fruits, vegetables, cereals and lean meat. The brain is developed, chronic diseases are reduced, sleep disorders are eliminated. Secondly, a bad diet can have disastrous effects on health. Those who stick to a healthy diet and eat healthy foods also have a positive relationship to food, because they eat more mindfully, and therefore appreciate food. The more they understand this, the more fulfilled their life is. The desire to be thin can lead to unhealthy habits, such as bingeing and the development of a negative relationship to food, which can lead to a yo-yo diet and dissatisfaction with one's body. Bad diets lead to nutritional deficiencies, which then lead to a decrease in the immune system, weakened bones, depression and other disorders. In conclusion, although a diet can change a person's life for the better, one must carefully study the chosen diet and try to stick to it. A balanced diet with a variety of healthy foods can enrich a person's life, while an unhealthy and extreme diet can lead to a sharp decline in health.
1409;Dieting can change a person’s life for the better or ruins one’s health completely. What’s your opinion?;Dieting seems to be of our life in this modern society, especially for those who are health conscious. Different people choose different type of dieting methods, trying to achieve what they believe to be good for either their health or physical appearance. In general, most of the people who diet are focusing on controlling their weight.In our urban society, most of the working class not have the opportunity to consume . Their daily meals consist of fast food which contains large amounts of fat and salt. The most significant of this unhealthy lifestyle is the weight gain especially among those middle age working professionals.Therefore, most of these young and energetic people have to control their diet in order to stay in shape either for their appearance or health. The most common and proper method of maintaining one’s weight is eating less oily food, preferably more green vegetables, fruits and alcohol.However, some have resorted to losing weight by taking their diet to the extreme, not eating at all for days. Others will make themselves vomit after each meal. Many others will go for dieting medication and beverages that help them to lose their appetite. These unhealthy will cause internal damage in the long run.In my opinion, dieting for better health is more important than solely for looking attractive. Individuals who wish to control their weight should seek professional if they are unable to reduce their weight after switching over to a healthy diet for a period of time. Losing weight and losing your health at the same time does not benefit any individual.This essay needs some work. The first body paragraph explains the reason people have for dieting, whereas it should explain what are the advantages or the dangers of it. The second body paragraph explains how to diet, whereas it should present arguments for or against dieting. Therefore, the task is only partially covered here.; On the one hand, a well-structured and balanced diet can remarkably change a person’s life. Dieting has become a very popular subject in modern society with a great influence on our mental and physical health. According to some studies, diets rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean meat not only help with the loss of excess weight, but also help to maintain the body and strengthen the immune system. On the other hand, the development of healthy eating habits can have a calming effect on the human psyche, the individual will gain power over themselves and they will begin to understand their bodies. The process of gaining and losing weight is not only destructive for the metabolism, but also leads to an unhealthy relationship with food, anxiety and guilt in relation to food. On the other hand, there are many types of extreme diets that lead to various diseases, such as severe calorie reduction or the elimination of entire food groups, which leads to a decrease in nutrients and can lead to eating disorders. In my opinion, the influence of dieting on a person’s life depends on how he approaches it, a balanced, informed and lasting diet can improve his health and morale. Moreover, social pressure to achieve an ideal body can lead to severe mental disorders, depression and self-esteem, especially in vulnerable groups. It is therefore necessary for an individual to seek advice from a qualified health professional when changing his diet, so that he does not endanger his mental and physical health with a healthy diet.
1323;Discipline is a growing problem in modern schools. Some people think that parents should discipline their own children, while others think it should be the responsibility of the government. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;While some people argue that parents should take sole responsibility for disciplining their children, others take the view that the government should be in charge of such matters. In my opinion, the young generation should be primarily guided by their parents where rules of behavior and moral principles are concerned. However, in some instances government intervention is necessary.On one side of the argument, there are people who hold the opinion that the responsibility of disciplining a child falls squarely on parents’ shoulders, since they are their first educators, and it is their duty to equip their children with good manners and morals even before their first day at school. In addition, every family has a unique understanding of what a suitable form of discipline entails. Therefore, some parents are concerned that any form of punishment meted out at school might be too harsh. To overcome this issue, they believe that parents should be informed by the school of their child’s wrongdoing so that they could decide an appropriate consequence for their behavior at home.Unfortunately, not all parents are objective enough to make the right decisions when it comes to the upbringing of their children. Some may lack information or sound moral background to discipline their children in a meaningful way. Therefore, the state should shoulder some of the responsibility by implementing a strict set of guidelines and policies on how to discipline children at school. I believe that such policies result in children who flourish and are more likely to become productive citizens that actively contribute to a prosperous nation. Also, this would help both parents and teachers understand which punishments are suitable for minor infractions like missing an assignment or major incidents like bullying or skipping school.In conclusion, while both views are commonly held in society, I believe that the government must be actively involved in the policies related to discipline at schools as this would ensure the well-being and successful development of the youth.; On the one hand, many people think that parents should take responsibility for the education of their children. Both views have their own good reasons, and understanding both views can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the problem. Parents know their children's individual characters, strengths and weaknesses, and can choose the most appropriate methods of punishment. At the same time, consistent discipline at home can help schools teach moral standards and build a harmonious learning environment. On the other hand, some people argue that the government should intervene in the education of children, and that this is due to the diversity of parents' ideas, and the neglect and abuse that may exist in some families. The idea of this view is that parents are more able to guide children's education, and that children who are taught to behave properly are more likely to have a basic understanding of social morality and respect for authority. Both parents and the government should be involved in the education of children. The government can provide parents with the necessary education and guidance, so that they can teach their children to act in a better way. In the end, school discipline is the responsibility of parents, schools and governments. Parents must do their best to guide the education of their children, while the government can provide certain regulations and resources to assist them.
1066;Eating sweet foods produces acid in the mouth, which can cause tooth decay. (High acid levels are measured by low pH values)Describe the information below and discuss the implications for dental health.;The given graph shows the level of acidity in the mouth from consuming food that contains fruit or cane sugar and honey.To start with, if we take a look at honey-consistent food, we will notice that the acid level increases within the first 5 minutes. After that, the level of acidity remains at the rate of less than 5 pH, and, then goes down to a normal level. So, it is unlikely tooth decay to occur within such a short period of time.Regarding fruit and cane sugar-consistent food, it is quite noticeable that the acidity level increases dramatically at a level of less than 5.5 pH and 4.5 pH, respectively. However, the main difference between fruit and cane sugar is that the acid level of fruit sugar decreases within a bit more than 15 minutes. In contrast to it, the acid level of cane sugar goes down to a normal level within more than 25 minutes, which is more likely to get tooth decay.; Sugary foods are the food of bacteria that are normally present in the mouth. The bacteria convert the sugars to acids that lower the pH value and produce acid. The relationship between sweet foods and dental health is an important subject in the area of nutrition and oral hygiene. A continuous exposure to acid can lead to tooth decay, which is characterized by cavities and structural damage to the teeth. A low pH value and high acid production are consequential. The high acidity damages the teeth, because it wears away the enamel, the outer protective layer of the teeth. When sweets are frequently consumed, especially in combination with poor oral hygiene, the acid-erosion process continues and can lead to severe dental problems. The pH scale has a range from 0 to 14, where lower values mean more acidity. A value of 5.5 and lower is usually considered unfavorable, as this indicates an environment where dental decay can occur. To reduce the negative effects of sweets on the teeth, it is recommended to eat them in moderation and as part of a balanced diet that includes dairy products, fruit and vegetables that help neutralize the acids. Good oral hygiene, twice daily brushing with fluoride toothpaste and regular dental visits, also reduce the risk of dental decay. The importance of nutrition in maintaining good dental health is emphasized by this circumstance. In the long run, knowledge and preventive measures will lead to a healthier smile and an improved general health.
1362;Education in financial management should be a mandatory component of the school program, agree/disagree (from Target Band ;This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskEducation in financial management should be a mandatory component of the school program. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsMore and more young adults in our country are heavily indebted. Thus, it is considered by some that it should be mandatory to educate school children the administration of money. In my opinion, people should not leave school without a sound knowledge of financial management.To begin with, a country’s development is strongly upon the purchasing capacity of its inhabitants. That is to say, people who are in debt or financially vulnerable, would not be able to spend freely or invest, for example, in a new house, thus hindering the economic growth of the country. As a consequence, the rate of inflation would rise and people would be able to afford even less, which could ultimately result in the collapse of the entire economy. A good example of this vicious circle can be seen in countries such as Argentina, where people have to buy household items in the black market, because they cannot afford to buy them in regular stores due to skyrocketing prices. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to teach children early money management.Another point to consider is the low standard of living that people have when they mismanage their finances. Individuals who are constantly short of money could eventually end up being socially isolated and unhappy, because they couldn’t afford to participate in leisure activities, such as going to the cinema with a friend, resulting in their from social life. However, this could be avoided with ease by offering courses in money management.In conclusion, I strongly believe that school children should be taught how to manage their finances to prevent social isolation later in their life as well as to maintain the economic force of their country.The writer’s position is clear throughout the essay. Paragraphing is used effectively to organise ideas and information, however the paragraphs could have been balanced better in terms of the amount of content. The advanced vocabulary the writer uses creates a good impression of mature and fluent writer. Overall, the control of grammar and punctuation is fine, and the number of errors is small. The essay could achieve Band 8 in IELTS.; 1). If you have any difficulties with this, please ask your teacher for help. In today's increasingly complex economic environment, financial literacy is a key skill for students' future success and personal well-being. There are many reasons why financial management education should be a compulsory part of the school program. Many young people graduate from school without the basic knowledge of how to deal with their finances, and many end up in financial trouble because of their debts, bad savings or poor investments. If financial education is taught in school, it will help them make better financial decisions. As a result, it will help the economy grow and develop, and a better informed population is better able to invest in businesses, save for the future and buy goods and services. In addition, financial education plays an important role in promoting economic stability and prosperity in a country. Financial products have become more complex, and the development of fintech has made them even more complex, so students need a solid basis in financial management to cope with the complexities of the market. Moreover, the introduction of digital currencies and online banking has increased the importance of financial education. Therefore, a compulsory financial education in schools will also have a broader societal purpose. Putting the money aside for financial education will help ensure a financially conscious and stable future generation. Therefore, financial education in schools is a necessary requirement for students to develop a responsible attitude to finances and society.
1421;Even though Globalization affects the world’s economics in a very positive way, its negative sides should not be forgotten. Discuss.;Everything has sides in the world, and so has the of globalization . The effects of globalization on the world economy are .We must acknowledge that the negative effects are from a different kind than the positive ones. the negative sides, like low in less developed countries are important to .If we take the Eurozone for example, the economic changes the process are huge. Many companies have transferred their factories into cheaper production to in the world . The results are rising unemployment rates in the “old industrial countries”.In regard to the other countries on the world market, such as China, this job transfer is a big opportunity. But no one can that the consequences for the less developed countries where economy flourished, based on availability of cheap employees are highly important: globalization based on this facts brings problems.Nevertheless, there are also . In general it is remarkable that there is a new tendency in “Thinking Global”. For instance, people are willing to more languages and get educated about cultures. Countries as undeveloped, such as India, are getting chances to be the in a certain field.All in all it can be said that the effects of globalization are enormous. The of economic processes has changed completely. It is important to think in bigger terms, not just about the country. The positive things that this globalization process have brought us for the negative sides. The should be a world in balance, but this has yet to come.; Write about the positive and negative sides of the era of globalization. For many developing countries, globalization has led to the expansion of foreign direct investment, the development of local economies and the creation of employment. The most important problem is the increase in income inequality. However, although the benefits of globalization are considerable, there are negative repercussions that are just as important. As a result of increased competition between companies, the price of products and services has fallen and the range of goods and services has increased. However, the conditions of labor have not changed as much as in the past, and the importance of capital in the process of production has increased, leading to stagnation in wages in developed countries and a shift in industry to countries with lower labor costs. Secondly, as wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, a huge gap often develops between the rich and the poor. And thirdly, globalization destroys the economies and cultures of local areas. Often, a desire for expansion and profit leads to the exploitation of natural resources, to deforestation, to pollution and to climate change. For this reason, cultural imperialism can cause the destruction of national identity. Finally, although there are many benefits to the development of the world economy and the emergence of innovation, there are also many problems that must be solved. Despite the difficulties that need to be overcome, both policy makers and global citizens must try to find the right balance. If we want everyone to benefit from the era of globalization, it is necessary to consider such issues as the preservation of the environment, the need to share wealth, and the preservation of culture.
1319;Even though experts believe that walking is a great way to improve one’s health, very few people walk nowadays. Why aren’t people walking? What can be done to encourage them to walk more?;The benefits of walking are numerous, and experts recommend it as a good way to keep healthy and fit. Despite this, the number of people who walk on a daily basis is on the decline. The reasons for this are manifold, but there are also several solutions that may help people walk more.Lack of time is the most common reason people cite for not engaging in any form of physical activity. These days most people have hectic schedules that involve juggling their work and home responsibilities. As a result, they are often too exhausted or pressed for time and therefore opt for faster and more comfortable forms of transport, such as cars, bikes or public transport. Another major reason for the reduced number of pedestrians on the roads is a lack of safety. Most full-time workers are not free to walk during the day, and will skip it in the evenings or early morning hours, if they do not feel safe enough to do so.Fortunately, there are quite a few solutions to this issue. One is making walkers safe, which means the government should ensure that there are enough sidewalks and streetlights available in every suburb, so that pedestrians can walk or jog safely whenever time allows. Another useful option is to create special walking tracks and parks in neighbourhoods where people can get some much-needed exercise in the evenings. The added benefit of promoting the healthy lifestyle and walking in the community makes this solution even more attractive.To conclude, the pressures of daily life and lack of safely while walking reduce the popularity of this healthy practice. Governments can reverse this trend by creating more green spaces for people to walk in and addressing their safety concerns.; The problem is that there are several reasons why people don’t walk. There are a number of reasons for this. First of all, technology has changed the habits of people: in a time of digital devices, people are less interested in effort and more in comfort, and for short trips they often prefer to drive, go on a bicycle or use public transport. Second, many cities are designed to give priority to vehicles, so there are no safe sidewalks, crossings or zebras, and the sidewalks are in a poor condition. All this leads to a decrease in opportunities for walking and thus to a further increase in sedentary activities. Third, large shopping malls that are difficult to reach by foot have been set up in many cities, and the opportunity to walk is reduced in many communities. Several measures can be taken to encourage people to walk. As a first step, the city can be designed to give priority to the development of pedestrians: sidewalks should be wide, lighting should be increased and traffic should be calmed. Secondly, the city can organize the formation of walking groups and motivate people to walk by organizing various competitions and rewarding achievements. Moreover, parks with attractive pedestrian routes should be established. And thirdly, walking routes should be created on major roads, and more and more famous people should be walking. In conclusion, walking has many benefits for health, but it is not enough for everyone to do so.
1410;Even though globalization affects the world’s economy in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. Discuss.;Everything has two sides and the globalization is not exception. Our first thoughts about this topic include the process of global “McDonaldisation” and, generally speaking, spreading across the whole Globe.Firstly, I would try to concentrate on the positive aspects of globalisation. As far as economy is concerned, like the Global Bank or IMF are always focused on developing the ‘Third World’ and helping poor people to combat their life obstacles (through loans and donations). Moreover, the world becomes an area of sharing thoughts (e.g. philosophical or economical doctrines), which become popular due to lack of barriers.However, disadvantages of globalization are also widely known. Some people insist that because of this process, the spirit of countries and nations rapidly disappears. The integrity, established years ago is on the verge of collapsing. Furthermore, there’s a strong lobby of communists who , that the globalization indicates an uncontrolled reign of capitalists and slave work of lower labour-class. We should never forget about the detrimental impact of global investments on the environment – the green house effect or soar rains are triggered by globalization.To sum up, globalization has both positive and negative influence on our everyday life. I can’t agree with the popular statement that we should try to avoid being affected by it. However, we must not forget about our surroundings and local communities. They have a great value which should last forever.; It has become the main characteristic of the world’s economy, shaping cultures and societies. On the one hand, it has a positive effect on the world’s economy, as it increases trade, technological development and the exchange of ideas. But its dark side cannot be ignored, as it increases inequality, destroys national cultures and increases economic insecurity. Moreover, it has made the international economy more efficient and more competitive, as it increases specialization, which leads to increased development. One of the most important advantages of globalization is the increased economic interdependence between nations. Countries can now produce goods and services in which they have comparative advantages, thus increasing their efficiency and innovation. The emergence of multi-national corporations leads to exploitation of labor in the countries where these companies are established. Moreover, globalization gives consumers access to a wide range of goods and services, often at lower prices, as a result of increased competition. Nevertheless, the negative effects of globalization cannot be ignored and are often neglected. It has led to the homogenization of societies, which have lost their cultural diversity and are now exposed to the dominance of Western values and lifestyles. Economic inequality has increased, and within and between countries, the rich become richer and the poor poorer. When it comes to tackling inequality and cultural issues, governments need to keep in mind the advantages and disadvantages of globalization. In conclusion, although globalization has many advantages for the economy, it is important not to forget its negative side. In order to achieve inclusive and sustainable growth, governments need to make sure that they have a say in the international economy.
1306;Every household should have a government-imposed limit on the amount of rubbish it can throw away. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"The amount of waste people produce can be quite shocking, with every person generating kilograms of rubbish in a single day, and all this can be difficult to manage. This has given some people the idea that there should be a limitation on the amount of rubbish produced per household; however, opinions are divided as to whether this would be the the most effective option.Having a limitation on the amount of waste produced sounds like a fine solution to a significant problem, with over two hundred and fifty million tons being generated in 2016 by the U.S. alone. Taxing households that break limits would push people to produce less waste and make them more mindful of what can be recycled or composted. However, forcing people to produce less waste might not be attainable.Households produce as much waste as they need to live their lifestyles. The waste people generate is only a result of the products they purchase, and will most likely wish to continue to purchase. Taxing people may be a cause of resentment, with many of them already struggling to pay their usual bills. In addition, if people produce more than they are allowed, this will encourage littering and dumping, so that they are not caught with more waste than entitled, and this in turn will damage the environment.Though controlling the amount of waste produced is important, there could be other ways of encouraging lesser output. In my opinion, governments should encourage composting and recycling, which will also reduce wasted material. People should also be more aware of what waste they produce and how it can be reduced. An education drive on these issues would perhaps be more likely to succeed in reducing rubbish than imposing limitations."; Writing a thesis statement on the subject “Every household should have a government-imposed limit on the amount of rubbish it can throw away” is a controversial issue, with very different opinions. While the objective of reducing waste to the minimum is in line with the goals of sustainable development, there are also a number of practical and ethical problems associated with such a law. As has been seen in Sweden and Germany, where it is becoming increasingly important to reduce the amount of rubbish deposited in the trash, a fixed limit could be the beginning of a major change in behavior towards greater responsibility for the environment. With rising concerns about overflowing waste and environmental pollution, it is possible that a regulated limit would force households to take more sustainable habits, such as composting, reducing single-use plastics, etc. It is also possible that the law would lead to unforeseen consequences, such as illegal waste disposal or black-market trade, which would not serve the purpose of the law. However, such a fixed limit would also put a disproportionate burden on the families of lower incomes and larger households, as they have a greater need to throw away diapers and medical supplies for the elderly. Also, the government could be distracted from other, more effective measures, such as promoting waste reduction education and improving the availability of good-quality materials for reuse. In short, while the limits on the amount of rubbish a household can throw away are in line with the sustainable goals of sustainable development, they must be questioned in terms of both their feasibility and fairness. As a result, a more supportive and open approach that emphasizes education and improved conditions may give better results in the fight for sustainable development.
1406;Every year an increasing number of students choose to go to another country for their higher education. Do you think the benefits of this development outweigh the problems associated with it?;The past twenty years have seen a dramatic change the number of students who go abroad . In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of this trend.On the one hand, both students and their country can benefit from this trend. First, students can choose more suitable methods for themselves because there are more options. The and teaching methods are quite different . According to foreign experts, Secondly, people can improve their foreign language, they can contact with when they are in a foreign country, and they quickly master the foreign language. Thirdly, it helps to promote the mutual understanding between their mother land and their destination countries. These students exchange information with the locals. Students can get better understanding of the countries. People in their home country will get more vivid information about other countries . Similarly, the locals also can get more clear recognition about other countries.On the other hand, there are disadvantages too. Firstly, it costs people a lot of money to begin college in foreign countries. Many families have to take out all their savings to support their children abroad. Secondly, some students cannot stand the big difference the new environment, they quit their study and come back home.To conclude, given the fact that in foreign countries helps students with their studies and promotes the mutual understanding countries, even if there are some drawbacks, I think the benefits outweigh the problems.; One of the advantages of studying abroad is the opportunity to learn about other cultures and educational systems. In my opinion, the benefits of this development outweigh the drawbacks. Students gain invaluable experience that makes them more flexible and worldly. Interaction with diverse peers encourages creativity and innovation and enriches the learning environment. Students are challenged by the demands of a new setting and learn to think independently, developing not only self-confidence but also problem-solving skills that will serve them well throughout their lives. In addition, studying abroad often leads to personal growth and maturity. On the other hand, studying abroad is not without its difficulties: there are issues of cultural adjustment, homesickness and the financial strain. On the other hand, the friendships that develop with other international students can also be a lifelong network of valuable contacts. In addition, many schools and universities offer support services, such as counselling and international offices, to help with the transition. Despite the challenges, the benefits of studying abroad, in terms of academic performance, personal growth and future employment prospects, are substantial. This is especially true as the world becomes more interconnected. As such, it will continue to be a valuable educational experience for students who seek a more comprehensive education.
1305;Everybody today should pay a small amount from their income in order to help people who are homeless and / or suffering great poverty. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Homelessness and poverty is a terrible but topical issue in both more economically advanced and less industrialised countries. To deal with this, many people feel that a small proportion of everyone’s income should be used to aid the homeless and poor. This could create more opportunities and change the lives of many disadvantaged people for the better.Though there are certain facilities such as shelters and soup kitchens to aid the poor and homeless, it is clear that this is not enough. In the U.S. alone, a very developed country in itself, nearly two million people are homeless. These facilities can lend a helpful hand; however, they do not help eradicate the problem. Those people who are homeless or poor can have trouble finding jobs, or, if they are lucky to gain employment, the pay may not be enough to support them and their families.If a small percentage of everyone’s income was used to help build more aid facilities and fund organisations to help the homeless and poor, the suffering of many people could be alleviated. However, this is not a perfect world, and taxes are high enough for many people. A similar argument could be that a portion of the taxes already paid to the government should then be set aside for this cause, but of course government funds are usually stretched to breaking point as it is, as governments have so many financial responsibilities already.Though the fundamental idea that people should pay a small percentage of their income to help the homeless and poor is admirable, it is unlikely that enough people would agree to it. People need all the money they earn after taxes anyway and, although governments already have too many calls on their available funds, in my view they should prioritise support payments for the homeless."; The question whether everybody should contribute a small amount from his / her income to help people who are homeless and / or suffer great poverty is one of the most controversial and relevant questions in the world. In my opinion, everybody should help with this, because the benefit of this will be great for society as a whole. I think that everyone should help in this, because the sum of individual effort will lead to a strong positive effect for society as a whole. Moreover, small payments, especially for shelters, food programs, mental health services and employment projects, will be able to accumulate to significant funds. In addition, the sense of solidarity that people feel when they support their vulnerable members in society will strengthen them, and this will inevitably lead to an increased willingness to respond with more resources and effective measures. In addition, reducing the cost of the homeless and the poor can reduce the costs of medical care, police, and emergency services, for example, by investing in prevention, such as housing-first policies, we can save long-term costs for the state and taxpayers. Secondly, supporting the needy can also have a positive economic effect. It is clear that such a voluntary and collective monetary contribution from the general population can be a practical and moral way to deal with homelessness and poverty. However, it is necessary to establish fair and transparent systems for collecting and distributing this money, and it is important that the organizations that collect the money be reputable and proven, and the money is effectively used and reaches the people who need it most. . As the saying goes, ‘it takes a village to raise a child.’ It is also true that everyone should help in this, because we will be able to raise the quality of life of the whole community by promoting kindness and investment in the community.
1407;Financial education should be a mandatory component of the school program. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;In many countries the discussion about financial education getting more serious due to financial problems of young generation. Some people that financial education should be considered a mandatory subject at school.The common problem for those young people is that they don’t know how to spend money in right way. As we can see many advertisements often carry out the message, “Only 10 dollars a week, no deposits” which is misleading think that living in debt is normal. Financial education is one of the solutions for . The basic idea of financial education as a core school subject is to teach those young ones to understand the concept of using money and to estimate a risk of borrowing money to buy something in the future.However, another factor we need . In my opinion, the role of financial education is getting more important and it should be a part of the school program but the parents are also important and have responsibility to how to manage the money. More than 70% of young people’s money is from their parents. In addition, it has to be considered that a student might become person, talking about money all the time in class or even in a public place. It can be harmful for some students and affect their normal social life.In conclusion, I that financial education will have a positive effect on all young ones and other such social commutations should be considered just as important as financial education.; Firstly, students should have a good financial education to help them make sound financial decisions. Today, when economics is so complicated, financial education is not only beneficial but necessary for managing financial responsibilities and challenges. For example, knowing about credit scores and how they affect their future helps students to avoid debt and build a solid foundation for their financial future. Understanding the budget and interest rates, students learn to manage their money in a responsible manner. Learning how to manage their money can help them to avoid the pitfalls of their financial future. Secondly, as financial scams become more common and financial products become more complicated, financial education is becoming more important. If they do not have enough knowledge, they may become victims of financial scams or make poor investment decisions that may affect their financial stability. In addition, a financially literate population is more likely to make positive contributions to the economy, as each individual spends, saves, and invests wisely, which contributes to economic growth and stability. Moreover, the benefits of early financial education not only benefit individuals, but also contribute to the prosperity of society. To achieve this goal, financial education should be introduced to schools from an early age. This will not only prepare students for adult life, but also lead to a more informed and responsible society.
1404;Full time university students spend most of the time studying. They should be doing other activities too. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Full time study in university is a great experience in life but in parallel to that students other activities such as working for their pocket money, sports, participating in debates and . People differ in their opinion if students must in other things or stay concentrated on their studies only. The discussion will be presented below, followed by my opinion.Some people say that mere studying does not youth for a country. This way, students only earn theoretical knowledge not practical. For instance, students can be their studies but at the same time when they , they fail and cannot develop their confidence and work as brilliantly as they were in university. Hence, the best approach for them to be engaged here and there for practical experience.On the other hand, others believe that building a better career is the foremost thing in today’s world. So, they are targeted to their studies and gain as much knowledge as they can. Furthermore, if they are diverted from their studies, they will not be able to their .In my point of view, there must be blending of full time education and extra activities. It refreshes students’ minds and provides more energy . Moreover, by this way, they will learn how to with other people in the society.To summarize, it can be said that it is important to concentrate on but on the other hand there must be something to keep active and relaxed being involved in games, music, work and other extra activities.; First of all, it is not possible to overestimate the importance of extra-class activities. It is true that the primary purpose of university is to obtain knowledge and a degree, but I strongly believe that students must engage in activities outside the course of study to enrich their university life and their personal development. If a student is involved in a student group or plays a sport, he develops social, leadership and time management skills, which are qualities that are in great demand in the labour market and give the student a broader education than what is available in the classroom. I think that students who participate in extra-class activities learn much more than they do in the classroom. Furthermore, it is very important for students to take part in activities outside the classroom, so they can relieve their stress, form friendships and get to know their time and effort more efficiently. The pressure of university work can lead to burnout and insufficient work-life balance. And finally, extra-class activities give students the opportunity to explore their interests and develop them. For example, a student who volunteers at a local non-governmental organization may develop a passion for social justice, which may have an impact on his career. In the real world, it is not just academic knowledge that is required to succeed, but also social and emotional skills. Accordingly, the broader education not only develops the personal and professional skills of students, but also enhances the university experience and prepares students for their careers and life outside the university. In conclusion, for full-time university students, studying is not enough, and it is important to participate in extra-class activities.
1293;Having a salaried job is better than being self-employed. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;If one wants to work for money, there are really only two options, working for someone else for a salary and being self-employed. Most people are involved with these two options and they both have advantages and disadvantages.Being self-employed means that the worker owns the business that is being done. This might be a small one-person business or a large company with hundreds of employees. The first advantage of this is the capacity to earn more money. If the business does very well, the income can be considerable and the owner of the company will receive the benefits. On the other hand, if business is not good, the owner’s income will be low. Self-employed people also have the benefit to some extent of choosing their working hours and holidays and they have the right to change anything within their business. With this autonomy, however, comes the pressure to succeed and the reliance on one’s employees, if there are any, to do their best to make the business thrive.Salaried workers do not experience the same stress as the self-employed owners of companies. They might have stress in their duties, but the pressure that comes with keeping one’s own business operating successfully in order to support oneself and one’s family is just not felt by an employee. The employee also has a certain knowledge of his or her income, as the salary is usually fixed every month. The self-employed owner’s income often depends on how successful the business is. The employee’s fixed income, however, does not give much scope for earning large amounts more. In addition, an employee does not have the freedoms of the owner or the autonomy, and for many people, having control over their lives is a significant factor to their well-being.It is certain that there are advantages and disadvantages for both being self-employed and salaried. I personally disagree that being salaried is better than being self-employed. I prefer the autonomy that being self-employed brings and, although there is more risk and pressure, this can lead to greater and more fulfilling rewards.; On the whole, a salaried job has a stable income, but the cons of being self-employed are also quite strong. As a matter of fact, salaried jobs have more advantages than disadvantages. It is very difficult for people who are self-employed to live in peace. The income of the self-employed is unpredictable. It is difficult for people to live in peace. The work of the self-employed is very unsteady. For example, during the Covid epidemic, many employees still enjoyed job security and received some benefits, but self-employed people were in trouble and couldn't get by. Salary jobs often have health insurance, retirement plans, and paid leave that are independent of the self-employed, so they have more safety, which is especially important in a bad economy. The other is that the working hours of the employees are more regular, so the employees can live a good work-life balance. The self-employed are under great pressure and work at odd hours, and it is difficult to control their work-life balance. If you want to choose your own career, you can take the above factors into consideration, and choose a way that is in line with your own life and value orientation.
1339;High-rise vs. low-rise buildings, which solution is better for a growing population?;Some cities create new housing for their growing populations by constructing a smaller number of high-rise buildings. Other cities create more of low-rise buildings. Which solution is better, in your opinion?Sample EssayRising population in urban areas leaves governments with no choice but to build more houses to meet the demand. However, when it comes to construction, there is more than one way to build new homes. Some cities prefer to construct fewer residential towers, while others build a larger number of low-rises for their residents. In this essay both options will be discussed and a viable solution will be suggested.One advantage of tall buildings is that they can accommodate a large number of people while having a small footprint. This type of construction is popular in central city areas where land is scarce and expensive. For example, in New York City high-rise buildings have significantly reduced housing problems, by as much as 55% in the last few years. As a result of this strategy, rents tend to decrease which has a further positive impact on the economies of such cities. However, tall buildings offer little or no privacy, they force certain rules and regulations upon residents, and attract higher maintenance costs.Given a chance to voice their opinion, many individuals would prefer to live in low-rise buildings or even build their own houses. This option might be more attractive for big families and for older generation people who like to have their own personal space. Accessibility is also a concern for the elderly as taking the stairs when the lifts break down may not be an option for them. In addition, one or two-story houses are easier and cheaper to maintain compared to modern apartment towers. The downside of this type of dwellings is that they occupy much more land, and since land is cheaper on city fringes, new estates tend to be built away from city centres. This increases commute time to work for their residents and negatively affects their quality of life.In conclusion, high-rise and low-rise buildings have their unique advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, high rises are more suitable for younger residents and should be built in the areas where young population is prevalent, closer to the city centre and employment opportunities. Senior citizens should have a supply of lower dwellings available in quieter locations. Such flexible approach can be a good way to address the needs of growing city’s population.; High-rise buildings often dominate the city and can accommodate more people in less space. Each solution offers advantages and disadvantages that depend on the context, which includes geography, economic conditions and social conditions. High-rise buildings not only optimize space but also promote economic activity, as they often contain both residential and commercial units. These buildings can also offer a sense of community by providing shared facilities such as gyms and roof gardens. This vertical solution is particularly advantageous in densely populated cities where land is scarce and expensive. On the other hand, low-rise buildings are usually better integrated into the existing urban fabric, promoting walkability and public space. . However, these buildings are often criticized for their isolation and the possible negative impact on social cohesion. But low-rise buildings require more land and cannot always satisfy the urgent need for housing in rapidly growing cities. As they are lower, they can be more easily adapted to local architectural styles and cultural contexts. In addition, they have a lower impact on the environment in terms of energy consumption for heating and cooling, as well as a greater contribution to biodiversity, eg in the form of green spaces and urban gardens. A mixed solution, combining high-rise and low-rise buildings, can respond to the different needs of different communities, thus ensuring that the city is both well-organized and well-organized. So the question of which solution is better for a growing population does not have a clear answer.
1365;IELTS Essay, topic: Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between the rich and poor, while others disagree (discuss);Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between rich and poor people, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.There is no doubt that modern technology is reshaping our planet and affecting every aspect of human lives. From a social perspective, many people argue that the gap between the upper class and lower classes is widening as a result of technological advancements. Others, however, believe the opposite.There are several reasons why one could think that the wealth inequality is, indeed, increasing. The most common reason is automation. Driven by technology, automation reduces the need for manual labour. As a result, less work opportunities are available for unskilled people. With each iteration of the cycle the competition increases and wages decrease. , technology has increased the minimum level of needs that should be satisfied. Nowadays, everybody should have a mobile phone and an internet connection, including the poor. This increases the monetary burden on them as they must borrow to cover these new needs.However, I firmly believe that the aforementioned opinion is ludicrous. The most obvious reason is that modern technology has facilitated the road to riches in an unprecedented manner. For instance, many of the internet billionaires are from lower and middle classes. Moreover, the major leaps in agricultural technologies magnified food production. As a result, food has become more affordable and available. Finally, leveraging technology has dramatically increased workers’ productivity. Consequently, compensations and salaries have increased.In conclusion, I strongly believe that technology could possibly narrow the difference between social classes. Increased food production, opportunities and productivity are just few examples of technology’s contribution to bridging the wealth gap.This essay adequately covers all parts of the task. The ideas expressed in this written response are relevant, well-developed, ordered in a logical way and supported. The paragraphing is suitable and cohesion is maintained throughout the essay. A good range of vocabulary and the writer’s fluency are evident. There are no spelling errors and very few mistakes in word choice and grammar, most sentences are error-free. The essay is likely to get Band 8 in IELTS.; Those who believe that technology exacerbates inequality argue that access to new technology is not evenly distributed, and that wealthy individuals and families have the financial means to purchase the latest gadgets and use them to increase their production and opportunities. Moreover, in some industries automation and artificial intelligence have facilitated and accelerated the automation of production processes, thus leaving many workers without jobs. Consequently, there is a cumulative effect that the rich get richer, using the best technology to increase their wealth and professional growth, while the poor fall behind without the best technology. The educational gap is also increased, since those who have unlimited access to technology are learning the skills and knowledge needed for employment in a technology-driven economy, while those who do not have access remain disadvantaged. On the other hand, others argue that modern technology can be a great equalizer. The presence of the Internet has democratized access to information and education. Free learning platforms have been created to help people from all backgrounds acquire new skills and knowledge, thereby increasing their mobility. This means that the impact of technology on inequality is complex and depends on how societies are organized and how equitable access to technology is guaranteed. In conclusion, although modern technology can deepen the gap between rich and poor by making them less accessible and replacing human jobs, it can also increase the possibilities for education and economic mobility.
1388;In many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?;Nowadays, many children involved in different types of jobs to have some kind of financial assurance for themselves. However, whether this is good for their development and personality is a controversial issue. I personally believe that paid works is harmful for children for several reasons.It is said that children gain valuable experience in the work place. This may be true. However, I would argue that children are mainly employed in jobs that require manual work and are poorly paid. The recent statistics reveal the common tasks that children are assigned to are washing dishes, mopping floors or serving food in restaurants. Meanwhile, this kind of jobs actually provide children with necessary and useful skills to apply in their future .This brings me to the second point. Defenders of child labour that it is an effective method of learning. The point is children should be able to apply knowledge taught to them in a real life working environment. Although this is undoubtedly true, it also means that children may neglect the classroom study and even fail the class. The worst thing is yet to come. They may become so preoccupied with the benefits ahead of them such as small salary that they may leave school.Finally, supporters say that it helps them to build responsibility in the family. They will understand how it is difficult to earn money and therefore have compassion for their parents. This is true to a certain extent, but may have a totally adverse effect on children. As children can make money at an early age, they would feel that it is appropriate to spend it on luxury things.In conclusion, I think that parents should take measures to restrict their child from work, otherwise it would have negative consequences to their future.;" The children's engagement in work elicits strong opinions on the one hand and on the other. On the one hand, it is regarded as completely wrong and exploitative; on the other hand, it is considered as a valuable work experience. Children are protected from harmful work in accordance with international conventions, such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is unacceptable that children are denied proper education, social development and childhood. In contrast, there are opportunities for part-time, age-appropriate work that can be beneficial for children. The school-age child working a few hours a week in the coffee house may learn many things about life, such as budgeting, customer service and teamwork. It is important that parents, teachers and politicians are responsible for the rights of children while encouraging them to take on responsibilities that will help them develop. On the other hand, it can also lead to a strong work ethic early in life, which can prepare them for the realities of adult life. It is important that the complex issue is managed in such a way that children are both protected and allowed to learn."
1411;In many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it to be a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion on this?;In the Third World, children are usually sent to factories for laborious work. Many people believe that it is merely exploitation, while others think it is a good opportunity for them to life experience. In any case, children have their right to live and study in peaceful conditions. Therefore, using them as workforce is considered an unacceptable action.First of all, children are not workers. They have just learned about the vast world and do not have any experience or concept of working. Since these innocent children are naive and , they can be easily cheated and exploited. There are many examples of this in poor nations. Because using children is cheap and to control, many enterprises hire them and don’t pay them much. Although the government in these countries has tried its best, this kind of taking advantage of children cannot be eliminated.Moreover, children do not need such thing as ‘valuable work experience’ that is supposedly ‘important for learning and taking responsibility’. The brief responsibility of children is learning. They are not old enough to understand what working experiences are. Nevertheless, they can help parents do chores or housework. This will be a much better way for them to become more responsible for . In addition, childhood is one of the most remarkable memories and must not be taken away by forcing them to work.In conclusion, since all children are the great concern of parent and society, they should be allowed to enjoy life and rather than to work. Hence, one must ponder what view is actually appropriate for the sake of the children.; I think that not all kinds of work for children are inherently wrong, but that one must take a lot of care that they are not damaged, but that they can grow up and learn. The debate about child labor is a controversial issue, and there are very different opinions about how it affects children. Some believe that it is a violation of children's rights and that it hinders their development, others believe that it is an important opportunity to learn and take on responsibility. Part-time work, for example, can teach children the value of money, the importance of discipline and how to work with others, and it can help them to become more independent, preparing them for adulthood in a practical way. On the other hand, people who defend child labor often say that it is a good life lesson and that children can learn to be responsible for something that gives them a sense of independence. However, the most important thing is the conditions for working. If work is carried out under safe conditions and does not interfere with education, it can actually be of great benefit. In a society where experience is increasingly important, early work experience can also have a positive effect on future employment opportunities. However, education must come first. On the other hand, working children are exposed to long hours, bad working conditions and no schooling, which is detrimental to children. This balance is important for healthy development and ensures that children can work and still do schoolwork. The child's right to education must not be infringed in any way. It is the task of the state and society to regulate and help so that children can work without sacrificing their education. The well-being and development of children must always be put first, and the right to education must be a priority in the debate on child labor. To conclude, there may be certain forms of paid work that can be useful to children, but they must be treated with caution and responsibility.
361;In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?;"Money can not buy happiness! Is one of the most famous sayings while talking about finances. It is argued that topics around money, wealth, and poverty are becoming dramatically more frequent between humans in different countries around the world. In my opinion, the extream part of it is a negative development; although, it has some positivities. I will address some of both sides in this essay.Talking about money during the major part of the day might make the person look stingy and this is an attitude that majority of the community would not like, thus, might effect on the person's social life. Moreover, having the same topic in mind all day might lead to an obsession, and as a result, this could lead to a depression because the person might not find the proper way to reach to the financial position that meets their satisfaction, which could lead to depression, or even worse such as going through illegal paths where it could destroy their lives entirely!Nevertheless, the person should be aware of his /her income and spendings and try to enhance their financial position to the best possible way. Also, the inflation that we are currently living and the noticable increase in prices could be a driver for people to talk about money more often.In conclusion, people should not be obssessed in money and to talk with everyone about it all the time. However, I believe that people should discuss this matter in order to benefit from each other, and to find more ways to enhance their quality of life.";" The main reason for this increasing interest in money talk is the growing awareness of social inequalities. In recent years, in many countries, conversations about money have become more and more frequent, especially in daily conversations between people, about their earnings and expenses. This development is due to several reasons, such as the effect of increased costs of living, the great influence of social media, and so on. In a society where financial transparency is becoming more and more desirable, discussing income and expenses gives people the opportunity to compare and understand each other's positions. And this sharing of experiences may foster solidarity between people who are facing similar financial challenges. A common situation can also lead to feelings of inadequacy, envy and competition, which may lead to pressure to conform to wealth and success standards, and could undermine people's mental well-being. On the other hand, although open conversations about money may increase awareness and solidarity between peers, it also carries a certain amount of disadvantage. On the one hand, it may promote transparency and enhance financial understanding; on the other hand, it may foster unhealthy comparisons and strain social relationships. Moreover, the risk of commodifying relationships also arises as relationships may become more commercial and less based on shared interests and values. On the whole, the best way to manage this complex social development is to maintain a balance between financial transparency and the integrity of personal relationships."
671;In many countries women and men are working full time. It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;I strongly agree with this statement. If women and men are both working full time, they should share household works.First of all, if women and men are working full time, and they are working in the same amount of time, logically, the amount of time they do household works should be the sam e. However, if one of them work for longer hours, the household works should still be shared but the other one should do more household works.Second of all, everyone have responsibility to do household works because everyone lives in the house, makes the house dirty, creates dirty clothes and dishes. If there is only either women or men doing household works, it is not fair at all, because they both work full time.But as I mentioned before, the amount of time doing household works can be arranged, it doesn't have to be evenly shared. For instance, if the woman in this family work for longer hours or got an extra call by work, the man should help and do her part of household works. And when the man are working more, the woman should do the same. This does not only solve the problem of who should do household works but can also show that women and men are supporting each other in various situations.In conclusion, when women and men are both doing full time jobs, they should share household works. But it doesn't have to to be split in two halves, it can have alternatives depending on the working hours or special situations. In this way, the house can be more peaceful and have more harmony without arguments about who should do the household works.; This essay argues that the share of housework is not only logical but also necessary to maintain a balanced and harmonious home environment. As a result of the gender relations in the labor market, many discussions have been initiated on the division of labor in the home. To share the work is important to maintain a sense of partnership in the relationship, enabling both partners to feel appreciated, respected and involved in their home lives. First of all, the concept that women should be primarily responsible for the household is becoming outdated, and it is therefore necessary that men take part in the household tasks. Then, it sets an example to future generations that both men and women can do well both in the workplace and at home. Secondly, the share of household tasks promotes gender equality in the home, which is important for challenging and changing the stereotypes that reproduce the traditional gender roles in society. Research shows that homes where the work is shared equally have higher satisfaction and fewer conflicts, demonstrating the positive effects of shared work on relationships. In conclusion, it is clear that the division of household tasks between a working couple cannot be overstated. As both partners have devoted time and energy to their careers, they must also devote an equal amount of time to their homes. This new model not only promotes mutual respect between the couple, but also allows individuals to follow their dreams without being limited by outdated gender expectations. At the same time, they create an environment of respect, balance and equality that contributes to a good life in both family and society.
1343;In many countries young people start living on their own after high school, is this a positive or negative development?;In many countries around the world young people decide to leave their parents’ home once they finish school. They start living on their own or sharing a house with friends. Is this a positive or a negative development? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples.Sample EssayNowadays it is becoming increasingly common for youngsters to start their independent life by moving out of their parents’ home after graduation from school. This trend has positive effects on the society and the reasons behind it will be discussed next in this essay.There are various benefits for both young people and their parents when individuals start living independently after finishing school. Young adults, in this way, have to take care of their daily needs, from house chores, cooking or cleaning to financial independence. Thus, instead of wasting time on childish activities, they are motivated to learn skills and work part-time or full-time in order to cover their living expenses. Although it might seem challenging for them to live on their own at first, it would give them valuable experience, helping them to become mature, responsible adults. Parents would also be pleased with this practice since they can enjoy their own lives by having more time for themselves. Not only would they have more financial flexibility due to independence of their children, but they also don’t have to change their habits in order to adapt to the new generation’s lifestyle. For instance, it allows many people to travel around the world, which would be impossible if their children were to stay with them after finishing high school.Admittedly, there might be some challenges involved in this way of life. In some cases and especially under the influence of new friends or housemates, youngsters might choose to get involved in dangerous activities that involve drugs or petty crimes. However, instead of keeping their children close through adulthood, parents should prepare in advance and raise their children to distinguish between right and wrong and teach them to take responsibility for their actions.In conclusion, although there might be some adverse consequences to this relatively new practice, I believe that the advantages of young people leaving family home outweigh its drawbacks, for both children and parents.; You may find that this trend has both positive and negative aspects, depending on the context and individual circumstances. Living on one's own can lead to personal development and maturity. The phenomenon that young people in many countries start to live on their own after graduating from high school is becoming increasingly common. Independence is often followed by increased responsibility. The opportunity to acquire basic life skills such as budgeting, cooking and time management, is invaluable for successful adult life and can strengthen self-esteem and self-confidence. A positive, but also difficult, side of the decision to live alone early is that young people who have this opportunity learn to manage their time, prioritise, and take responsibility for their actions. Also, moving away from home too early may result in loneliness and isolation as young people are often far from the support and security they were used to. The strain on young people’s finances can also be a concern, especially as they are often unable to manage their expenses and this can lead to increased financial difficulties, stress and even debt. In conclusion, whether it is a positive or negative development for young people to start living on their own after high school depends to a large extent on individual circumstances and on the context. While it can contribute to personal development and maturity, it can also present challenges which some young people may not be able to meet.
1320;In many countries, a lot of food is wasted. Why do people waste food? How can we reduce the amount of food waste?;"Despite the fact that millions of people in the world go hungry every day, a surprisingly large amount of food gets wasted daily in certain parts of the world. In my opinion, the main reason for this is that people in the first-world countries tend to only buy food that is aesthetically pleasing, and fortunately, there are some ways to tackle this issue.It is shockingly sad to know that large amounts of perfectly edible food in the form of fresh produce get sent to landfills, and the main reason for this is that these foods do not meet the standards of perfection set for fruits and vegetables by consumers and grocery stores. For example, veggies and fruit that are misshapen or have a few spots on them are still good enough to eat, yet they are often left on shelves to rot in favour of something that looks less damaged. In addition, a lot of customers confuse the ‘best by’ and ‘use by’ dates, thinking that foods that have passed their ‘best by’ dates are no longer fit to eat. Another major reason for food wastage is that people often overestimate the amount of produce they require on a weekly or monthly basis, and most of it ends up getting thrown out instead of being used.There are many ways to reduce the amount of food being wasted, and I think one of the best ideas is to increase people’s awareness of just how much good food is disposed of, only because of our superficial biases as to how food should look. Raising the awareness of the staggering number of people that go hungry in third-world countries would make it harder to throw away an apple just because it is a little bruised. Also, teaching people how to better plan their monthly food requirements would help them not to overspend on food that they do not need; it would be great for the environment and their budget. The role of the government in this endeavour is indispensable as such task would be too great for any smaller organisation.To conclude, the wasting food is a serious issue that merits increased awareness from both people and the leaders of the world. It is unacceptable to discard any food when there are so many people who are starving, and hopefully our joint effort can help improve the current situation."; There are many reasons why people waste food. One of them is the mentality of over-purchasing. People often buy more food than they really need, for example because of special offers or offers. Food waste is a problem that many countries all over the world face and affects not only the economy but also the environment and society. Culture plays a role in this because some societies have the tradition of large portions and a beautiful presentation and throwing away leftovers is commonplace, not leftovers. Also, ignorance of the difference between a best-before date and a use-by date leads to throwing out good food. The solution to the problem is first of all to educate people. Various authorities and organizations can do this with awareness campaigns about storing food, storing it and understanding best-before and use-by dates. Next, policy changes can promote better food management. For example, grocery stores could sell 'imperfect' fruits and vegetables at a lower price, encouraging people to buy products that are still fresh but not according to the aesthetic standards of the trade. By giving consumers knowledge of how to handle the food, they could prevent food waste. Finally, the strengthening of food distribution systems could also reduce food waste. For example, food banks and homeless shelters could be able to facilitate the transfer of unsold food from the grocery store and the producer to the needy so that the unused food does not go to waste, but can be used for a good cause. In addition, restaurants could make it possible to order smaller portions so that there are fewer leftovers. With education, policy changes and better food distribution, food waste can be reduced considerably and the food system can be made more sustainable. In conclusion, food waste is a serious worldwide problem, partly caused by the mentality and culture of consumers.
1331;In many countries, young people are finding it harder and harder to find permanent jobs. Why is this happening? What can be done to improve the situation?;In this fast-moving age, with the development of education and modern technologies, people strive to have a secure job after graduating from colleges and universities. Despite their efforts, so many young adults in different parts of the world have a negative experience of finding a long-term job.It so happens that most colleges and universities focus on students’ academic performance much more than their practical skills. Unfortunately, many companies reserve permanent job opportunities for experienced applicants because there is no need to invest much in their training. Lack of practical experience in new graduates puts them at a disadvantage as far as companies are concerned. The situation is made worse by the abundance of advanced technologies that can easily replace human labor. Robots and computers work more efficiently and with higher precision than humans. That shrinks the pool of available job placements even more, as companies only need to hire highly educated and experienced staff.Fortunately, there is a number of solutions that can help inexperienced workers gain permanent employment. An obvious one is that universities could offer internships to their students, or arrange workshops in addition to classwork. This would help students to get training and experience in their respective fields. Also, the government could examine the demands of changing labor market and steer young people towards professions that will be popular in the coming years. Together with colleges and universities the government could create special awareness programs for graduates, providing them with an overview of various job offers and their benefits. This way students would be able to choose the right jobs for themselves.To sum up, lack of demand in the labour market and insufficient experience are two major reasons why many young people have trouble finding a permanent position. Helping them gain hands-on experience as part of their studies and educating them about career options early on is key to improving the employment outcome for them.; Those who work in a job know very well that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a permanent job. This is due to the fact that the job market has changed drastically in recent years due to changes in the economy, education and the introduction of new technology. The introduction of robots has eliminated many simple jobs, and the disappearance of such jobs has further reduced the number of jobs that were previously available for young people. In addition, the globalization of the economy has opened up new markets and competition, which has led to a tendency for companies to seek experienced and educated workers instead of young, untrained ones. As a result, there are fewer jobs that have historically provided a path to permanent employment for young people, and that is why many young people find themselves in a difficult situation. In addition, it is important to mention the role of the educational system in this situation. In many cases, the gap between what is taught in schools and what is needed in the labor market has increased, and young people find it difficult to meet the new requirements of the labor market, especially in the technical areas. To improve this situation, several measures can be taken. First, the educational system must establish closer links with the labor market so that the curriculum reflects the requirements of the labor market. The lack of a match between qualifications and job requirements increases the difficulties that young people face in finding permanent jobs. First of all, this can be done by increasing vocational education and internships, and secondly, the government can introduce incentives for companies to hire young people by offering tax incentives or subsidies for apprentices. Thirdly, governments can introduce measures to encourage young people to become entrepreneurs and thus create their own opportunities and contribute to the development of the economy. Finally, while the challenges faced by young people in the job market are considerable, a combination of reforms in the educational system, the support of the government and the encouragement of entrepreneurship can help to improve the situation and create opportunities for young people.
1318;In many workplaces online communication has overtaken face to face meetings. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?;In today’s ever-increasingly digital world, online communication has become the norm for many workplaces. While this development offers numerous advantages for companies such as greater flexibility and efficiency, it also brings with it certain disadvantages like miscommunication, which must be weighed against its benefits.One of the primary advantages of online communication is that it makes it easier for teams to stay in touch without having to physically convene. This is especially beneficial when individuals or groups are dispersed across vast distances. Reduced travel costs, as well as time saved from not having to travel to and from meetings, also represent meaningful savings for businesses. Additionally, online communication platforms often have a range of features designed to make collaboration more efficient, such as providing an easy way to share documents and other materials with remote team members. To illustrate, digital resources can be sent quickly and securely via email or other software services like Dropbox or Google Drive.There is a potential drawback associated with relying too heavily on online communication at work, as the lack of physical proximity between members of a team can often lead to misunderstandings due to a loss of context or nonverbal cues that would otherwise be present during face-to-face meetings. However, in my opinion, issues of this nature can be solved by using written language more carefully to avoid any confusion or miscommunication among colleagues.In conclusion, when online communication tools are used properly, they undoubtedly provide companies with greater flexibility in how their teams collaborate without sacrificing clarity of communication, quality or efficiency.; I agree with the statement that there are considerable advantages to this trend, but it is also important to take into account the disadvantages. In recent years, the development of online communication has led to the end of face-to-face meetings in many places. This shift, accelerated by the technological revolution and the pandemic, has radically altered the way people work together and the way they communicate with each other. The changes are primarily positive, for they contribute to a more diversified and open working environment, where diverse groups can easily work together, which brings a wealth of new ideas and new perspectives. One of the greatest advantages of online communication is its easy availability. One does not have to travel to communicate with colleagues, and therefore saves time and money. Also, the ease of organizing meetings between different time zones facilitates communication and collaboration. In addition, many online communication tools offer screen sharing and real-time collaboration, which increases the efficiency and productivity of the employees. But it also brings considerable disadvantages. The lack of physical contact hinders the development of personal trust and working relationships between colleagues. Also, the lack of social contact can sometimes hinder the establishment of a working group. In addition, the constant access to digital communication can lead to a high level of stress, which can lead to poorer health and employee satisfaction. In conclusion, although online communication brings considerable advantages, such as the availability of different time zones and increased efficiency, it also brings challenges, such as the lack of personal contact and health issues for the employees. Keeping the two methods in balance may be the key to their benefits, suggesting that although the increase in digital communication is a good thing, a hybrid solution that combines both methods would be the most complete solution. It is possible that this approach, carefully implemented, will take advantage of the advantages and alleviate the disadvantages of this development.
713;In many workplaces, online communication is getting more common than meeting face to face. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?;According to COVID-19 event forced many company to change their way of working. One of the most significant transformation is the communication. The online communication becomes a must or inevitable for the company to be implemented. In this topic, we're going to disscuss the advantages and disadvantages for both ways of communications. The online meeting can introduce a significant impact to the organization while face to face meeting can be outdated for this new era of 2021.First of all for the online communication's advantages is that in the pandemic period the actual physical contact is a significant way to transmit the disease. Video conference can help mitigate this problem by lower the physical contact for each conversation or meeting. Also communicates through online channel can help individual to organize or manage their time efficiently according to each person preference. For example, a single mom parent may be able to spend times for her sons/daughters at home, while be able to have a cross country meeting with another department in other region. Another reason is that some people are quite introvert and find it difficult for face to face human interactions or conversations, in which online chat or messages can help them to mitigate this problem and communicate efficiently. Lastly as mentioned about video conference across region, online meeting can help the multi-national corporates save the transporations cost and additional resources needed to spend for face to face meeting.For the disadvantages, all of the online communications required hardware, internet connection and technological knowledge on how to use them. This technological gap can be seen as one of the most significant obstracle or disadvantage for people to use online communications. For example, in one company, there obviously have a various age of people, in which some of them are not familiar with the technology. Since video call conference has been introduced and utilized widespread among corporates not so long time ago. This can be a big technological gap for some people to use the online communications and result in a lost in communications among the workplaces.As a result, online communication helps an organization to reduce the risk of transmitting the disease, improved the time mangement ability and productivity for each individuals, and lower the financial cost or resources required to spends for international business activities. With all these advantages of online communication stated, they can be seens as a significant reasons to outweight the disadvantages of technological gap on this current year of 2021.; After a quick assessment of the pros and cons, the following picture emerges: The rise of digital communication has become a defining characteristic of modern professional environments. The advantages of this shift outweigh the disadvantages. Workers are now able to work together more efficiently due to their increased availability and the fact that information can be sent and received in a timely manner. Another advantage of this shift is that it is convenient. It allows employees to communicate with each other no matter where they are and allows teams to work in different time zones. This is also more cost-effective, as there is less need for travel, and thus less need for time. The use of video conferencing, instant messaging and project management has also made it easier for teams to work together and promote a sense of unity and diverse perspectives in the workplace. The disadvantages are also worth mentioning. The first is that the lack of a physical presence can sometimes lead to misunderstandings. Another disadvantage is that many digital communication tools have features that make them more convenient to use, such as sharing documents and sharing real-time information. In addition, the impersonal nature of the digital environment can foster a sense of loneliness and prevent employees from getting to know each other. However, the challenges presented by digital communication are not insurmountable. In fact, companies can take steps to overcome these challenges, such as conducting virtual training sessions and organizing occasional retreats. For all these reasons, although there is still a value to be attached to face-to-face communication, especially the benefits of building trust and friendship, the benefits of digital communication, such as convenience, cost-effectiveness and increased collaboration, clearly outweigh the disadvantages in today's rapidly changing professional environment.
1265;In recent years, the family structure has changed, as well as family roles. What are the changes occurring? Do you think these changes are positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In our modern days, families had witnessed a considerable change regarding their structure and the roles of individuals inside it. These changes are mainly the patriarchal structure that was dominating families in the past compared to a more balanced arrangement nowadays. In addition to that, there are more freedom and rights for women in recent years. And I believe its an advantageous development.Fathers used to be the only leaders of the families of past decades, however in recent days mothers had shared the leadership and started taking part in family decisions just like their partners. Also during recent decades women obtained greater deal of their civil rights which allowed them to take different roles from those that were common for females in the past decades. As an example, women can now own the family house, sign important documents, drive cars which were a breakthrough for women to be able to participate in family plannings and decisions.It appears to be an advantage to have women being able to be effective members of their families, that is because they can share responsibility, add their feminine qualities to the lives of their families as well as for them to be able to fulfill their own life by feeling the importance of their existence and their roles.As in a recent research that found families with women in them are happier, more content, and definitely healthier.In conclusion, the family system nowadays differs vastly from before, owing to the more roles that women are taking, and to the more rights and freedom they gained, and in my perspective it is a positive change.; In recent years, there has been a radical change in the structure and role of families. The so-called nuclear family, with the father as the main provider and the mother as the homemaker, has become a family of many kinds, from single parenthood to a family of many members, including fathers and mothers living together, and families whose members are the same. A change that has occurred is the participation of women in the workplace. With the development of education and careers for women, the separation between men and women in the household has become blurred. This change in family structures can be seen as an expression of changing social norms and values on the relationship between genders, sexuality and individual rights. Another important change is the legalization of the many forms of family, such as couples who live together, families of the same gender, and so on. Many families now depend on the income of both parents to survive. The sharing of roles in childrearing and housework is more evenly divided. Many people argue that these changes can be detrimental to the preservation of family values. However, in my opinion, these changes have a positive impact on families. Not only does this reflect a more inclusive society, but it also enriches the family by providing a wide range of parenting styles and parenting methods, which can result in children who learn to appreciate and respect differences, and it can help to create a more peaceful and cohesive society. Statistics have shown that children from non-nuclear families are more empathetic and more socially aware than children from traditional families. The changes in family structures and the sharing of household chores can promote equality in families and strengthen family relationships. In conclusion, changes in family structures and roles reflect a progressive society that values diversity, equality and mutual support.
1399;In some countries children have very strict rules of behavior, in other countries they are allowed to do almost anything they like. To what extent should children have to follow rules?;Freedom plays a pivotal role in everybody’s life. We can see in today’s modernized era that nobody likes to be restricted, whether it is a child or an adult. Some people think that there should some strict rules of behavior for children, but I disagree with this statement.that sometimes more restrictions can cause more frustration in children, which leads to many other mental problems as well. they can . Sometimes they feel under pressure, which can be the main reason for their poor performance in their field. In some cases children may insist on doing .In other words we have to look other aspects as well, if we usually ignore our children’s bad habits, then they good human beings in their future life. Moreover if we never draw attention the children’s main activities then they might end up in a bad company. They the value of respect for their elders importance of relationships. They their cultural values as well.In a nutshell, I would like to say that children should be the value of their customs, rituals and respect towards their elders for their future life, but most of the additional restriction should . It would good human beings in their future.; It is a very complex question how far children should be ruled, how much and what kind of rules a child must follow, and what effects these rules have on his development, behavior, and personality. To some extent, it is clear that children need rules and limitations to help them develop, but the rigidity and nature of these rules greatly influence a child's behavior, personality, and character. Having too many rules and restrictions often gives a child a feeling of disorder, as well as a feeling of a routine, but also a sense of responsibility and organization. In countries where discipline is valued, children are taught from a very young age to respect, obey, and work. In contrast, in countries where freedom is valued, children are encouraged to explore and experiment. A too rigid environment can limit the child's creativity, self-expression, and self-determination. In general, a combination of both is the best: children should certainly follow the rules that ensure their safety and well-being, but the opportunity to be independent and to grow up should also be given. Children who are given the opportunity to express their ideas and feelings can build self-confidence and self-esteem. In short, how much children should be ruled depends on the child's age, character, and cultural background. Children should be given freedom within limits so that they can find their own way, but still feel protected and guided.
681;In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development;Nowadays, many businesses have to compete each other in order to survive from the rapidly changing world, leading to the high amount of time that employees spend on working. There are also other reasons why the employees work for a long period which I will discuss in this essay. In terms of consequences, I personally believe that spending most of our time at work is the negative development.It is the fact that people have various rationales to work for long hours. A classic example is the dynamic working condition. There are many companies that provide services such as consultation to customers, meaning that if their service does not completely satisfy the clients’ need, such client may decide to use the service from other competitors. Hence, the employees are required to dedicate their time to deliver the best service to the clients. Another common criticism is a bright career path. When the employees work for a long period, they can carefully check their works and, as a result, delivery the works with less mistakes. Doing this way could impress their manager and they are likely to get promotion in return.With a careful consideration regarding the consequence of working for long hours, there are many vital drawbacks. An obvious effect is the increase in illness. People who work very hard have to spend a lot of their time at work. Therefore, they may not have enough time to do exercises, weakening the immune system of their body. Furthermore, with the rise in the amount of working hours, people tend to lack social skills. This is because they may not be able to manage time to join social events or meet their friends, resulting in the less ability to adapt to new environments.In conclusion, it is undeniable that people work for long hours because of the requirement in business and personal career goal which, in my opinion, leads to negative development for themselves. This is because this behavior negatively affects their health condition and social competency which are the two most important aspects in our life.; In a number of countries, especially in rapidly developing economies or in economies with high competition, people work long hours. This phenomenon can be explained by many interrelated factors, including cultural expectations, economic needs, and the conduct of companies. In the first place, it is the basic cultural principle of the people that work is equated with success and personal importance. In the second place, the work-life balance problem is often exacerbated by the economic environment: the fear of job loss and career advancement can make people work longer hours. In the third place, longer working hours can increase the productivity of companies, allowing them to increase their production and thus increase their profits, which will then contribute to macroeconomic growth and international competitiveness. The implication of long working hours is both positive and negative. On the one hand, excessive work can lead to fatigue, low morale and poor health, both physically and mentally. Long hours of work can also lead to career advancement, which will subsequently lead to higher wages and job security. On the other hand, while long working hours can contribute to productivity and economic growth, they also create a serious imbalance between employee well-being and life satisfaction. Family and personal relationships are also affected, resulting in a decline in life quality and thus a general social problem. This is why it is important to encourage a balance between work and family life to ensure a sustainable and happy workforce.
101;In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .;Over decades, there has been a belief that adults should support adolescents to work in a company or travel to another country at least one year before going to university. Despite the fact that there are many positive aspects of having experiences in terms of working and travelling before studying at university, with a careful consideration, there are also negative points of this.It is true that working or travelling before starting a university program positively affects juveniles’ development. A classic example of this is an effective way to truly understand their academic preferences. When juveniles have work experiences, such as having a one-year internship in a company, they tend to learn a wide variety of work functions, helping them know the academic discipline they want to learn at university. Another benefit from taking a long journey to another place before studying at university is the opportunity to get exposed to new culture. This is because while adolescents are on an epic expedition to other parts of the world, they tend to meet new people with different nationality and belief, leading to valuable life experiences that they cannot receive from a professor at university.In spite of the aforementioned advantages of working or travelling before starting university courses, there are also drawbacks. A common example of this is graduating from a college late, compared to juveniles who immediately start a university program after they finish high school. This is exemplified by Thai culture which believes that young people who graduate from university later than their peer would not have a successful career path. In addition, opponents of this notion might argue that working before finishing university is not well worth doing. Since most works require a strong academic foundation in order for juveniles to deliver results with fewer mistakes, the juveniles should study at university instead.In conclusion, it is undeniable that having work experiences or taking a journey before starting a university life has many benefits for young people with respect to knowing the academic fields they want to study and learning new cultures outside a classroom. Nevertheless, doing this could also have drawbacks in terms of the delay in university graduation and an ineffective performance in working.; The main advantage of a gap year is personal growth. One of the disadvantages is the loss of contact with people, the development of relationships, difficulties in finding work, the fear of socializing, or even not finding oneself in the end. Travelling abroad introduces young people to new cultures, people and different views, and this experience often develops emotional intelligence and flexibility, which are important skills in today's ever-changing world. In addition, young people who engage in working can develop essential soft skills, such as teamwork, communication and leadership, which are useful not only in studies, but also in their future careers. Besides, a gap year provides practical work experience. There are also disadvantages to consider. For example, the possibility of dropping out of the university, which is financially burdensome, may be there. In addition, the unplanned year may lead to a waste of time and resources and interfere with future educational and career goals. In conclusion, while the decision to take a gap year can lead to personal growth and practical experience, it also carries risks that may hinder future studies. Young people should carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of a gap year to ensure that the time they spend is consistent with their long-term goals and ambitions.
1304;In some countries, boys and girls are educated separately after the age of about ten years old. Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;In many countries around the world, boys and girls are educated together. There is a group of countries, however, that educate boys and girls separately. This is frequently done on religious grounds, but not always. Having such a system can produce various advantages and disadvantages.One of the principal reasons for educating boys and girls separately is that, if they are together, they can distract each other. After puberty, boys can be strongly attracted to girls and vice versa, and this can result in disruptive conduct in the classroom as, for example, they show off to one another. Separating boys and girls can therefore have the distinct advantage of reducing this disturbing behaviour. However, some teachers have pointed out that this model does not always work, and that separated boys and girls are equally disruptive in class, and sometimes more so. These teachers say that having the opposite sex in the classroom can actually improve behaviour.Many educators also believe that boys and girls have different learning styles and needs. Separating boys and girls can allow teachers to address these needs more easily. There is also a belief that single sex schools allow gender stereotypes to be challenged and therefore education aspirations can be broadened.A major disadvantage of separating boys and girls in education is that the children miss important formative behavioural development when they do not have interaction with the other gender on a regular basis. This can lead to shyness and, more seriously, dysfunctional relationships later in life. Some people also feel that mixed sex schools can promote gender stereotypes rather than reducing them.In conclusion, I feel that children should be educated all together, although I would respect a system in which they are separated due to religious beliefs. My personal opinion is that different genders should learn to interact together from an early age, as this would allow them to develop healthy working relationships with each other.; There are many countries in the world where boys and girls are educated separately after a certain age. This view has aroused great debate and controversy, as advocates of this idea argue that separate education for boys and girls after a certain age will make for a better learning environment and can lead to greater understanding between the sexes. However, I believe that this may not be the best approach, as it can lead to increased stereotypes between the sexes. These arguments are based on the idea that students will be more comfortable expressing themselves if they are in a segregated environment. For example, they argue that boys learn better from practical, hands-on tasks, whereas girls are better suited to more verbal and group learning methods. While this may be true to some extent, the view ignores the complexity of the relationship between gender and learning. Most educational research shows that differences in learning styles do not relate to gender but to individual personality and interest. In addition, it has been shown that countries where coeducation is the norm, such as Finland, tend to report more progressive and successful attitudes and outcomes for both sexes. In a society that is striving for gender equality, it is important to create an environment where boys and girls learn together. When they do so, they will develop as individuals who are well rounded, accepting of diversity, and more ready to face the challenges of an ever-changing world. In conclusion, although there are good arguments for separating the sexes at an early age, the advantages of coeducation outweigh these claims.
785;In some countries, only few young people go to classical music concerts or or play classical music. Why? Should young people be encouraged to attend and learn more?;Classical music is one of the oldest artistic samples of our history. However, the young people of the new generations do not appreciate this kind of music. I believe that governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and I will support my stand with valid arguments in the following paragraphs.First of all, the main reason behind the little interest of young people in classical music is the impact of globalization in music and arts. That is because people have the opportunity to know more about multiple things without leaving their homes. However, all this knowledge is only superficial and arts, more specifically classical music, is diminished by the big international industry of music. For instance, reggaeton music, despite the fact that its lyrics are often misogynous, is the most popular style of music these days.Another reason is that children and young people have less interest in cultural matters than in the past because governments do not invest in culture and arts. In most countries, investment in culture has been drastically reduced and young people have no access to classical music concerts and much less a musical instrument that has a huge cost. Consequently, governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and the arts.To summarise, this essay has examined the idea of classical music and why young people do not have an interest in this kind of music. As far as I am concerned governments should take responsibility in this matter and invest more money in culture and classical music encouraging young people to learn more about this kind of art.; Here are some ideas: In recent years, a decline in young people's interest in classical music has been observed in several countries. This decline can be explained by a variety of reasons, and solving them is of the utmost importance if we are to encourage a new generation to appreciate and play this time-honored art form. As for instance perceptions that classical music is elitist and unapproachable, young people might avoid attending classical music concerts or learning an instrument. Another factor is the speed of modern life, which often makes young people prefer to consume entertainment that is easy to understand and easy to digest, thus pushing more complicated and refined works of art to the background. These modern forms of music, with their rhythmic hooks and socially conscious lyrics, appeal to young people and are promoted heavily through social media and streaming services. However, young people should be encouraged to explore the many facets of classical music. They may feel that without prior exposure to it, they cannot understand or participate in it, and this perpetuates a cycle of disinterest. That is why there should be more concert and school initiatives, with the help of modern technology, which can make classical music more approachable and appealing. Finally, there is scientific evidence that exposing young people to classical music can increase their creativity, improve their learning skills, and encourage them to express themselves emotionally. Such benefits should encourage young people to learn about this musical form, so that it can be preserved for future generations.
1334;In the modern world, it is possible to shop, work and communicate with people via the Internet and live without any face-to-face contact with others. Is it a positive or negative development?;The feasibility of shopping, working and communicating through the Internet is gradually eliminating the necessity of in-person encounters. I believe the merits of this opportunity outnumber its demerits and the lowered volume of traffic in addition to the possibility of long-range communication will be discussed as reasons for this claim in this essay.One chief benefit of using the Internet as a means of making purchases, working and communicating would be the lowered demand for transport, through eradicating the need for face-to-face contact. Such decreased volume of transportation would result in fewer harmful gas emissions which could significantly contribute to creating a cleaner environment. Furthermore, reduced commuting burden yields more free time for individuals. It could be spent in various ways such as working, studying and socialising with family and friends to name a few, which would be more productive and enjoyable.Another key merit of using the Internet would be the emergence of state-of-the-art telecommunication applications. These technologies have made it possible for those with access to the Internet to get in touch and send and receive audiovisual content by pushing just a few buttons. This presents a stark contrast to the situation only a few decades ago, when long-distance communication was possible solely through paper-based letters, which could possibly take months to reach the recipient.There are, however, some drawbacks to online communication, in particular the possibility that the lack of contact brought by technological advancements could potentially weaken human bonds. Taking into consideration that humans are sociable species, this could pose a dire threat to our mental health. This predicament, however, would be mitigated by the extra free time technological developments create for us. This free time could be spent with friends and family and in the long run would strengthen our relationships and improve our emotional wellbeing.To recapitulate, the Internet’s demolishing the need for person-to-person contact brings about numerous benefits. A more sustainable environment as well as more free time generated for individuals, a reduced need to commute in addition to the feasibility of conducting long-distance communication in the easiest way possible, are all instances of the above-mentioned merits.; In the digital era, the Internet has made it possible to do almost everything from home, so shopping is easy. However, despite the great convenience, the fear of the negative consequences of a face-to-face existence without the Internet is a major concern. Furthermore, the advancement of remote working technology has enabled professionals to work from home, and geographical barriers have been broken, resulting in a more flexible, dynamic workforce. On the other hand, communication has been transformed, with the rapid development of social media and instant messaging, enabling people to communicate with each other regardless of distance. However, as a result of this trend, there are many disadvantages, and a lack of face-to-face communication can lead to loneliness and alienation. Furthermore, the convenience of shopping and working remotely can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which can have a negative impact on health and well-being. Furthermore, people's social skills may decrease as a result of their reliance on technology, especially among young people, who are less able to deal with real-world relationships. Consequently, while the Internet offers a convenient and easy way to shop, work and communicate, the trend towards a face-to-face existence poses significant challenges. In conclusion, although the Internet has made it easy to shop, work and communicate, the trend towards a face-to-face existence poses a significant challenge. The absence of face-to-face contact can also blur the perception of the local community and lead to a sense of isolation and loneliness.
1344;In the past people wore their traditional clothes, but these days most people wear similar clothes, is this a positive or negative development?;In the past, people wore their traditional clothes and followed their culture. These days, most people wear similar clothes and therefore look very similar to one another. Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?Sample EssayThese days, people’s perspectives on the value of clothing are changing, and individuals tend to wear similar clothing compared to people in the past who opted for their traditional clothing. I believe this tendency exerts a positive influence on the society.It is certainly true that there are some drawbacks to this tendency because it may lead to a loss of global diversity. It can be argued those who wear ordinary clothes such as T-shirts and jeans cannot feel a connection to their roots, and they are likely to neglect their culture and the contribution of their ancestors. Therefore, these people may not take pride in their region, and they might migrate to an urban location rather than contribute to the development of their community. Consequently, many ethnic minorities could suffer from depopulation and eventually disappear.However, I believe that there are more positives than negatives in people opting for similar clothes. The first explanation is that individuals can feel a sense of unity with people all over the world even though they have different religions and ways of life. This would motivate people in the world to support one another, instead of thinking that different parts of the world should deal with their own problems when natural disasters and other terrible problems occur in different nations. Furthermore, this tendency is economically profitable. Generally speaking, as ordinary clothes are automatically manufactured, they can be produced faster and more affordably than traditional clothing such as Japanese Kimono, which is hand-crafted.In conclusion, although people today tend to wear similar clothes instead of traditional ones and this trend cause several problems, I believe that the society as a whole can reap more benefits of this tendency.All parts of the task have been covered. The writer presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt with suitable, widely covered and sufficiently supported ideas. The paragraphing is handled appropriately. The range of vocabulary allows the writer to convey the intended meaning. The overall control of grammar and punctuation is fine, with only a few errors mostly related to word choice (hover/tap on corrections in blue for details). Well done! Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.; As globalization accelerates, more and more people wear similar clothes, especially Western-style clothes, and this phenomenon can be seen in different ways. The transition from the appearance of many people to the appearance of many people is a multi-facetted issue, and it has a positive and negative meaning. For example, in terms of a positive meaning, the commonality of people's clothes can be seen as a unifying factor in an increasingly interconnected world, and it can also achieve equality, so that people are less aware of the different roles that the original clothes play, and thus realize the unity of the community. This unity is beneficial to the community. But there are also disadvantages to this uniformity. The fading of the original clothes may mean the disappearance of culture and the disappearance of history. In addition, the use of new clothes is also practical. For example, they are usually more comfortable and flexible, and they can easily meet the needs of the city. But in terms of culture, this may mean the loss of history, which may lead to the loss of the original culture, especially in the young generation, which can lead to the loss of awareness of history and the loss of knowledge of history. Clothes are often a reflection of the history, beliefs and customs of a certain group of people, and when these elements are lost, the collective memory of the group may also be lost. The importance of these two factors cannot be ignored. In short, the appearance of people in modern society is both an opportunity and a challenge. People should cherish and preserve the original clothes, but they should also try to achieve modernization, so as to keep their history and culture, even though they are living in a uniform world.
641;"Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference. To what extent do you agree or disagree?";There is no doubt these days that the action of the individual is not powerful enough to make the environment better. Unless through laws created by the government and activities have been taken by companies that have a high impact. I strongly disagree with this idea. because there are other ways to help the government as an individual.In essay will prove my point with reasons and examples.Nowadays, people can use social media as a platform that has the power to tell people around the world how to behave. Therefore, an individual has the power to convince others to give higher attention to our environment and create a community that has specific goals to improve. For example, social media influencers could educate the volunteer and work with the youth to make the environment better. For instance, show the young people how to sort the waste and how dangerous the impact is if they do not act in such as way.Moreover, as individuals, people can start doing many actions which benefit the environment by themselves without obstructions. On the other hand, the government and companies should be aware too. For example, while the companies use the factories the government must be monitoring the discharge of fule.In conclusion, after carefully explaining my points of view, in my opinion, it is not necessary to wait for the government and the big companies to act activity for the environment because we as individuals can create and provide educational activities for the public to preserve the environment for the next generation.; The government can make laws and regulations that significantly affect the environment. It is undeniable that laws and regulations can change the whole system, but it is also important to consider the role of individuals in the conservation of the environment. The influence of large companies on the environment is enormous. When they start reducing their own waste or using environmentally friendly materials, they can do a lot for the environment, because their influence is extensive. Governments should establish laws and regulations to reduce emissions, support the development of renewable energy and protect natural reserves. Besides, there are a lot of choices for individuals in their everyday lives, such as recycling, reducing the use of plastic and supporting small and local businesses. Dismissing the importance of individual actions is naive. From history we know that grassroots movements can make an important difference and can move the government to make important changes. It all depends on individual choices, which together have a big impact on the government and companies. We must work together as a society to solve the problems we face in the future.
1237;"Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.";"Pollution free environment is important for our life's health and even enjoyement.Everyone whether an individual or large entitiy has an impact on the environment; regardless whether it was good or bad. Hence, I believe it is the responsibility of individulas as well as governments and large companies.Individuals can do a lot to improve the environemt around them starting with taking some actions to make a difference. For example, every memeber in the sociaty can support recycling efforts by sorting their garbages into different categoreis, instead of wasting the efforts of recycling companies to do so. Another exmaple would be to stop using plastic products and replace them with more environemt friendly products like pepar products.Moreover, teaching and spreading awarness about the importance of keeping our environemt clean are another way to make a difference. For instance, we can use social media to spread awarness and start campaigns about enviorment and pollution. Furthermore, we can teach some classes in schools and universities about this subject. As a result, this will help the upcoming generations to understand the problem and have them continue the efforts of improvement.While individuals efforts are essential, they must be supported by governments and large companies in order to complete the circle. A main example here would be establishing regulations and laws that would minimze the damage to the environment and maintain pollution at low levels, which is the role of the governments around the world. As for large companies, they can support by adopting the best practicies and take the proper actions to reduce pollution and improve the environment. As an example, they can start using clean and renewable energies to power their facilities and plants. In addition, those companies can develop technologies that contributes toward keeping the environment safe, and prompet the use of clean energy and vehicales.To sum up, the responsibility to improve the environemt must be divided between all three parties individuals, governments, and large companies. Each has his role to enhnace the environemnt and reduce the pollution. They complete each other and they should work together toward a better future for our world."; Governments and companies play a crucial role in influencing people’s attitudes to the environment. While there is no doubt that large-scale change is made possible by the combination of government action and private enterprise, to deny the power of individuals would diminish the strength of grass-roots movements and individual responsibility. However, governments and corporations can play a vital role, and this is shown by the fact that they have the resources and power to make a big difference. For example, the Paris Agreement makes it the responsibility of countries to combat climate change through the combined efforts of their governments, and it is clear that a significant change can only be achieved with government intervention. However, individuals must not underestimate their own contribution, as individual choices, such as reducing waste and buying products that are sustainable, all contribute to a larger move towards greater responsibility towards the environment. For example, companies such as Google and Apple are using their power to make a difference by using sustainable energy sources. However, consumer demand also greatly influences the behaviour of companies, so when people want products that are more eco-friendly, companies respond to that demand by becoming more responsible towards the environment. In conclusion, while governments and companies can play a vital role in improving the environment, so can individuals. The increasing popularity of community initiatives, such as the campaign to clean up local parks and the push to encourage greater participation in the collection of rubbish, show that individual action can be just as important. So while it is clear that large-scale change is essential, so is the power of individuals. Individual responsibility combined with the combined power of governments and companies can be the basis of a sustainable future.
1301;It is a fact that the majority of people who are sent to prison commit further crime after their release.What is causing this? What can be done to change this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is a sad fact that criminals who leave prison go on to commit further crime. There are various reasons for this, but there are also some things that can be done to prevent it from happening.One reason for this recidivism is due to a lack of legitimate income. Many people turn to crime as they cannot find an alternative to earn money. When such person comes out of prison, it is very often the case that they have the same few opportunities for a legitimate income. In fact, these opportunities will even be reduced, as employers are often less willing to give an ex-prisoner a job. Some people also return to crime, as they spend all the time of their prison sentence with other criminals. This is not a great environment for rehabilitation, and sometimes even a network of contacts can be made to help develop criminal activities on release.One important way to help address this problem is education. Criminals who have turned to illegal activities because of no alternatives to earn a living need to learn a way to earn a wage, such as a trade or vocational skills. Computer skills, for example, are in high demand and someone trained in these could very possibly find work. In addition, governments can offer incentives to employers to attract them to give jobs to newly-released prisoners. This would help people who don’t really want to return to crime achieve a fresh start. As keeping people in prison is an expensive business, governments might find it cheaper to pay these incentives.To sum up, people returning to crime is a tragedy that should be avoided if at all possible in today’s society. Education and incentives can directly address the reasons for it and could make society a happier and safer place.; The most important cause of recidivism is the lack of support provided for former convicts on their release. This has a number of reasons: insufficient support, insufficient rehabilitation, social stigma, etc. For example, research has shown that people who have found stable work after being released from prison are much less likely to commit another crime. Many people leaving prison have neither house nor work nor money and, without the proper support, they will go back to crime. Moreover, rehabilitation during imprisonment is often insufficient, as many prisons focus on punishment rather than rehabilitation, ignoring psychological and social factors that have led to criminal behaviour. On top of that, prisons often lack work training, so people are released into a job market where they do not know how to behave. Social stigma is also a major problem on their return to society. Convicted people are often viewed with suspicion, which affects their chances of finding a job, accommodation or social acceptance. In this respect, educational and vocational training and support for mental health are vital in reducing recidivism. In order to change this current situation, there needs to be a multifaceted approach combining better rehabilitation in prisons with better support on release, along with greater acceptance of the criminal element by society as a whole. To this end, awareness campaigns and support for reintegration in the community could help reduce stigma and create a more supportive and inclusive society. The success of rehabilitation and reintegration into society depends on the success of these measures.
1336;It is believed that people who read for pleasure develop their imagination more and acquire better language skills compared to people who prefer watching television. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Some people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. Personally, I support this opinion for several reasons, which will be laid out in this essay.As we all know, books use text to convey ideas and quite often there are no images or illustrations to picture the scenes described in the book; therefore, we have to use our own imagination while reading. For example, reading a fantasy novel that contains mythical creatures one would normally see the appearance of those characters in their mind while following the plot. In contrast, movie heroes on a TV screen are usually created for the viewer by directors and producers of the film. Watching TV substitutes the need to develop one’s own imagination because the characters and their surroundings are shown on the screen.Furthermore, it is argued that reading is the best way to expand one’s vocabulary. The reader learns the correct spelling of a word by seeing it printed in a book, and they grasp its meaning from the context, without having to look it up in a dictionary. Not only new words but also numerous sentence structures can be learnt from books. To take advantage of these benefits English teachers in many schools use English novels as teaching materials. Students are asked to read the story and capture the keywords to answer the questions in the exam. In comparison, learning new words while watching a TV show isn’t always easy because the viewer’s attention is drawn to the action on the screen and if there are no subtitles, the spelling of the words is not obvious. All this makes a book a more effective tool for a language learner compared to TV.In conclusion, I believe people who love to read tend to have a more active imagination and advanced linguistic comprehension than those who watch television, since readers are required to imagine the story in the book and learn the meaning of new words from the context."; Reading is much more difficult than watching a television program. The question of whether it is more beneficial to read or watch a television program to develop the imagination and language skills has become a hot topic recently. In reading, one is forced to imagine the place, the character, the feelings that the author describes, and this mental activity stimulates the imagination and develops the imagination. In contrast, on the other hand, a carefully arranged visual story is told on the screen, and the viewer's imagination is limited. The development of language skills in reading books is also a major advantage. Books teach readers a wide range of vocabulary, complex sentence structures, and writing styles. Therefore, people who often read for pleasure often develop a richer imagination than those who are used to visual media. On the other hand, the spoken language used in the film is often more simple and repetitive. Reading a book a day makes people more familiar with the language patterns and makes them more effective in speaking and listening. Moreover, reading can develop imagination and language skills, but watching a film is a passive activity. It does not challenge the viewer to develop his vocabulary and critically analyze the content, and therefore, the development of language skills is limited. In conclusion, I think reading is the best way to develop imagination and language skills. Therefore, it is very important for people to put reading as a priority when using media. People who are more familiar with the literary world are more able to express themselves and be more creative.
753;It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;"Nowadays a lot of primary schools are starting to introduce the teaching of animal care and general agriculture. Many people think that primary children should study and understand how to grow vegetables and keep animals; this essay will discuss why primary school should learn about this two arguments and how the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.It is very important study and understand how to grow vegetables and how to keep animals, especially in a younger age. Most of the kids, that frequent the primary school, have this desire of having a pet and, the opportunity of studying how to take care of it in the school, can make the child more aware of the responsibilities that he will have if, one day, he has to own one of them. At the same time, for a primary children it's also important to understand how vegetables grown and what's the process behind that , learning about this arguments will help the kids to appreciate more the food and, as a consequence, in the future there will be less waste of it .It's clear that the advantages will be more than the disadvantages, if there are any. If every kid will know more about the arguments, the world in the future will become a better place, with more respect for the animals and more appreciation for the vegetables that, will also help people to make a healthier life.In conclusion, this essay discussed on how the introduction of subjects like animal care and general understanding of how vegetables grow, will help the kids to become better adults in the future to make of this world a better place."; For children to be taught how to grow vegetables and keep animals is a very useful idea. Although there may be disadvantages, the advantages far outweigh them and contribute to the development of a well-rounded personality. Children learn about the cycle of life, from sowing to harvesting, and acquire an appreciation of the source of food. Also, looking after animals teaches children empathy and sympathy for other living creatures. Having to feed and care for other living creatures also increases their sense of responsibility and self-reliance. In addition, contact with nature has psychological benefits, reducing stress and improving general health. Furthermore, the physical benefits of gardening and animal husbandry include an increase in physical activity and a reduction in the consumption of unhealthy, commercial food. However, there are also disadvantages, for example, the time and money that is required for looking after a garden or animals. The schools would also have to devote resources to the training of teachers, providing the necessary facilities and taking responsibility for the legal liabilities that might result from keeping animals. These problems can be overcome by careful planning and integration into the school curriculum rather than by being separate activities. For example, schools could establish links with local farms or community gardens and share resources and expertise. The implementation of such a programme would lead to well-developed and responsible individuals, who would be better prepared for life in the future.
1296;It is the responsibility of individuals to save and provide for their own retirement. Governments have no obligation to provide this benefit.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The responsibility for providing funds for retirement is incredibly important and something that is often overlooked by younger people. Some believe it is the responsibility of the individual to plan for this, but others feel it is the responsibility of the state.People who believe that the state should be responsible for funding retirees, base their argument on the fact that in most countries, people pay taxes and social charges to the government. This money, they argue, should also go towards the provision of a pension for the person paying the tax. In addition, those who have very small or no income, pay little or no tax and do not have the ability to provide for themselves. The government, therefore, in its role of caring for the population, has an obligation to pay a pension and provide other social benefits, such as medical treatment.Many others, however, feel that it is the responsibility of individuals to fund their own retirements. As adults, they argue, people should be able to set aside and invest money throughout their lifetime, so that they can retire with few financial worries. In many countries the government has legislated a framework allowing and encouraging citizens to save up and accumulate sufficient funds for the period after their working years have ended.I neither agree nor disagree with the statement, but rather my opinion takes in parts of both arguments. I feel that people should be responsible for saving money to fund their retirement, but I also feel that individuals who have not had the chance to do so should be supported by the government out of taxes. In my view, therefore, it is wrong to say that governments have no obligation to help people in this area. Governments are there to support the entire population of their countries, which includes the poorer elements of society.; I do not deny the importance of personal responsibility in financial affairs, but I believe that governments also have a major role to play in securing a secure retirement for their citizens. This issue of whether the responsibility for retirement is solely that of the individual or whether the government has an obligation to help him is a complex and difficult issue. Personal financial education is important. Individuals should know about their possibilities and take them into account. Many successful professionals, such as doctors and engineers, for example, have their retirement largely provided for by their employers, highlighting the importance of individual action in retirement. Many people suffer from the high cost of living, or they have debts, or medical expenses that prevent them from saving adequately, which means that in many cases the burden of savings is unreasonable. But relying on personal responsibility ignores a series of problems that are not individual but social, such as economic disparity and unforeseen life events. On the other hand, governments can establish regulations that ensure that companies provide employees with reasonable retirement benefits. It is for this reason necessary that governments create systems that provide support, such as social security, pensions and tax benefits for private retirement savings. This balanced approach of personal responsibility and social security will provide a safe future for all citizens. In conclusion, although personal responsibility for retirement planning is important, governments should not absolve themselves from the obligation to provide support systems.
1287;It must be a woman who stays at home to care for children. Men are not suited to this kind of work. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Traditionally in many parts of the world, it has been women who have stayed at home to care for children. This has led to the ideology and expectation that women are more suited to this type of work than men.The overwhelming status quo where women stay at home to care for the children probably derives from the fact that women are the ones who have to actually give birth to children and, following that, they are the ones who for the early part of a child’s life have to feed the child until it is weaned. In times past, this state of affairs probably led to the women assuming the permanent role of carer for the home and children, whilst men went out to work, whether it was to gather food or work in fields or factories.In spite of the fact that this became what was expected in family dynamics, it does not mean that men are necessarily less suited to caring for a child than women. It is very possible for men to care for a child, even from birth onwards in today’s world. Babies’ milk formula can be mixed by anyone and fed to a child. The fact that many women today choose not to do this again does not mean that they are better suited by nature to care for the child.Suitability for childcare is a matter for individual temperament and aptitude. Not many people, whether they are men or women, feel totally confident and knowledgeable about how to care for a baby or young child at the start. They need advice from their own mothers and fathers, midwives or from books. It is only from experience that skill with childcare comes and this skill can be acquired regardless of gender.All in all, I do not agree with the statement that men are less suited to childcare than women. I believe that aptitude to look after children is a matter of individual temperament, not gender-specific inherited qualities.; I strongly disagree with the statement that it must be a woman who stays at home and looks after the children, and that men are not suited to this kind of work. This statement is outdated and misleading. In today's society, gender roles are changing and not necessarily associated with one gender. Firstly, research has shown that the emotional and psychological development of children is much more effective when they have fathers with whom they have developed a close and intimate relationship. For example, studies have shown that children with involved fathers have better social skills, higher IQs and better educational performance. The child's psyche is enriched by having both fathers and mothers. Secondly, traditional gender roles, where caregiving is always associated with women, restrict both women and men from taking on the roles and responsibilities they can do. Many families today function well and have shared care, which means that the care is shared by the father and mother. The fact that men are good at taking care of their children and doing the household chores shows that men are good at these roles and questions the stereotype that caregiving is only the woman's role. For example, there is an increased awareness and acceptance of the importance of fathers' roles in family life. In conclusion, the statement that only a woman can stay at home and care for the children is an outdated concept that no longer corresponds to the realities of today's families. When the fathers take on these roles, they not only show their abilities but also promote the fair distribution of responsibilities in the home. Men and women can both take care of and raise children well. A more egalitarian attitude towards caregiving leads to stronger families, healthier child development and ultimately a better society.
1105;It's generally believed that success in fields such as art and sport can only be achieved if a person has natural talent. However, it's sometimes claimed that any child can be taught to become a good sports person or artist.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"It is common to think that in fields like art or sport success is linked to natural talent, even though it is stated that children can obtain good results also trough learning and pratice.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------In my opinion, I believe that only a combination of natural talent and sacrifice can lead you to obtain success; for this reason, you can learn and improve several skills, but you will not win against a person with this type of gift, unless this person does not pratice enough.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------To provide an example, if we think about Raffaello, one of the most remarkable painters of all times, and his life we may be disappointed; in fact, thanks to his natural talent he started to paint since he was 8.However, we have to bear in mind that he constantly made a research in order to discover new techniques and to gain new inspirations.If he was not so focused on his art's improvement, he would not be able to paint an entire church.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------If we move to another field as sport is always more evident the existence of a pattern. Indeed, it is crystal clear that professional players need to pratice everyday, regardless their talent.However, Ronaldo this year has winned the nominee for the best football player in the world not only for his innate talent but also for the effort put during training in order to reach always an higher goal.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------In conclusion, through commitment you will obtain good results, but to achieve the highest level you must be gifted with a natural talent."; On the one hand, the proponents of talent argue that it's an innate ability which gives certain individuals an advantage in these fields. They argue that these people have a unique combination of physical qualities, creative instincts and artistic perception which gives them a significant advantage over other people. However, there are others who argue that any child can be taught to become a good artist or sports person if they are willing to work at it. According to this view, determination, proper training and encouragement can develop skills and talents in a person with no special initial abilities. Michael Jordan is a good example of a sportsman who was particularly good at his sport from a very early age, showing clearly that he was born with a natural talent for the sport. In my view, a more reasonable approach is somewhere in between these two extremes. For example, there are countless examples of sports academies producing world class athletes through years of intensive training and coaching. This suggests that a willingness to work hard can overcome talent in some cases. School and community sports and arts programmes play an important role in this regard. Some of the best athletes in the world, like Serena Williams, have shown a remarkable willingness to train and put in the necessary hours to become great. And finally, some people succeed despite their lack of talent and only through hard work and a willingness to try. So in conclusion, while both talent and effort are important, there is a clear distinction between the two, and nurturing both talent and hard work seems to be the best approach.
1420;Learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Evaluation of the importance of timing is essential, past to show the importance of their present, while that to even remember their past because it would not help them at all. It is a very controversial and complicated matter., many people believe this statement, for many reasons. Firstly, all of us had made many mistakes which we would not like to remember, they will affect their present because they can create some problems with our families example. Secondly, instead of remembering those past trials, one should get the benefits of their present.Regardless of what I said previously, many people are sticking to their past to give themselves a push in their present. It can give a way of learning from mistakes, and a good chance to try to avoid anything that once lead to a past failure.Moreover, success will not come without failure, everybody should make an attempt, even if it fails, and it may become a big success if they try it again and again. In addition, our past is our culture and heritage which we should not forget at all, it is a matter of value to our present and future, and will remain such till the day will die.To sum up, in my opinion, we can not live without a past, it is our value of life. it can help create your experiences and solve your problems better in the future.; I strongly disagree with this statement. First of all, history provides essential lessons to guide us to the present. The statement that learning about the past is of no value for those of us living in the present is a total misunderstanding of the value of historical knowledge in contemporary society. On the contrary, by learning about the past, we learn how to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. For example, the 1929 stock market crash provides an excellent example of the dangers of irrational financial behavior and the importance of financial regulations. By studying these past events, we can build economic policies that help us to avoid future crises. History also enhances our understanding of cultural differences and social structures. The complexities of today's multicultural societies are rooted in the historical conditions that shaped different social dynamics, and learning about the past struggles and achievements of different communities can help to deepen our appreciation for diverse perspectives. Moreover, historical knowledge serves as the foundation for innovation and creativity. For example, understanding the civil rights movement in the United States can help us to understand the ongoing struggle for equality and justice, and can motivate people to support contemporary issues of equality and justice. For example, Renaissance art and literature, based on a revival of classical learning, created a foundation for contemporary art and literature. Finally, learning about the past is not only valuable but also necessary. Learning about the past inspires individuals to cultivate a more enlightened and empathetic society, fostering a more prosperous and peaceful future. It guides our present actions, builds social cohesion, and encourages creativity for the future.
1197;Learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Learning about the past may provide advantages and disadvantages, depending on the position we are situate ourselves in life ;Undoubtedly, it has great advantages for the ones who need to progress in life, despite what they had been through, because to my opinion, greatest lessons in life come with our own experiences. Advantages of learning about the past are also on the side of the ones who personally know themselves very well and stay honest to themselves at all times.For example, someone who try to be someone, acting to please influent people or trying to get somewhere he or she would not be able to if he were playing real, could be embarrassed by their own mistakes or feeling humiliated when looking back to what he accomplished to get where he/she is now ; therefore the past in this situation would not be a great option for him to look back after.Despite this kind of personality, there are lots of people who find out constructive knowledge in looking back to the past, regardless of how great or bad it could be.The kind of people who actually face their own past and do not try to hide it are the ones who are not scared of how people will judge them, but are willing to make greate changes in their future.It is ,to me, the definition of true progress; how could we learn from our own experiences if we are not willing to face ourselves ?Past can be hurtful but I do think that everything we have been through is a constructive lesson for today and tomorrow."; A few reasons may convince you that historical knowledge is irrelevant for those living in the present day. But I would like to show you why I disagree. Firstly, historical knowledge is full of lessons that can be learned. In this way, we can learn from the mistakes of others. For example, the economic crisis of the Great Depression in the 30s has led to a change in fiscal and banking policies. By learning from the past, we can learn from the mistakes of our predecessors. Secondly, learning about the past can create a sense of belonging and identity. Many of our traditions, customs and values have their roots in the past. In this way, history becomes a guidebook that helps us make good decisions. Thirdly, historical knowledge gives us a richer understanding of human existence, and in this way, for example, it shows us the context of contemporary issues such as conflict, inequality and social change. Fourthly, we can see our place in the context of society and that can give us a sense of pride and unity. For example, the civil rights movement in the United States, for example, has drawn a great deal on historical experiences and has therefore inspired the younger generation to fight for equality and social justice. Fifthly, it is a source of insight into the contemporary world. By studying the experiences of previous civilizations, successes and failures, we can understand the current global dilemmas. Sixthly, we should not see history as a relic but as a vital tool for dealing with today's problems and building a better future. He informs us about the decisions we make, gives us an identity, and increases our understanding of the world.
1375;Many believe that international tourism is bad for their country (reasons and solutions);Many people believe that international tourism is a bad thing for their countries. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to change this negative attitude towards international tourism?Many individuals think that foreign tourism brings negative effects to their countries. There are several reasons for such negative attitude towards international travelers. However, a couple of solutions could be adopted to handle this situation, as will now be discussed.International tourists are often criticized for their contribution to the environmental degradation. It has continuously been noticed that they throw rubbish in their surroundings irresponsibly, which increases the amount of litter everywhere, despite all attempts to reduce waste produced by the local community. This contributes to water, air and soil contamination.Furthermore, foreign tourism has a harmful influence on traditional customs and indigenous practices of host countries because many tourists are careless and insensitive the emotions and feelings of local residents. For instance, in India, some foreign travelers wear inappropriate clothes or expose too much of skin when they visit sacred places, which leads to some negative attitude and the local public.However, this situation can be improved different solutions which could be handled by the government. The government should explain the benefits of international tourism which contributes to the development of local . They not only spend money in shops and restaurants but also create jobs in service industries, and this aspect could be publicized. Additionally, the government should increase the awareness among the foreigners through different media such as roadside billboards and advertisements, and tourists should be encouraged to get rid of rubbish correctly.In conclusion, the inhospitable feeling that the local people have for international tourists can be explained in many ways. However, in my opinion, the government’s involvement is essential to change the negative attitude by citing various advantages of international tourism to their country and raising awareness among tourists in order to protect local habitats.This essay covers the entire task topic by exploring both reasons for negative attitude towards international tourism and some possible actions to change it. The writer explains why locals may resent international tourists and suggests what steps can be taken to transform the way people feel about foreigners in their country. The information is well-organised by the use of paragraphing, and the writer moves from one idea to the next effortlessly, with the help of linking words. A wide range of vocabulary is used, including less common words such as “degradation”,”inhospitable”, “habitat”, “awareness” and “sacred”. Instances of inaccurate word choice are rare, and even these slips don’t cause difficulty for the reader. Overall, this looks like a Band 8 essay.; Is it true? Writing: International tourism is a significant part of the economies of many countries. However, there are also critics who claim that the influx of tourists has a negative impact on local communities, the environment and local cultures. It is important to understand these concerns so that the tourism industry can be balanced between the well-being of the population and the needs of the environment. Such complaints, for example, can arise from the fact that too much waste generated by tourists burdens the local waste management system, which is not designed to handle such large quantities. Another reason why international tourism is considered a negative phenomenon is that it places a strain on local resources. Local traditions and customs can become commercialized and diluted to meet tourist expectations. Prices for housing are rising because of the growing number of tourist-rented houses, so many residents cannot afford to live in these places. So to reduce these negative impacts, countries can adopt sustainable tourism practices, limiting the number of tourists and protecting vulnerable natural areas. It may also result in the disappearance of cultural heritage, in which the uniqueness of a particular place is overshadowed by a homogenized tourist experience. Further, the involvement of local communities in tourism planning gives them the power to maintain their culture and environment. For example, visitor quotas in national parks ensure that natural habitats are preserved, while ensuring that tourists experience a high-quality stay. Also, promoting off-peak travel and the less visited destinations will spread the benefits of tourism over a wider area and reduce pressure on overcrowded places. It is therefore important to recognize the downside of international tourism, to mitigate its negative impacts and to ensure that it does not undermine local societies. Moreover, it is necessary to support community-based tourism initiatives, which can promote the tourism industry as a tool for community empowerment, rather than exploitation.
1297;Many cities have areas where the only cars are taxis and buses.Is this a positive or a negative development? What are the effects of this on individuals and society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Banning cars from the centre of various cities around the world has been a strategy to reduce pollution and encourage people to use public transport. It has had various positive effects for both individuals and for society as a whole.Banning cars from the centre of cities seems to be a very positive development. Fewer cars on the road means less pollution and fewer fossil fuel resources being used up. Although the effect on resources might be relatively negligible, it can create a newer way of thinking regarding the dynamics of transport within cities and this could be the most important benefit to society. Some people working in the centre of these cities may complain about inconvenience, but many would agree that this is a small price to pay.A reduction in the reliance of people on private vehicles is likely to encourage them to use public transport or even bicycles. Using public transport, especially the types that run on clean sources of power, will significantly raise air quality levels in cities, which will of course benefit everyone. The clean air could even further encourage the use of bicycles, which would in turn promote more healthy lifestyles and less obesity. This would contribute on an individual level to people’s well-being and a better and longer life, and on a societal level, it would lessen the strain on public health resources. Governments could encourage this by creating more bicycle lanes to make cycling easier and safer.In conclusion, it is clear that banning cars from the centre of cities is significantly beneficial. Better health and ecology, as well as improvement in longevity and well-being can benefit individuals and the entire society.; I would like to say that this development is mainly positive, since it brings with it several benefits for both individuals and society. Firstly, by reducing the number of private cars in city centers, congestion is reduced. A good example of this is in Amsterdam and Copenhagen, where car-free zones have reduced congestion and waiting times for public transport. There is often a lot of traffic in cities, which can lead to longer journey times and frustration amongst drivers. By putting the emphasis on public transport, the route can be shortened and a more efficient journey experience can be offered. Secondly, there is a significant improvement in the environment because the number of private cars is reduced, which means less pollution and fewer emissions of greenhouse gases, which in turn makes it easier for the city to contribute to climate change mitigation and a healthy life for citizens. In addition, it often contributes to a better quality of life for residents in these zones, because the traffic noise is reduced and there is a safer space for pedestrians. This can be seen in cities like Barcelona, where car access has been restricted in some districts, which has led to a significant reduction in air pollution. In conclusion, restricting private cars in urban areas ultimately means reduced congestion, improved air quality and enhanced community life. Walking, cycling and socializing are encouraged, resulting in greater social cohesion. Times Square in New York has been converted into a pedestrian square and now has a much larger number of public events and meetings. These positive developments can contribute to the development of a sustainable and livable city life, which benefits both the individual and society.
1332;Many countries are experiencing population growth and need to build more homes. Some say that new homes should be constructed in existing cities while others argue that new towns should be built to accommodate the growing population. What are the advantages and disadvantages of these points of view?;In the past two decades, there has been an exponential increase in the migration of people to different cities and countries, indirectly resulting in a considerable infrastructure development. However, there has been a long-standing debate on whether to direct these infrastructure projects to current cities or establish new counties. Careful consideration of both alternatives reveals that each has its positives and negatives.One of the major advantages of focusing on current cities for new construction is that it would benefit the residents of the cities in multiple ways. Tenants living in Vancouver would prefer to buy a newly constructed house in the city where they work rather than in a new town, to reduce their commute time. Moreover, the city has everything they desire such as efficient public transport, thriving job market and affordable healthcare. This would not be possible in new towns because of the time it takes to establish services and generate opportunities for people.On the other hand, accommodating people in houses built in newly created towns would put them in a pollution-free and clean environment. This is because new towns may take at least 10 years of time to become an attractive spot for people and industries alike. As a result, their exposure to harmful emissions from industrial plants and transportation is reduced, shielding them from the risks of acquiring health complications. A recent report released by the word Health Organization (WHO) suggests that the number of people affected by airborne infections is 20% higher in cities compared to new towns that were formed just a couple of years ago.In conclusion, while there are both positive and negative aspects to these views, the decision on where to build the new homes to accommodate increasing population will depend on many other factors as well. Therefore, a thorough assessment is required before starting an infrastructure project.; When new homes are built in existing cities, they can take advantage of the existing transport, electricity, water, and other services, and this can save money and reduce the impact on the environment. In the case of new towns, there are advantages and disadvantages to each solution. The rapid growth of the population in many countries has led to the question of where to build new homes, whether in existing cities or in new towns. Cities have many benefits, such as improving the local economy by increasing the demand for local businesses and services. However, they also have many disadvantages. If new homes are not properly integrated, they can lead to overcrowding, higher living costs, and the disruption of established communities. On the other hand, building new towns allows for the development of a completely new community, with modern amenities and plenty of green space. The establishment of new towns is resource- and time-consuming. They can be built in accordance with sustainable development principles and have efficient transport systems. In addition, they relieve pressure on existing cities and allow people to be more evenly distributed throughout the country. In conclusion, both approaches to population growth have advantages and disadvantages. The first stage of a new town is to build basic services, and residents are reluctant to move into the town until these services are established. The best solution is to take both approaches into account, perhaps by adopting a hybrid approach which combines both new towns and city expansion.
1327;Many people argue that museums and art galleries should present the nation’s art, as opposed to artworks from other countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The cultural value of engaging with museums and art galleries is unquestionable; they exert a great deal of influence on our perception of the world. It is only reasonable to ponder whether or not these outlets of culture should concentrate their efforts on presenting the nation’s own art, and not that of other countries. In my opinion, there should be an attempt to strike a balance and put the objects of national art in the spotlight, while allowing the public to get acquainted with foreign artworks to a certain extent.If people were to only find sculptures and paintings by national artists in their local museums, that would have a number of positive effects, such as the fame the artists of that country would gain and the pride its citizens would feel for their fellow countrymen. It would promote patriotism and strengthen the image of the country in the eyes of its inhabitants. Local artists would also receive more financial assistance from the government as their works would generate a significant amount of interest, potentially resulting in further development of the local art. However, in order to evolve art needs fresh ideas, and without exposure to a wider range of creativity the world provides, the evolution of local arts may be hindered.People enjoy art because it appeals to their inner sense of beauty and triggers strong emotions, and whether the masterpiece that causes these feelings belongs to a local or foreign artist is irrelevant. Talent knows no geographical boundaries; therefore, the emphasis should be on how much joy or amazement the work of art brings, rather than on its origin. If that principle were to be followed, we would never have to choose between local and international art. Reducing our museums or galleries’ collections to local art works, in my view, would be harmful and go against the democratic nature of art.To sum up, it seems to me that a country has nothing to lose by allowing its people to admire art created elsewhere in the world. A conscious choice by the government to support local artists while hosting exhibitions from other countries could prove the most beneficial."; Some people argue that it is a question of national identity, a question of nationalism and a question of ancestry, and that showing local talent and local history gives people a sense of belonging. The debate whether to show national art or not is a complex one. The argument goes that national art is the most important way of expressing the people’s values and struggles, and as such, it is an essential way of representing national culture. However, I would argue that national art is only one part of a broader cultural understanding. Art is universal, and is found all over the world, transcending national borders. Besides, artists often draw inspiration from different sources, and international exchange is vital to artistic development. In this way, exposure to different cultures and influences is both educational and a stimulus to creativity. Finally, while it is essential that museums and galleries pay homage to and present their national artistic heritage, they should not disregard the wealth of international art. A balanced display of both national and international art in the same museum or gallery both acclaims local culture and places it in a wider context. The result is a richer and more inclusive experience of art for everyone.
955;Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?;Numerous experts think that every country should be capable to produce more materials and commodities. I agree with this argument as it brings benefits to countries and I will highlight some of them.To begin with, manufacturing goods is essential to any country as it helps to build their economy. Increasing production power assist them to export more and it also makes them less dependent on other countries. For instance, China is one of the largest producers in the world in any goods which also makes them the largest exporter. Such development in production power contributes to their gross domestic product.Another reason is that extra produced goods can be used in emergencies, such emergencies are pandemics, financial crises and many more. By growing the production of goods and materials, a country will always be a reliable business partner. Thus, companies will reach out to them and become loyal partners. Moreover, countries should be aware that by increasing their production. For example, there is a semiconductor chip crisis is going on all over the world and no country in the world is able to meet the demands of chips. On the contrary, India is now planning to satisfy the demand for chips by strengthening its manufacturing capacity to a massive level while it will directly contribute to their economy and also generate job opportunities.To conclude, I agree that more in-house production is necessary. It is extremely crucial to produce more needed products in order to consistently outperform the rest of the world and also it brings many beneficial things like generating job opportunities and a rise in the Gross domestic product of a country.; Probably this point of view is associated with a desire for economic growth and the improvement of the life of people. However, I think that the obsession with increasing production is not appropriate and does not lead to sustainable development. In the first place, the most important thing is that the uncontrolled pursuit of production will inevitably lead to severe damage to the environment. In particular, industries that produce more products will lead to the accumulation of greenhouse gases and thereby cause global warming, which will have long-term consequences for the world's environment and the lives of people. Secondly, the pursuit of high productivity is usually achieved at the expense of the environment and leads to deforestation, poisoning and exhaustion of natural resources. In addition, production growth does not always lead to a more comfortable life for all people. Economic growth does not mean a fairer distribution of goods. And thirdly, the emergence of a pandemic in the world has emphasized the need for economies to have greater resilience. For example, countries that have mainly relied on high productivity have experienced significant difficulties in overcoming the interruption of supplies. The main goal should therefore be to achieve sustainable development, which is socially just, environmentally friendly and economically stable. To conclude, while increasing productivity can contribute to economic prosperity, it should not be the only goal of states. A more balanced approach to the economy, which emphasizes social justice and the environment, is not only more appropriate but also necessary for sustainable development in the long run. This has led to a shift in priorities towards more local production, resource management and quality over quantity.
1367;Many people believe that reducing speed limits is the best option for road safety improvement (agree/disagree);"Many people believe that reducing speed limits is the best option for road safety improvement. Do you think there are other measures that could be put in place? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?One of the most conspicuous trends of today’s world is a colossal surge in the number of vehicle accidents cars, trucks and buses, all over the , be it in impoverished or developed nations. There is a wide range of factors that . In my opinion, this situation could be remedied, provided some effective measures are taken.Measures to deal with this soaring concern are many; the most significant are not remote or complicated but accessible and practicable. The primary one lies in the fact that governments should take a firm stance and apply stringent rules and regulations to lower the speed limit. Secondly, using electronic devices while driving should be forbidden by law. Finally, an awareness program could be initiated by individuals to educate the public about the catastrophic effects of unsafe roads and the projected enhancements for road safety. Only when convergent efforts from all sectors are ensured, can we expect to see considerable progress in tackling this problem.There is a deluge of merits for implementation of reduced speed limits. High speed is likely to impose life threatening danger on people crossing the roads, due to the perilous nature of this hazardous speed with danger being an integral part of it. Not only does reducing the speed limits contribute to decreasing daily accidents, but it also raises the standard of driving. Needless to say, all these advantages have a far-reaching impact on pedestrian safety.There are, however, some pitfalls that can easily overpower the potential benefits of limiting speed. The primary one stems from the fact that slowing the speed could lead to augmenting the daily traffic hours. Besides, it could also delay delivering sick and patients to hospitals. Hence, it is apparent why some individuals are against changing the standardized level of speed.From what has been discussed, one can conclude that despite the drawbacks of reducing speed limits, the expected benefits of this measure are indeed far greater.All the parts of the task have been covered fairly well. The response presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt with suitable, widely covered and thoroughly supported ideas. The range of vocabulary is adequate for the requirements of task response. There are some mistakes in word choice and grammar. Nevertheless, the essay is up to the mark and is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS."; I strongly agree that reducing speed limits is the most effective measure for improving road safety. The issue of improving road safety is a matter of great concern for governments around the world. It has been scientifically proven that the probability of death in a car accident increases significantly with speed. For example, pedestrians struck by a car going at thirty miles per hour have more chances to survive than pedestrians struck at forty miles per hour. The issue of reducing speed limits is especially important in urban areas where there are a lot of pedestrians. Not only are drivers encouraged to be more careful when driving, but the severity of accidents is reduced as well. Moreover, reducing speed limits makes it possible to carry out other measures for improving road safety such as improving road markings, improving signs and improving the efficiency of police officers. Reducing speed limits also gives drivers more time to respond to unexpected actions of other road users such as cyclists, pedestrians and other drivers. This not only reduces the probability of accidents but also encourages drivers to be more careful. These measures together can save lives and ensure the well-being of road users. In conclusion, reducing speed limits is indeed one of the most effective ways of improving road safety. Hence, this measure should be the first priority of any comprehensive road safety strategy.
1290;Many people believe that studying at university is the best way to develop oneself, learn new skills and find a well-paid job. Other people believe that more is learned from getting a job straight away after school and learning whilst working.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;There are many ways to learn new knowledge and skills. Traditional educational routes, such as school followed by college or university is one route that is generally accepted and respected by today’s society. It can be argued, however, that this is not always the best way. A more vocational route can be more appropriate for certain people and for particular jobs.Universities generally have deference given to them and, due to this, most schools tailor their programs to help students get university admission. Universities usually have respected and highly qualified teachers who have the knowledge and the skills to take their students to very high levels of knowledge and expertise. The very difficulty of gaining admission, getting through the duration of the course and passing final exams ensures to employers that graduates have the necessary self-discipline, intelligence and ability to get through the courses.Universities are also particularly well suited to the teaching of various subjects, for example, medicine, law and literature and these subjects need students’ full-time attention in order to do well. Although vocational experience is necessary, a certain grounding in basic concepts to a high-level is important. Once this knowledge has been acquired, students can then integrate their knowledge with practical understanding.This, however, is not the case for all areas of learning, especially ones where the quantity of high level knowledge is not required or is possible to be learned whilst working at the same time. Young people studying to be an electrician or a plumber are good examples. To do this work well requires a lot of experience, yet also a sound understanding of theory. The learning here can be and is done working and studying at the same time, often through apprenticeships and vocational courses involving significant amounts of work experience.Therefore, in my opinion, there are more ways than one to acquire a profession. Whether learning should take place at university alone or whilst working depends on the course and the end job.; Proponents of higher education claim that university provides its students with important theoretical knowledge and critical thinking skills. Both ways offer advantages and disadvantages which affect the course of a career and life in general. Universities also offer internships, connections, and opportunities that lead to well-paid employment and long-term career success. In the job market, the university graduate usually has a head start, as many employers value graduates, because they believe that they have discipline and a deep understanding of the subject. In the case of professions such as medicine, engineering, and education, a degree is crucial. But many people think that entering the workforce sooner brings more practical knowledge and skills that cannot be learned in the classroom. It also develops soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability. This may be the best way to learn depending on personal circumstances and career goals. People who start working straight away may have more financial independence and fewer student debts and are therefore more attractive to employers who prefer practical skills to formal education. In some industries such as IT and the trades, employers may prefer skills and experience over academic qualifications. In the end, the choice is a personal one, based on individual goals, financial situation, and circumstances. Ultimately, it is the most appropriate way to study, depending on personal ambitions, circumstances, and opportunities.
1288;Many people in cities today live in high-rise apartment blocks. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this type of living?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;High-rise apartment blocks are a common sight in cities around the world. They are especially popular in large cities and in locations where building land is scarce. Living in such buildings has various advantages and disadvantages for town planners and the inhabitants themselves.The most significant advantage of high-rise apartment blocks is probably for the town planners. With land often being at a premium in large cities, one way to maximise space is to build upwards, so that the population density per square kilometre can be increased. The demand for housing in big cities can therefore be more easily met. There are also disadvantages for town planners. The heavier population density can put added pressure on social facilities, for example sewage and other waste disposal, and the provision of adequate school and medical services.There are also advantages and disadvantages for the actual inhabitants of high-rise apartment blocks. With the demand for housing being reduced, prices are therefore not as high, making housing more affordable. Many people also like not having to be responsible for a garden, and living in an apartment has this advantage. Finally, with so many people living in the same area, many friendships can be made and a community spirit can be built up. It appears the most significant disadvantage is that, in practice, living in high-rise apartment blocks is just not the lifestyle many people want. In some city neighbourhoods, these living spaces can often be associated with poor living conditions and undesirable social elements. In addition, many people view high-rise apartment blocks as being unsafe. For example, in the case of fire, tall buildings are difficult or impossible to evacuate safely.It is clear that high-rise apartment blocks have benefits and drawbacks. It is also clear, however, that due to the need to house increasing numbers of people in cities, these architectural features are here to stay, whether people like them or not.;" For example: There is one main advantage to living in a high-rise apartment, and that is the advantage of living in a small space. The disadvantages of this type of living are a few: The main disadvantage is that it is very expensive to rent and live in a high-rise apartment, and the second disadvantage is that it is a rather difficult environment for many people to live in. However, there are many advantages: high-rise buildings can accommodate many people in a small area, which is particularly beneficial in cities with scarce land; residents of high-rise buildings can easily communicate with each other through shared rooms, gardens, and other entertainment. Also, large windows make rooms bright and clean, and a good feeling of life and happiness. The second advantage is that there are magnificent views and sunlight. The disadvantages of high-rise buildings are that they are noisy, overcrowded, and dependent on elevators. Elevators can break down during emergencies or at busy times, and residents will be inconvenienced. The third disadvantage is that residents may not feel safe in high-rise buildings because of a lack of security, even though the building has a control system. In conclusion, high-rise apartment life is both advantageous and disadvantageous. It depends on the preferences and priorities of individual residents."
789;Many people now undertake extreme activities, from hang-gliding to mountain climbing.Why do people risk their lives in this way, and do you think this is a good trend?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Extreme sports, such as mountain climbing and hand-gliding, have become increasingly popular over the past several decades. Now more than ever, athletes can be paid to do these activities full-time, encouraging more aspiring athletes to enter extreme sports. In addition, the addictive nature of these activities means that participants tend to stay in the sport for the thrill. While the increased popularity can result in more accidents, it can also make the sports safer as atheletes collectively learn from past mistakes.While people have undertaken extreme activities long before the advent of television and social media, these new platforms give extreme sports the much needed sponsorship and attention. Nowadays, outlandish and dangerous acts can be televised and monetized, giving the athletes a way to make a living out of these events. Therefore, more people would feel encouraged to participate in these activities knowing that they can have a decent income. On top of the external motivation, most extreme athletes take part in these sports because they are thrilling and addicting. These atheletes chase the rush and validation that they get when doing dangerous activities. As a result, even without the external rewards, some people would still partake in these sports.Given that people are motivated both internally and externally to participate in extreme sports, it is inevitable that these activities become more popular. While it is true that increased participation would result in more accidents, it would also create more lessons for future participants. In this way, these accidents and injuries would help educate future athletes on how to protect themselves. Moreoever, this increased popularity would also encourage governments to draft more safety regulations.In conclusion, given that it is human nature to want to achieve feats of strength and courage, extreme sports would always be attractive for some. Because of this, there will always be people injuring themselves while pursuing these feats. Therefore, these activities would become safer the more athletes learn from past incidents.; This sort of activity may give the thrill of a lifetime but raises many questions about the reasons why people do it and its effects on society. In recent years, people have become more and more interested in extreme sports, such as hang-gliding, base-jumping, and mountain climbing. People often do this for several reasons, including the desire for adventure, the search for personal satisfaction, and the desire for social recognition. It is not just that people are pushed to their physical limits, but that they feel they have a close connection with nature. However, the main reason is the excitement and the resulting rush of the blood. Many people undertake extreme activities in order to escape from their everyday lives. The activities offer a temporary escape from everyday problems. This connection with nature may also help them to feel closer to God. However, the growing popularity of extreme sports can also have a negative effect on society. A sense of community is one of the reasons why people do extreme sports, and social media are playing an increasingly important role in helping people to meet each other and to share experiences. In conclusion, the current interest in extreme activities reflects the human need for adventure and self-discovery. But extreme sports also raise concerns about the safety of participants, and there may be many accidents that could result in serious injuries or even death. If people want this trend to continue, they must put safety first and respect the challenges. Although there are risks involved, it is possible that the positive outcomes of personal development and greater awareness of the environment outweigh the risks.
1345;Many people support animal testing while others believe it isn’t appropriate (discuss);Many people support use of animals for testing medicines for humans. Others believe it isn’t appropriate to use animals for such experiments. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayApproval of the medicines for human use is a tedious process which involves a series of tests often performed on animals. While some people support this idea because it makes drugs safer for human consumption, others believe that it is an unethical practice. Personally, I am in favour of the idea that medicines should be tested in all possible scenarios before being released to the public.Those against animal experimentation argue that animals have the same rights as human beings because they are the outcome of the same evolution process through which humans came into existence. Infecting them with viruses and exposing them to bacteria, to create a conducive environment to test a chemical substance may cause excruciating pain to these lab animals. Any failed test can mean that the subject either loses its precious life or suffers for the rest of its existence, and understandably, some people are against what they consider an immoral practice.Nonetheless, if a drug is released into the market without a thorough end-to-end testing, it could cause severe damage to anyone who may consume it. Every day a large number of animals are being mercilessly killed by humans for their mere flesh and skin. There isn’t a big difference between killing an animal for food and sacrificing its life for testing a chemical composition, because both actions are helping the human race to survive. What’s more, the life of one animal used to test a life-saving drug could help many people live. This is why a large number of people believe that testing drugs on animals is a matter of survival.To sum up, there are valid reasons why animal testing seems cruel and unacceptable to some, and crucial to others. In my opinion, even though animals subjected to testing may suffer, it is a necessary step to ensure the healing power of a drug.; Those who advocate animal testing claim that it is vital for advancing medical research and ensuring the safety of various products, and that animals, with their similarity to humans, offer an invaluable model for understanding the causes of illnesses and for evaluating the effectiveness of new treatments. The issue of animal testing has long been controversial and has provoked heated debates among scientists, ethicists and the general public. Proponents of animal testing argue that without it the development of new medicines would be severely hindered, which would inevitably lead to more human suffering. The development of life-saving medicines such as the polio vaccine and insulin for diabetes often depend on data gathered in animal experiments. Opponents of animal testing point out the limitations of animal experiments, arguing that research findings in animals do not always apply directly to humans because of differences in the animal’s biology. This can lead to misleading conclusions and the approval of harmful products, or the rejection of promising treatments on the basis of inaccurate data gathered from animal experiments. They argue that experiments on animals are an abuse of their rights and often cause them unnecessary suffering and death. In conclusion, the debate over animal testing revolves around both the potential advances in medical science and the ethical issues it raises. The development of alternative methods, such as in-vitro testing and computer modeling, has grown in recent years and these methods are often more accurate and do not raise the ethical issues that animal experiments do. Science is advancing at an ever increasing rate, and the development of new medical treatments and of more accurate methods of testing remain a challenge. While proponents of animal testing highlight its importance for medical research, the opponents argue for more respect for the rights of animals and the need to develop more effective alternatives.
327;Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. Do you agree or disagree?;It is undeniable that nowadays, smart devices such as phones and tablets play an essential role in one's life. Through countless websites and applications, people can connect with each other without any boundaries. While many people agree that the introduction of these technologies has many disadvantages to the conservative way of starting and maintaining relationships, I personally believe that they rather develop new socializing methods.First and foremost, social medias and applications can help with keeping in touch with acquintances. Previously, people had to follow a precise time and location to meet up with their friends as they are unable to contact the others to reschedule. However, the internet allows them to update their plans at any time. This means that if there is any emergency, an individual can immediately postpone the upcoming event and find the next available slot to continue the plan. Furthermore, there are several applications that allow people to video call their friends and family who are currently living apart.The current technologies not only offer us options to communicate with our current contacts but also allow us to discover new friends. In the past, it is difficult to find people with a common interest which had to be done through social events. Nowadays, online communities enable their users to connect with new friends virtually. Thus, fewer individuals are left alone, especially introverts and those who are living in remote areas which can have difficulties socializing offline.All in all, despite the fact that there are many positive impacts of the invention of social medias and communication technologies, there are also risks and downsides of using them without face-to-face communication. Therefore, the time used for socializing online and offline should always be balanced.; I agree and I will give my reasons. It seems to me that the rise of social media has created a superficial culture in the way we socialize with others. Because of the presence of platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, people often seek more contacts instead of quality relationships, and instead of long and meaningful conversations, they often respond with “likes,” “smileys,” and brief comments. Moreover, a “friend” on social media does not necessarily mean that you have a real friend, so you may still feel lonely and lonely even if you have many friends on social media. In addition, if you have a tendency to use technology too much, it may interfere with your ability to communicate with others face-to-face. It is because the body language and tone of voice are lost when we communicate through digital media, which often leads to misunderstandings and even conflicts. Many people, especially young people, are beginning to feel uncomfortable with direct conversations. And, in this way, it becomes more difficult to be close to each other in person. Finally, with so much new information and notification features available, it has become difficult for us to focus on the present and the people around us. It is becoming easier to create an unbalanced relationship between technology and real human relationships. In conclusion, although modern communication technology brings many benefits, I think it is important to pay attention to the negative impact of technology on human relationships.
837;Many people today, especially in the developed world, are choosing to have fewer children, or none at all.Why is this happening, and do you think it is a good trend?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Weather to have children or not is one of the most important questions young adults have to ask themselfs nowadays. Overpopulation is one of the many global problems next to climate change, and poverty.In my opinion, the need to have children roots back to us being nothing more, but civilised animals. Animals have one goal above all; reproduce. This is why in many cultures, men and women who cannot have chlidren are seen as disabled, or sick. Nowadays, modern values changed our perspective, having children is often seen as a necessity for a happy, and successful life.It is important to recognise the problems the developed world faces. There is smoke in the air, plastic pollution everywhere, poverty in third world countries, and many other factors that make Earth a terrible place for many. Above all, the life we give birth to will have to eat, drink, and consume just like everyone else, using more and more of the already limited resources, generating more and more trash.Many people argue that the above mentioned points are a pessimistic and unrealistic. Humans have to reproduce, to keep the species from extintion. And truthfully the only way to do that, is to give birth as many kids as possible. This issue lies deep in our society; here in Hungary, a family is rewared almost 30000 USD if they have 3 or more kids. This means that many people have children because they get money for it, and they are also seen socially accepted.I believe modern day intelligence goes further than IQ points and money earned. We have to recognise the problems created, overpopulation being one of them. While I do not believe that we should not have kids, I think there should be careful planning involved and self-reflection before giving birth to new life."; It has been a significant trend in recent years, especially in developed countries, for many individuals and couples to have fewer children, or none at all. There are many reasons for this choice, and the positive or negative impact on society is a matter of debate. Also, there is a greater emphasis on the development of career and personal freedom. In the developed world, the cost of bringing up children has risen considerably in recent decades, and the expenses of education, child care, health and general upbringing have become too burdensome for many families, especially in the current difficult economic climate. Also, in many families, a greater emphasis is placed on career and development, and there is a greater desire for career success, travel and life satisfaction, and this reflects wider changes in society and the ways in which success and happiness are perceived by individuals outside the traditional family structure. Besides, having fewer children means having more resources and attention to each child, and this may mean higher educational achievement and higher quality of life. From the broader point of view of society, fewer children may have a positive effect on the environment, as less population growth may ease the burden on natural resources, such as food, water and energy, which are becoming increasingly limited. In addition, the trend towards fewer children and no children is based on sound economic and social reasons, but the consequences are complex. From the point of view of demography, there is a concern that the population will become aging and less viable in the context of social and health care costs. But the choice of a few people and no children may also give a new energy and inspiration to the younger generations. Therefore, it is essential for a country to be able to cope with the broader problems of society as well as the personal choices of its citizens.
1317;Many people try to achieve a work-life balance but fail. Why is this happening? What can be done to help people overcome this problem?;Many people strive to achieve a work-life balance, but often find themselves failing despite their best efforts. This is not surprising, as balancing work and life commitments can be extremely difficult due to both having their unique stressors.One of the major reasons why so many people struggle to achieve harmony between their personal and professional lives is that now it is easier than ever for people to stay connected outside of regular work hours. This has led to an expectation that employees should always be available, and they risk being seen as unreliable or uncommitted if they are not. A knock-on effect of longer working hours is that little time is left for leisure activities such as socialising or engaging in hobbies or sports, which help reduce stress levels and improve overall well-being. This type of pressure and lack of free time can lead to feelings of burnout, with no respite from life’s pressures, resulting in chronic fatigue and diminished motivation over time.Helping those struggling to find a suitable work-life balance will require joint efforts of managers and employees. Workers, for instance, need to recognise the importance of taking regular breaks throughout the day and getting enough sleep each night, while employers should consider being more flexible when it comes to allowing staff to work remotely and offering paid vacation days. This will give employees space, both mentally and physically, enabling them to better manage their commitments without overextending themselves.In conclusion, achieving a successful work-life balance is something that many cannot quite reach due to external pressures from employers and a lack of downtime. However, these issues can be overcome, if we create realistic boundaries between our professional lives and personal goals, and make conscious decisions about how we want to spend our time.; The number of reasons why people can't achieve work-life balance is many. In order to help people achieve this balance, we must understand the underlying causes. It is because the pressure to succeed is high and there is a certain pressure to sacrifice personal interests to succeed in the office. It is also because of the development of smart phones and the convenience of remote work that employees can be connected to work at any time and at any place, so they can work overtime and have no time for family life or personal interests. It is also because of social expectations that many people feel a certain pressure to succeed in all areas of life, such as career, family, health, and friendship, so that they can be exhausted and have no time to care about their own lives. It is also because employers lack the desire to establish a culture that values work-life balance, so they can't give employees flexible working hours or mental health leaves, so they can't support their employees to achieve this balance. It is also because the public's awareness of work is not high enough, so there is a lack of awareness of the importance of personal time and health. So I think education and training should be given to employees to learn to manage their own time and take care of their health, so that they can set their own work priorities. It not only benefits employees, but also improves the productivity and work satisfaction of companies. But more importantly, the environment should be created so that people can achieve a good work-life balance, but the ability to achieve this balance must be supported by the organization. In conclusion, the problem of work-life balance is a complex problem with many aspects, such as high pressure on people, the development of technology, the influence of society and the lack of support for the individual.
1298;Many schoolchildren today take part in work experience sessions for short periods of time instead of attending school. Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It has been a popular trend for some time now to put children into what can be called ‘work experience placements’. The children are taken out of school and take part in various types of work, usually for around a week. Some people criticise this trend, but I can’t see how it can be a negative experience.One of the criticisms is that children lose a week of schoolwork. With the pressure to do well at school increasing, children need every bit of help to maximise their potential. Taking them out of the school, it is therefore argued, stops them from getting access to needed education for a whole week. As the students won’t really be of much help to a workplace for just one week, it would therefore be better for them to remain at school.While this is a valid point, taking a child’s entire experience of school into account, a single week away does not make a significant difference. Indeed, if the timing of the week’s work placements is done correctly, the week can also serve as a kind of ‘holiday’ away from school, something that is regularly needed in order to allow students to remain fresh and enthusiastic. In many work placements, children also get to see some of things they learn at school put into a realistic context, allowing them to understand the relevance of what they learn and thereby creating a way to reinforce the learning.In addition to this, schoolchildren can be quite nervous about the world of work that they will have to join at some point in their lives. By getting this short taste of what it is like, they can see that it is nothing to be scared about. As well as this, children will often have some ideas of what they want to do for a living, but are not sure. By allowing them to see a type of work they are considering, they are better able to decide whether that career could be suitable for them.I feel, therefore, that work placements can be seen as a positive development. Missing a short amount of school is not serious and the benefits that can be gained from the placements are significant.; Work experience is the first opportunity for students to see what life is like in the world of work. This idea that schoolchildren can take part in work experience as part of the school curriculum has aroused a lot of discussion. While some people think it is a negative development, I think it is a positive one and has a lot of advantages for the students. Students who are interested in medicine, for example, are given an opportunity to work at a hospital. Not only can they put their theoretical knowledge into practice, but they can also choose a career for themselves. Students learn how to work together, communicate and solve problems in a professional environment. Secondly, work experience can develop many of the necessary soft skills, which are highly sought after in the labor market. A student who has been given a chance to develop his soft skills is better equipped to handle his future work. Although it is a concern that students who leave school will perform poorly academically, it can be avoided through the careful planning of the school curriculum and the integration of work experience into the school curriculum. It is a positive development that students are given a chance to learn practical skills, develop a positive attitude to work and build up self-confidence in their professional lives. The combination of practical work and academic responsibilities will enrich the overall learning experience without compromising academic success. It is an important part of education to encourage students to think about and prepare for their future work.
1413;Millions of people every year move to English- speaking countries such as Australia, Britain or America, in order to study at school, college or university. Why do so many people want to study in English? Why is English such an important international language?;Nowadays, language becomes a major factor to . Many people prefer to study abroad English-speaking country because English is an international language. There is no doubt that the best way to improve the English language skill is to use the English language daily so if people study in English speaking countries, their will be improved automatically and it will give them some advantages such as work in many countries or they will be to many different places without studying other languages. This essay will describe in detail why English is an important international language.Firstly, the English language is widely used in many countries and at present, the world traders are currently developing rapidly. In order to compete with people from different countries, it is to be able to communicate the English language. For example, China has been improving a lot in many sectors. They are able to compete with other countries because many people in China English language and they are trying hard to study English.Secondly, many companies prefer to employ people who can speak English because if the companies create new in different countries, the employers are able to move the new branch without new people and the branch company is still able to communicate with the central company. In fact, one of the largest companies in the world (Google) has created some in different countries and each of the Google is able to discuss things or otherwise communicate even though they are in different countries because they all use English to communicate.In conclusion, many people move to English speaking countries for further studies because they believe that it will improve their English skills and in order to become a successful person in the future, mastering English is .; You must give your reasons. The first reason is that English is often seen as the international lingua franca, the language that helps people from different cultures and countries to communicate with each other. The English language is also a good medium for communication. English opens up new possibilities for communication and makes it possible to participate in the increasingly international world in which collaboration is becoming the rule. It is this international status that is a very important reason why many people choose to study in English-speaking countries. There are also good reasons why people want to study in English-speaking countries. Firstly, many of them have excellent universities, and this means that they are among the best in the world. Secondly, the countries of the English-speaking world have excellent educational systems, and this attracts people from other countries to their schools. Thirdly, there are many jobs that require knowledge of English, such as working for a large company or in a government department. Fourthly, English-speaking countries offer many courses of study that are not available in other countries. Fifthly, the cultural attractions of English-speaking countries cannot be ignored. They have long histories, a vibrant culture and many opportunities for personal development. As a result, those who study in English-speaking countries often have an advantage in the job market. As the world continues to become more and more interconnected, the importance of English will increase even further and will attract millions of people from all over the world. In conclusion, it can be said that the decision to study in English-speaking countries results from the status of the English language as an international language, from the excellent opportunities for study, from the advantages in the job market and from the rich cultural experience. The advantages are not only in academic terms, but also in the many valuable life experiences that students have while they are studying abroad.
795;Missions to explore space are hugely expensive, and there are problems on Earth which demand attention. The number of these missions needs to be reduced.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is supposed by many, that high-cost space studies should be cut off while more focus should be paid to the challenges mankind face on Earth. This essay completely disargees with such view because of two reasons that will de developed further.The first reason is that only rich countries spend thier budgets for space studies. This means that only when states have resolved most of their problems with poverty, level of medicine treatment, safety, they can divert some of the funds to invest in future technologies. Moreover, citizens will go on a strike and make the govenment to deal with real life problems instead of dreaming about the space. For example, not more than 5% of USA GDP is spent on space programs that is sufficient to progress, construct new sputniks, and send astronauts to the Internations Space Station.The second argument supposes that many space technologies have a dual puropose. In other words, being initially developed for studing the space, they were adopted to make people's day-to-day life easier. For example, mobile phones and the mobile Internet, navigaion using GPS would not be possibe if people were not trying to explore space.In conclusion, new technologies are developed when people are trying to learn the world outside our planet. This; As I see it, it is not the reduction of space missions which would be most appropriate. I acknowledge that they are expensive, but if they offer technological benefits and other important information for life on earth, then reducing their number is not the best solution. These missions have already contributed to the development of a number of technological advances, such as satellite communication and the Global Positioning System (GPS), which are now part of modern life. It is a fact that research for space exploration often leads to the development of useful technology for life on earth. For example, research for the design of space vehicles has led to advances in such fields as radiology, medicine and meteorology. Finally, knowledge of the universe is essential for dealing with the major issues that affect the human species. For example, it is essential to understand the earth’s climate and the effect it has on the earth’s biosphere, and this can be achieved through data collected from satellites in space. Reducing space exploration would reduce progress in fields which are closely related to solving our problems. In any case, tackling the problems on earth does not preclude investments in space exploration. In the wider context, space exploration inspires young people to enter the sciences and to engage in solving cosmic and terrestrial problems. In conclusion, although the financial costs of space exploration cannot be ignored, there are long-term benefits which should be taken into account. For example, international space missions, where a number of countries contribute, reduce the costs and tackle issues related to both space and earth. Governments and institutions can use their resources in such a way as to ensure that these two areas coexist and support each other. In my opinion, a balanced approach which prioritises the needs of space exploration alongside the requirements of life on earth is the best solution.
1434;Modern medicine helps to live a longer life. Do you agree?;"The modern medicine is very important for living a long life. It on new technology. . Also modern medicine is human body. . Therefore I agree that the modern medicine to live longer.First of all, the modern medicine can prevent incurable diseases. Doctors can find some diseases very early. Then doctors can give suitable medicines to patients. New modern doctors . Also intelligent people in the world live a long life modern medicine. That is very important in the human society because their creative things are coming with them and they can help others for a longer time when they are living ., old population is increasing in the country. It is country’s economy and third world countries. But old people are very important in human society because their experience definitely helps to . ‘Experience is better than qualifications’ However, old people are living a long life; it is helping others to live a long life because we can get advice from them and they are covering our culture and society.Moreover, modern medicine is being addictive for some people, so that they cannot live without medicine. They should take medicine all their lives. Also modern medicine is very expensive. Therefore most of poor countries modern medicine and it has taken a commercial shape, also it is depending on money. In the modern medicine human kindness. People who have money can take modern medicine. But indigenous medicine has well human friendly shape. It does not depend on money.To summarize; in my personal view, modern medicine is helping to live a long life . Modern technologies are being supported to find diseases very early. So doctors can take immediately. Therefore, hesitate to agree with the above mentioned statement.Your essay has several confusing sentences, where your meaning is unclear.You mix advantages and disadvantages of the modern medicine in one paragraph when you should divide them – have advantages in one paragraph and disadvantages in another.If you agree with the statement, you should have 2 paragraphs supporting your opinion and one supporting the opposite opinion, in your essay it is 2 against and 1 for."; Medicine has been developing for over a century and has played an important role in preventing many diseases and saving many lives. One of the most important developments of medicine is the development of vaccines. It cannot be overestimated the role of medicine in prolonging the life of a person. This is partly due to the discovery of new vaccines. Moreover, the discovery of antimicrobial and antiviral drugs has changed the treatment of many diseases. Moreover, vaccinations have not only reduced the death rate of people, but have also contributed to the improvement of public health by preventing the spread of contagious diseases. Also, the study of chronic diseases in the field of cardiology and oncology has significantly changed medicine. In addition, many diseases that were once fatal, such as pneumonia and tuberculosis, can now be treated with medicine, so that people recover and live longer and healthier lives. Moreover, the diagnosis of diseases such as diabetes has been made, which is why it is possible to prevent it. However, despite the fact that medicine has made such great progress in the field of extending the life of people, it is important to note that life does not mean life without difficulties. Moreover, such developments as minimally traumatic surgery, targeted therapy and the use of advanced medicines for chemotherapy have contributed to the survival of many patients. Finally, I agree that the development of science has made it possible for people to live longer and healthier lives. However, the role of lifestyle, such as diet and physical activity, also plays an important role in health.
1315;More and more people today are drinking sugar-based drinks. Why is this happening? What measures can be taken to reverse this trend?;An alarming number of people today consume sugar-based drinks, whether it is in the form of soda, energy drinks or fruit drinks. Often consumers are lured by their widespread availability and convenience, however, marketing campaigns also play a role, targeting young people and giving them the perception that sugary drinks are not as unhealthy as they actually are.The availability of these types of drinks has greatly increased over time. They can now be found in almost any store or restaurant, which makes them easily accessible to almost anyone. The fact that they are often cheaper than alternatives, such as water or freshly squeezed juice, makes them an especially attractive option for those on a budget. Marketing campaigns for sugary beverages have been quite successful in creating positive associations attached to these products through advertisements on TV and billboards. This encourages people to consider them fun rather than unhealthy and normalises them within society.Luckily, reversing the rise in popularity of sugary drinks is still possible, if we act now and attack the problem from different angles. One of the very first steps should be educating people on the health risks associated with high sugar intake so that they can make better-informed decisions when selecting what type of beverage they consume. Companies should also be held accountable by law for their misleading marketing campaigns aimed at children and teenagers who are more likely to believe the false claims about their products’ health benefits without fully understanding what’s being sold to them. Schools, colleges and universities, and any institutions catering for young people, should consider banning sugary drinks and replacing them with refreshing alternatives without added sugar.Overall, it is important that we recognise the potential health risks posed by consuming too much sugar from soft drinks and take actionable steps towards reversing this trend in order to ensure our long-term wellbeing. Through greater education, government regulation, and increased corporate responsibility we can ensure that more people understand why reducing their intake of sugary beverages is important while still allowing them to access enjoyable yet healthier options.; A major reason for the increased consumption of sugar-based drinks is the fact that companies are trying to increase the consumption of sugar-based drinks through aggressive advertising. The increase in consumption is not only dangerous for the human body, but also leads to the development of psychological problems. The availability of sugar-based drinks in fast-food restaurants and vending machines makes the consumption of sugar-based drinks even more acceptable. The social media, which are endorsing sugar-based drinks, also increases the desire to consume them. Also, it is an economic factor that sugar-based drinks are cheaper than other healthy beverages such as bottled water and natural fruit juices, so people on a tight budget tend to buy sugar-based drinks. This is especially true for people with lower incomes, who tend to have a tight budget. People can counteract the increase in sugar-based drinks by various measures. One measure is to inform people about the health risks of drinking too much sugar-based drinks, which are obesity, diabetes and dental problems. In countries where this measure has been introduced, consumption of sugar-based drinks has fallen. Also, it is important that future generations set health as a priority for the sake of their children. Moreover, it is useful to promote healthier drinks in schools and other institutions to teach young people better drinking habits.
1259;More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Over the past decades, it has been registered a considerable decrease in the percentage of people eager to create a family at a young age. There could be different reasons for this and I am going to state them clearly in the following paragraphs, which will also explain why I believe the advantages of this situation far outweigh the disadvantages.Apparently, the society we currently live in has undergone substantial changes over the years, sometimes without us even noticing it. The most evident of these variations has probably been the gradual rise in the number of old people as opposed to the dramatic fall in the number of births. In fact, owing to the decline of the economy of most nations and the subsequent reduction of work opportunities, more and more people are giving up on the idea of becoming parents in their 20s or 30s. Many people see this as a negative aspect for our society; however, I have to strongly disagree with their opinion.The drawbacks to which a lot of people point out when discussing about these kind of topics often has to do with the age gap between parents and their children. Admittedly, someone cannot decide to have a child in their 40s without considering the significant generation gap that would separate them from their kids and, as a result, the issues of miscommunication that could arise.However, the disadvantages become of secondary importance as soon as the much more remarkable benefits are examined. First of all, older parents also means more responsible and mature caretakers; consequently, due to their broader life experience, they would arguably make better advisors for their kids. Not to mention that older parents would not only have more stable and secure jobs, but they would also have more consistent savings to devote to their children's further education, which in turn could help the latter having a better and well-paid job in the future.To conclude, although it's impossible not to take into account the drawbacks of having a child at a more advanced age, the advantages still outrun the disadvantages. Thus, children would be the first to benefit from such a situation."; More and more people in the West today have decided to have children at a later age than previous generations. This can be attributed to a number of factors, including better educational and career opportunities, better health care and changes in societal attitudes. For example, advances in maternal health care have reduced many of the risks associated with pregnancy and childbirth in later life, which used to be much more severe. In particular, many women are choosing to complete their studies and develop their careers before starting a family. This gives them the financial security and personal fulfillment that they can then use to raise their children. Couples are also more prepared, both financially and emotionally, when they do have children. Moreover, the way we perceive family life has changed. In the past, we had a strong social pressure to marry and have children at a younger age, but nowadays we encourage our children to develop themselves as people and as professionals before deciding to have children. While this may be an advantage in the long run, it does come with some disadvantages. The main disadvantage is that delaying parenthood increases the chances of infertility, complicating pregnancy and complicating the health of both mother and child. In the end, however, the advantages of delayed parenthood outweigh the disadvantages, as long as we are fully informed and prepared for the responsibilities that come with raising children. In conclusion, while delaying parenthood has many advantages, such as financial security and personal fulfillment, it does come with its own set of disadvantages, such as the health risks and the generation gap.
1425;Most high level positions in companies are filled by men, even though the workforce in many developed countries consists of 50 percent female workers. Companies should be required to allocate a certain percentage of management positions to women. Discuss, what is your opinion?;"The inequality between men and women has always been a significant issue in society. , it is undeniable that most vital positions in companies are taken by males, not females. Therefore, that companies should allocate to women a certain number of these positions. However, I do not agree with this requirement completely.In some feudal countries, it was true to say that the society the males, and at that time instances of inequality occurred very frequently. Up until the present moment, it in some developing countries; also it is greatly . A large number of women in these countries are not allowed to go to work or even go to . In this case, this is not an individual issue, but social problem. The governments should have some solution to this tendency, and at the same time they should promulgate a new legislation to protect women’s .On the other hand, the global economy is developing rapidly nowadays. In most corporations, distinguish men from women; they only focus on working efficiently. In this world, any employees who possess enough abilities and work in an effective way, be promoted to positions. Therefore, allocating the high level positions in companies to women is not necessary. Moreover, the instances of women in essential positions . Those women are very successful in their work and their lives.In conclusion, although the inequality between men and women has reduced, it still is a social issue worth . Personally, in my opinion we should create as many opportunities for women to have an equal life as we can."; However, while in developed countries women constitute approximately half of the workforce, they remain significantly outnumbered in the number of managerial positions, raising the question of whether the traditional system of hiring is equitable and effective. Qualified women face a subconscious bias in the hiring process, where their capacity for success is sometimes unfairly compared to that of their male counterparts. This, and other systemic barriers, hinder women’s advancement. For these reasons, I support the proposal that companies should be required to allocate a certain percentage of management positions to women, a move that could initiate a necessary change in the cultural milieu of a company. In addition, studies have shown that gender diversity among top management can lead to better decision-making and enhanced financial performance. By guaranteeing a certain percentage of management positions to women, companies can establish a level playing field that enables the most talented people to achieve their full potential. Although some argue that the quota system could result in tokenism and undermine merit, it is important to recognize that talent is not gender-based. The commitment to diversity should not dilute the quality of hires, but rather expand the definition of talent to include diverse experiences and backgrounds. In short, increasing female representation in leadership positions not only serves social justice, but also promotes economic efficiency. Moreover, quotas may be a controversial solution, but they can be an effective tool to instill greater equity and promote a more diverse workplace.
1390;News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in a newspaper. What factors do you think influence their decisions? Do we become used to bad news? Would it be better if more good news was reported?;. There are two factors that influence their decisions. The first is the kind of customers they aim at. each kind of readers and watchers has its own features. For example, if your customers are almost entirely teenagers, you have to concentrate on something attracting them such as stories, photographs of singer stars, film stars, funny tales, and fashion. It be very silly if you to provide teenagers with economic or news. On the contrary, and politicians may never read news about James Blunt or Keira Knightley. Therefore, what influences news editors’ decisions the most is the taste of their customers.The second factor is how hot and attractive the news is. Who or watch news from a year or a month ago or even about something that happened last week? The answer is . In the energetic and competitive world nowadays, people always ask for a really news. So that to satisfy customers, there is a pressure on all editors to find continually what has already happened not only yesterday but even an hour ago. Or else, they may lose their customers. None of editors wants that bleak future.The type of news is also an important consideration. Whether on television or in newspapers, we seem to get more of and become used to bad news. It is harder for us to come across a piece of good news. We can’t deny that bad things happen on Earth day by day. However, news editors try to gain more and more , which means more and more money, using bad news as a magnet. bad news makes us curious. We want to know why it is bad, what it is about, whether it influences us or not. As a result, we will buy newspapers or watch television to find out. And the happiest people are, of course, news editors.In my view it would be better if more good news reported. Bad news makes us good news makes us happy. There should an an equal amount of good and bad news. In that way we can give something bad a lot of thought while still being happy about the good news. Any inequalities between good news and bad news should be avoided. Nowadays we cannot live without news, and for that reason the role of news editors became very important. We should support them, and in turn they should try their best to provide us with useful news, both good and bad.; Editors are particularly concerned to attract readers or viewers. They have to weigh a number of factors, including the importance of the news, the public reaction, and the content of the news itself. In addition, they are keenly aware of the present social and political climate and are likely to emphasize, for example, a public health crisis or an ecological disaster, when public concern is greatest. Public reaction to the news is also an important factor. If people are given the opportunity to listen to or read only the sensational or dramatic, they will often be more likely to read or watch things like crime reports or scandals. The news media do have an important function in drawing public attention to events which demand public action, but too much bad news can encourage people to take a negative view of the world, and so less likely to try to make a positive change. Continual exposure to bad news can also lead to apathy, so that news becomes less emotional. Positive news, by contrast, gives people hope and a feeling of community. In such a context, it is important to call for a more equitable representation of good news. If the media included more good news, it would contribute to a more balanced coverage and make people feel better about the world. Reporting acts of kindness, community achievements, or scientific achievements could enliven a community and encourage positive action.
1321;Newspapers have a significant influence on people’s ideas and opinions. Why is this happening? Is it a positive or negative situation?;Many people believe that newspapers play a pivotal role in shaping the way we think. There are numerous ways in which this affects our society, and I believe that this influence is mostly negative.Newspapers have long been a source of valuable information that has kept societies abreast of the latest happenings in the world. Since the average citizen has minimal knowledge about the information in expert analysis articles, well-established newspapers are powerfully poised to form public opinion through attention-grabbing images and carefully worded commentary. This leaves the reader no choice but to trust the accuracy of what they have read.Sadly, unbiased objectivity, which used to be the core idea behind journalism, seems to be a thing of the past. The arrival and spread of social media platforms has caused a gradual decline in print media subscriptions and their circulation, since readers tend to favor the internet and social media to stay informed about current affairs. This gave rise to a worrying trend of newspapers using sensationalist and controversial tactics to improve their sales. As a result, the constant barrage of bad news has led to a society that sees itself as more vulnerable and powerless than ever. To make matters worse, there are plenty of well-documented instances where newspapers have been used to spread false propaganda which is usually politically motivated.All in all, although newspapers are our lifeline to the world around us, the recent trend of publishing misinformation has had a mostly negative impact on readers. It is my hope that newspapers will go back to publishing impartial accounts of the latest news in the future.; First of all, newspapers have the ability to form the narratives of the event and the issue, which makes the reader understand the course of events and issues. Secondly, the newspapers have the opportunity to form the public discussion, and in the newspapers, as a major source of information, they can form public opinion and social attitudes. In this case, newspapers can form the discussion in the form of letters, commentary, and other opinions. Thirdly, newspapers often use the editorials to express their opinions and positions. Through the selection of news, the presentation of news, and the position of the editorial, the newspapers guide readers' views and influence their views and attitudes. But the influence of newspapers is also two-sided. This is a discussion platform that allows people to discuss different views, so that people have more understanding and understanding, and the community is more cohesive. The influence of newspapers is mostly in a positive way. If newspapers pay attention to objectivity, and do not indulge in sensationalism, partiality, and distortion, then they can promote public awareness, and citizens will pay attention to and understand the development of the country and the world, and will advocate reform and re-election, and supervise the government. In this way, he can cultivate a public that is aware and busy, and at the same time, he can also make a challenge to the ethics of journalism. Otherwise, it is easy to create a polarized public opinion and affect the public's trust in the media. In the end, whether it is a positive or a negative phenomenon depends on the degree to which newspapers uphold their responsibilities to inform and guide.
1391;Nowadays environmental problems are too big to be managed by individual persons or individual countries. In other words, it is an international problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;An essential problem of the 21st century is world pollution. Currently the environment is so contaminated that urgent measures should be taken. A single individual cannot be blamed for the world pollution, however every person should take care of his or her habitat. In addition, it is vital that environmental issues are treated internationally.Lately, many presentations, conferences and international summits are held to deal with waste treatment, recycling, and soil and water contamination. joint efforts and consolidation can only help in the mutual war the ongoing environmental disaster. For instance, governments should offer support to companies and organizations, involved in manufacturing, industry or agriculture in order to find environment-friendly approaches. These could be special law regulations, recycling programs, helping courses in order to implement ISO certificates and many more.However, the influence of individuals over environment should not be ignored. If we do not that our planet is our home, we will never be able to take care of it. We have to contribute every day to the preservation of nature and environment. For example, always remember to save energy by switching off lamps, computers and everything that we do not use. Our next obligation is to separate waste and throw bulk only in the designated areas. Driving vehicles can also be environment friendly. For example, we have to avoid accelerating the engines too rapidly or using the air conditioning in the country, where it would be better to save energy and simply open the windows.To sum up, environmental problems should be handled by local and international authorities as well as individuals. Every single person should take care of the environment, moreover we have to bring up our children to be conscious citizens of a clean and preserved planet.; Firstly, many of the problems, such as climate change, deforestation and sea pollution, are very large. I strongly agree that these problems need to be solved together, because no one can solve them by themselves. If the rich countries are continuing to pollute the environment, it is difficult for other countries to keep up. In the long run, only the world's largest countries can make a difference. Many of the problems are closely related, such as the depletion of natural resources, the disappearance of biological diversity and the dumping of plastic garbage in the seas. In addition, the environment often includes complex relationships and systems that do not belong to one country. Moreover, many developing countries do not have enough wealth to cope with the degradation of their environment. Richer countries should help them with money and technology to help them to implement sustainable practices. The United Nations and international agreements such as the Paris Agreement are a sign of this awareness. It is clear that the scale and complexity of the world's modern environment problems call for an international solution. Individual efforts are insufficient, because the solution requires broad international cooperation. Cooperation also shows that not only does the environment play a role in economic development, but also in the creation of international justice. It is important to realize that in order to maintain the health of the planet, one has to act together and this is a great responsibility for all states.
1368;Nowadays families move to different countries for work and some think it has a negative effect on children (agree/disagree);Nowadays families move to different countries for work. Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Recent advancements, in technology and transportation in particular, are reshaping our world in an unprecedented manner. Nowadays, it is not unusual for people to work abroad. Most expatriates relocate their families to the countries . Some people argue that this phenomenon negatively affects children, however, I agree with those who believe the opposite is true.Those who think that relocating children to a new place is undesirable do so for many reasons. Their most common argument is the negative impact of moving on a child’s personality. There is no doubt that living in a different community comes with its challenges, especially to young people, as they get exposed to behaviours, actions and customs they might not be familiar with. As a result, children could possibly feel a lack of stability and some confusion. It is also likely that their patriotic feelings and sense of belonging to their home country could weaken as they would miss many opportunities to celebrate their national events.Nevertheless, I firmly believe that opinion to be ludicrous, as it seems that getting exposed to a new culture is beneficial in many ways. It fosters young social and emotional capabilities. Moreover, children living abroad have better opportunities to and practice new languages. Mastering more than one language improves not only their intellectual development, but also their opportunities in acquiring better jobs in the future. According to a recent study published by the University of Chicago, competency in more than one language increases employment chances on average by 200%.In conclusion, I strongly believe that living in a different country positively affects children in all aspects. Acquiring new languages, and an open minded and tolerant personality are just few examples of the many possible benefits.This essay presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt. The writer’s ideas are relevant and well‐supported. The arrangement of information and use of cohesive devices are fine, perhaps with a slight overuse in the second body paragraph. Sentence structures are complex, and the vocabulary is varied and appropriately used, except for some minor grammatical/spelling mistakes. This essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.; The benefits of moving to a new country are obvious. Firstly, the child will get a new perspective on the world, which will help him learn more about life in the world. Secondly, relocating abroad will give children access to better education. This international cultural exchange is vital for the development of children and can lead to a future in which everyone in the world lives in harmony. Moreover, there is a benefit in that the child becomes more flexible, which is useful in his future education and career. Many families have moved abroad because they are looking for better education or more specific educational programs. Although it is understandable that it is not easy for children to leave their friends and familiar things behind, they can also develop more resilience and flexibility through the frequent adjustment of the environment, school and friends, which will not only help them overcome the difficulties of the future but also help them in dealing with a variety of problems. In short, moving to a different country for work can have a great influence on children, but the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages. In addition, parents must provide support during the adjustment process and make sure that their children are not easily lost in their new surroundings.
1350;Nowadays many people choose ready-made food and refuse to cook at home, why and what are the advantages/disadvantages?;Nowadays many people choose ready-made food and refuse to cook at home. Why do you think it happens? What are the advantages and disadvantages of such a choice?It is a very popular practice in the modern society to order ready-made food from restaurants, rather than cooking at home. The main reasons for such a tendency may be cheap prices in some restaurants and people’s desire to save some time . Even though ordering food some obvious advantages, its disadvantages should not be underestimated.On the one hand, ordering prepared food may be the best choice for a busy person, who does not have time for cooking and cleaning. Cooking food at home requires a considerable amount of time, moreover the cleaning process may take even more time and resources than cooking itself. For example, cooking a simple dish such as chicken with rice home requires significant amounts of water and electricity for electrical appliances such as the oven and dishwasher. Hence, having an opportunity to order food from a restaurant will save a lot of time, electricity and water.On the other hand, delegating the process of cooking to some restaurant a dramatic disadvantage of not having the information about the ingredients used in the meals. With high demand, grow the volumes of required products, which sometimes can affect the quality of purchased produce. For example, it is a very common practice in some restaurants to make salads from products that are about to go bad and mask the rotten scent by adding some chemicals and spices. Hence, some restaurants may use poor quality products or chemicals for boosting taste and preservatives, which may have a negative effect on the customer’s health in the long run.In conclusion, ordering food from restaurants may be a tempting choice for people who have no time for cooking at home, but this approach has a critical disadvantage of being not informed about the ingredients used in the meal, which can have destructive consequences.This response covers the task requirements by giving a reason why people would choose to buy ready-made food and discussing the advantages and disadvantages of this trend. The ideas are conveyed quite clearly and supported by examples, paragraphing helps to present the information in a neat and easy to follow way, and the level of coherence is adequate in this essay. A range of complex sentence forms and advanced vocabulary is used and there are very few instances of erroneous grammar or inaccurate expressions (see corrections underlined in blue). Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.; What causes this shift from cooking to ready-made food, which brings both advantages and disadvantages, is the hectic pace of modern life. .. In addition, a wider range of ready-made products and various cuisines are presented in stores and in restaurants, which encourages consumers to choose convenience over homemade cooking. With the long working hours and many cares, people would rather buy a ready-made dish than cook at home. Many ready-made dishes are designed to be nutritionally balanced and to offer a quick solution for people who may not have the time or knowledge to prepare a healthy diet themselves. The advantages of ready-made food are clear: above all, they save time, which can be spent on more important things, for example, on work, family or entertainment. This is why the younger generations are more receptive to these convenience foods. However, there are significant disadvantages to this trend. First of all, there is the fear of losing the ability to cook, especially in the younger generation. A balance between the convenience of ready-made food and the pleasure and benefits of home cooking can bring people health and happiness. Finally, many ready-made dishes contain a lot of preservatives, unhealthy fats and salts that can seriously affect health over time.
1316;Nowadays many teenagers have a celebrity who they follow as a role model. Some people think this is not a good idea, because celebrities often set a bad example. Do you agree or disagree?;It is not uncommon for teenagers to worship celebrities. From singers to actors, many young people around the world look up to these stars and attempt to emulate their lifestyles. In my opinion, allowing children to idolize celebrities can often be detrimental, as they frequently set a poor example.Many of today’s celebrities tend to lack moral values, and they promote behaviour inappropriate for young people. For instance, some music videos feature explicit lyrics glorifying drug use and violence. In addition, the media often reports on celebrities who indulge in excessive partying or drinking alcohol despite being underage. These types of headlines can have a negative influence on impressionable teens who might falsely believe that they should follow suit to appear cool or successful.Poor morals aren’t the only issue, as many popular stars are also well-known for their irresponsible spending habits. They routinely splurge on luxury items such as designer clothing or expensive cars without any consideration for budgeting or saving money responsibly. This kind of behaviour is dangerous because it is normalizing materialism and teaching teens that costly possessions will bring them happiness instead of focusing on what really matters in life: meaningful relationships, knowledge, and hard work.To conclude, young adults should keep in mind that society’s perception of fame and fortune is based on temporary, insubstantial things rather than what actually matters. In the grand scheme of things, it would be far more beneficial for teenagers to spend time developing their own set of values rooted in quality education and strong family relationships.; True, some celebrities show bad examples like an unhealthy lifestyle, alcoholism or superficiality. But it is difficult to reject the influence of celebrities completely. In addition, the media, especially the tabloid press, often distort reality, glorify celebrities and their lives, and ignore the consequences of their behavior. The actions of celebrities can make impressionable teenagers think that this behavior is the norm. On the other hand, some celebrities are philanthropic, humanitarian, and support the concept of social justice, such as Emma Watson and Leonardo DiCaprio. Such people can encourage teenagers to do good and make them aware of their responsibilities. Teaching critical thinking to teenagers is important. Then they can make a distinction between what they want to imitate and what they want to reject. The responsibility lies not only with celebrities, but also with teenagers and their parents. However, by encouraging critical thinking and by emphasizing positive examples, it is possible to help teenagers deal with the difficult phenomenon of celebrity and to use it to further personal development and social awareness. In conclusion, it is too easy to reject all influence of celebrities as harmful.
1359;Nowadays more and more people want to live by themselves, why is this happening?;Nowadays more and more people want to live by themselves. What are the reasons? Is it a positive or negative trend?These days a vast majority of people want to lead an independent life. The fundamental reason lies in people’s educational qualifications that fuel their craving for freedom in life. This can be seen as a positive trend because living alone is likely to nurture a mature mindset at early stages of one’s life.Many people are well educated to stand up on their own. Tertiary education broadens their horizons, and they wish to experience freedom of life. With a very good educational background it becomes easier to find a well-paid job, and with lucrative income they gain confidence to lead an independent life, thereby achieving their goals. For example, engineering graduates can find a job in another town and their salary is enough for them to move and settle down there. This enables them to move away from their family and live on their own.Living alone helps one to develop maturity, which can be seen as a positive impact on individuals and the society as a whole. Being independent means young people have to face life challenges alone and going through this process improves their resilience. They become more responsible, as they have to take care of themselves and develop budgeting skills and saving habits, for their future needs as well. Better planning of their finances nurtures the custom of wise spending at early stages of adult life.In conclusion, the reason why many people wish to live independently these days is because their education level gives them both the awareness of freedom in life and means of achieving it. Since living alone promotes one’s maturity, it seems to be a positive trend in today’s society.This response covers the task requirements by addressing the two parts of the question, why people choose to live alone and whether this is a positive trend. The ideas are clearly explained and supported, the information is organised in paragraphs in an easy to follow way, and the level of coherence is adequate. A range of complex sentence forms is used and there are no grammatical errors. Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.; The occurrence of this phenomenon is related to several interrelated factors, including technological advances, changes in social customs, and individual desires. For example, there is a noticeable increase in the number of people who want to live alone in recent years. Moreover, the fact that the society is more tolerant of living alone is also a factor. The rise of e-commerce, the convenience of food delivery, and the appearance of smart home appliances all reduced the need to live with others. In addition, the media is increasingly promoting the concept of solitary living as an enriching and liberating life choice, rather than a shameful alternative. In the past, the idea of cohabitation and multi-generational families was more common in many societies, but it is now less common, especially for young people. The individuality of personal development and freedom are more important to young people than the family's expectations. As a result, the freedom of choice and the space to think and grow, which can be obtained by living alone, has become more and more important. As a result, the interest in living alone has increased, and the tendency towards independence and self-sufficiency in society will be more and more prominent. This self-reliance is often considered the way to realize oneself.

This essay will explain the reason why the people are spending more time;"popular hobbies rather than their individual activities.Hobbies and are different for everyone; this is the human nature,. The current generations are very much in the latest trend which makes them happy and also them to make more money.

The first reason is that the media plays an important role in shaping the habits and preferences of people. Secondly, the desire for the popularity of people is important. Thirdly, the people who are surrounded by the media are trying to do things that the media shows them. Such as fashion, fitness, food, etc., on platforms like Instagram, TikTok and Twitter, new trends are often disseminated and spread quickly. People who are trying to create their own self-expression are often busy with such activities to attract likes, followers and so on. Secondly, because people are inherently social animals, they all want to be connected and popular. In order to meet the requirements of public image, people have to spend more time and effort on the trend, and sometimes ignore their own interests. And they are more likely to be obsessed with trends and change their behavior accordingly. Whether it's participating in a popular challenge or trying out a popular hobby, it is often the fear of missing out (FOMO) and the desire to be part of the group that makes people want to participate. The people who are more interested in the trend feel closer to the public and want to be popular, which is a vicious circle. Thirdly, in a consumer culture, advertising and marketing strategies are often used to create urgency for new products and lifestyles, which in turn encourage people to participate in the trend to satisfy the expectations of others. The more the technology and society develop, the more external influences will affect people's individual preferences and individual personalities. In conclusion, people's desire to change their daily activities according to the trend is due to the media, the desire for popularity and the influence of consumer culture.
701;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. In this essay, the reason for wasting food and the acts which can be done by humans to reduce the amount of food one throws away will be thorougly discussed.Firstly, people waste food as one tends to be satisfied with the amount one eats. Thus, people order food more than one can eat as one can not estimate the amount of food. The amount of food one person can consume differs on one's conditions at that moment. The conditions include mood, physical features and activities one did on that particular day. Furthermore, one wants to taste all sorts of food, however, one can not eat all of those. Sometimes, people order food which are well decorated just to take a photo of it and upload it on social media such as Instagram. After taking photo, people just leave the food. The above mentioned reasons can be the causes of wastage of food.Apparently, people can reduce the amount of food they throw away. The restaurants can provide more informations about the amount and taste briefly to avoid the situation that consumers can not finish the food and are dissatisfied with the taste or smell. Moreover, consumers have to make a wise decision so that they do not waste both food and money. People should co-operate to reduce the wastage of food as it causes pollution on land. It leads to bad smell and brings insects to the areas.Conclusively, it is quite clear that people greatly waste food and there are a few ways for people to follow so as to reduce the amount of waste food.; First, people waste food because of excessive buying, which is a result of the way consumers behave. This has become a serious social problem, and it can be prevented by addressing the root causes of the problem. For example, buying in bulk in order to save money is a common practice, but this can result in food being wasted because it spoils before it can be eaten. Moreover, many people buy more food than they can eat, for example, because of a special offer, a discount, and so on. To solve this problem, several strategies can be used. Firstly, education should be a priority. People should be educated about the problems caused by food waste and how to plan their menus and shop with purpose. People need to be taught to think about food as a resource that can be thrown away and not just used up, so that they will not buy food that they will not eat, which is a waste of both money and resources. Secondly, shops and restaurants should adopt practices that will reduce food waste. For example, they could sell half portions or offer customers the opportunity to order their own portion size. Also, people should learn to plan their menus and shop according to what they have already bought. Food stores could sell foods that are about to go out of date for less money to encourage customers to buy them. Finally, the food industry should ensure that its practices and products are sustainable and do not damage the environment. There are several ways to reduce food waste: educating consumers and encouraging people to think about what they buy, reorganizing how restaurants and shops operate, and regulating the way food is produced.
1354;Nowadays people waste a lot of food, why is this happening and how to reduce waste?;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?At the time when famines heavily strike impoverished third world countries, many people living in wealthy countries waste tremendous amounts of food daily. In my opinion, understanding the probable reasons of this phenomenon is important and may lead us to some applicable solutions that will result in reducing food waste.The low cost of food seems to be one of the obvious reasons, exacerbating the problem. Due to the revolutionary technological achievements, people have increased both the quality and the quantity of their crops. In turn, according to the laws of supply and demand, the prices of the crops have immensely dropped. A recent study of the FAO stated that the global crops prices have dropped 50 per cent over the last decade. This enabled people to buy excessive amounts of food without a real need.Furthermore, the absence of strict regulations to discourage or punish this attitude can also be considered a major cause. Not everyone is aware that wasting food may create problems. Consequently, they are likely to resist any calls for controlling the consumption of dietary supplies unless they are forced by the power of law. Several countries in the world saw a drop in their national food waste after implementing a ban on the excessive purchasing of food.Fortunately, there are some possible approaches that can be adopted by both people and governments. Firstly, raising the awareness of this issue is immensely important. Using social media platforms can draw public attention to the potential dangers of food waste and how communities can confront it. Secondly, enforcing laws that prohibit the wasting of food by people and companies will deter such harmful practice.In conclusion, the decreased price of food as well as lack of regulations allowed the unfortunate trend of throwing away food to continue. I believe that creating awareness and legislation are parts of a straightforward solution to this issue.The writer explored the reasons for throwing away food and suggested some solutions, effortlessly conveying his/her ideas in this well-written IELTS essay. The information is presented in an orderly, logical and coherent way. A wide range of vocabulary is used in this written response. The sentence structures are varied and the vocabulary is impressive. Overall, this essay could achieve IELTS Band 8.;" There are several reasons for this alarming phenomenon. Over the past decade, food waste has become an important issue in the world, reflecting both social customs and inefficiencies in the system. Food waste is estimated to be between 30 and 40 percent of all food produced for human consumption. A number of factors contribute to this, including consumers’ shopping habits, where they buy more food than they can consume, due to the promotion of mass purchases and savings, causing people to buy more than they need, and a misunderstanding of the expiration date of the food, which can lead to the fact that the food is still edible, but is no longer edible. In order to reduce the waste of food, a multifaceted approach is needed. There is a need for education and awareness campaigns aimed at consumers. They can greatly contribute to promoting a more responsible buying habit. The cultural aspect of a perception of beauty is also involved in the fact that many consumers are rejecting food with spots and ""imperfections"", despite the fact that it is very nutritious. Also, the development of a kitchen culture, the use of leftovers and other unused food scraps, can encourage the culture of frugality. At the same time, it is also important for producers and wholesalers to change their own behavior. They need to teach people to properly read the label and plan their purchases. The use of the so-called ugly fruit and vegetables strategy and a wider food distribution system are also needed. In addition, it is important to increase the level of donations of excess food and to provide assistance to the poor and needy in order to reduce the amount of wasted food. In conclusion, food waste is a complex problem that requires the combined efforts of consumers, wholesalers and policy makers. It can be solved with greater awareness, with a change in buying behavior and with the use of innovation."
1351;Nowadays that many women have full time jobs, it is logical to share the housework evenly between men and women (agree/disagree);Nowadays in many countries women have full time jobs. Therefore, it is logical to share household tasks evenly between men and women. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Nowadays an ever-increasing number of women work full time, and in this reality it is widely believed that house chores should be shared between men and women equally. I strongly agree with this statement.One of the reasons for sharing housework between is to promote gender equality. A stereotype that has existed a long time is that females ought to stay home, taking care of the family once they got married. This includes looking after the children and doing all of the housework, which is fairly labour-intensive. However, this approach could have quite a few disadvantages. It would render women less able of keeping abreast of what is happening in the job market, thus forming a lifestyle where they might find it arduous to step into the society again. To avoid this, many women are willing to get back into the workforce soon after their maternity leave, and once they do, it makes sense that their husbands should share part of the household chores, to fulfill their family responsibilities.Nevertheless, we cannot be oblivious several drawbacks of this trend. One potential downside is that men are less experienced in dealing with household tasks. This is because many seldom take an active role in doing housework, according to customs of many countries. As a result, they may end up doing household tasks in a less than perfect way, which could contribute to some unnecessary quarrels between partners, hindering their family bond. However, the likelihood of this happening isn’t very high, because wives can offer some tips or guidance to their husbands when they learn how to share house chores such as mopping floors or doing laundry.To sum up, although some conflicts might be triggered when equally sharing the duties of household tasks, the benefits of this trend are relatively oblivious.The writer covered the task well by discussing the positives and negatives of sharing housework equally between men and women. Each paragraph has a clear purpose and assists with orderly presentation of ideas, making this essay easy to follow. The ideas are explained and substantiated, and the writer’s opinion is clear. The range of vocabulary is wide enough to avoid unnecessary repetition. Accuracy of expression could be improved (see corrections underlined in blue), but all in all this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.; To divide household chores between women and men is a logical idea and it corresponds to the principles of equality and fairness. In our society, household chores are undergoing major changes, especially as more and more women take on full-time jobs. When both partners participate in the housework, they have a healthier and more friendly relationship. The old ideas that household chores were only for women are no longer valid, so it is logical to distribute the household chores between men and women. The sharing of housework also has a positive impact on the family as children who see their parents sharing responsibilities tend to internalize equality, which can have a positive impact on the next generation. It also gives the couple a sense of satisfaction, because they both feel valued and take care of their home environment. Some people argue that biological differences or traditional roles justify that women have more household chores than men. But these ideas are increasingly challenged by the concept of equality and shared responsibility. Children who are taught that both genders have an important role in the household are less likely to learn gender stereotypes and thus promote more equality in the future. Therefore, it is not only logical, but necessary that men and women share household chores. It is not biologically justified, but a modern one, and it should be based on agreements and not outdated ideas. A more healthy and well-being in the family will ultimately benefit the family and society as a whole.
25;Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?;"It is a serious problem that there is an inadequate number of students who tend to select science as their major subject in universities in many countries. In my view, students may think that studying science has not a good career path. Also, this issue may deeply affect the international state of a country.The main reason why people do not think to study science is that they may see science as something unpractical, and potentially, they are hard to find a job when they graduate. Students are generally afraid that there is no employment opportunity after they graduate from university. Unlike engineering and business management, in which fields employers provide plenty of vocational positions for graduated students because there are lots of companies activating in these fields and universities may provide some practical training courses and internships. Students studying science have a relatively narrow way to walk, and may just be scientists. Moreover, although a successful scientist can get a massive bonus from some prizes, it is too hard to accomplish and is more likely to fail. Therefore, Students will avoid taking those risks and choose other subjects that are relatively stable and easy to find a job.This trend will eventually decrease the state of a country. Developing science can provide a strong and firm foundation for a country to establish a healthy and prosperous community. If there are not enough scientists, the whole scientific ability will decrease. Not only will the government pay extra money to other foreign countries to buy the required technology such as military equipment, but the public needs to spend more time and pay more effort to maintain the international standard production rate of a country. It is extremely dangerous that a nation easily suffers from a financial crisis and, finally, it influences the living standard of its citizens and causes damage to its financial systems.In summary, while science is regarded as a ""useless"" subject because of its narrow career path and low success rate, it is vital that the economic systems would be affected if a country develop without scientists."; In recent years there has been a decline in the number of students who choose university courses in natural sciences and technology in many countries. The background to this development is that science and technology form the foundation of modern society. Students are often intimidated by the amount of material to be learned and the complexity of the mathematical foundations. Many students prefer to study humanities and vocations that are perceived as more practical and relevant to everyday life. One important reason for this is the students' view of the natural sciences and technology as difficult and demanding subjects. It may also be that they are influenced by their family and peers, who see natural sciences as less attractive than jobs in the business world or in the culture industry. It is also true that the prestige of the university courses in business, law and arts is sometimes greater than that of the university courses in the natural sciences and technology. This attitude has great repercussions for society. The decline in the number of science graduates leads to a lack of experts with the right competence to cope with the world's major challenges, such as climate change, infectious diseases and technological development. These societal influences are combined with the lure of a higher salary in the business world, law and the arts, which can discourage students from choosing university courses in natural sciences and technology. In conclusion, there are many different social, educational and cultural factors that influence the lack of students who choose natural sciences and technology. The lack of scientific competence can hamper progress in important areas, and lead to a slower development in medicine, environment and other essential areas. The reduced focus on science education can also lead to a less informed society that is less able to participate in the discussion of scientific issues and therefore compromise democratic decision-making. If society does not pay attention to this problem, it may compromise its ability to develop and respond to future challenges.
1361;Obesity is becoming common among children, give reasons and solutions (from Target Band ;"This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskObesity was once considered a disease of adults; however, it is becoming increasingly common among children. Why do you think this is happening? What can be done to help children stay healthy?Write at least 250 wordsFor many years obesity was perceived as a condition occurring only in adult life. However, in recent years the number of children suffering from obesity has grown significantly. There are several causes and numerous solutions which can be used to tackle this worrying phenomenon, and this essay will present a couple of them.While some reasons for childhood obesity are genetic, others include poor food choices exacerbated by easy availability of fast food, insufficient physical activity and a history of family members being overweight. Unlike the former, the latter factors can be changed, if the adults in the child’s life gain awareness and are willing to take action.To begin with, health is a complex matter which requires a balanced approach. In other words, there isn’t a single solution to maintain health, on the contrary, it is rather a mixture of multiple factors, such as and regular physical activity. For this reason, increasing the awareness of healthy habits among children is a responsibility of utmost importance. What is more, it can be easily achieved through the education system.On the other hand, children’s education might to stop the situation from worsening. Along with well designed health education schemes, we should also try to stop food companies from overusing sugar in products the young ones. It has been proven that more than 70% of the products available in an average supermarket contain dangerously high levels of white sugar. Sugar rich diet not only causes a significant weight gain, but also contributes to diseases, such as diabetes in young population.To summarize, emphasis put on the awareness of healthy living among children is invaluable. Furthermore, combining healthy habits with stopping food companies from in products which are easily children can be effectively implemented by the governments. Positive outcomes of such measures taken today will definitely have a long lasting effect on the future generations.This is a well developed response to the question. Relevant key points are included in the answer. Appropriate examples are also used to corroborate the writer’s point of view. Paragraphing is skillfully managed, information and ideas are logically sequenced. A wide range of vocabulary is used to allow certain flexibility and precision. Also, a variety of sentence structures is used. Accuracy of expression needs some attention (see corrections underlined in blue). Overall, the essay could achieve Band 8 in IELTS."; One). In recent years, there has been a global increase in the alarming rate of childhood obesity. The main reason for this alarming increase is that childhood obesity is associated with the rise in the rate of sedentary life. In addition, the nutritional habits of children have also changed greatly over the past few decades. Children have become accustomed to a lot of time to play on the screens of the device, watch a movie or browse the Internet. Sports and active games have also become an unusual thing for children. Parents have become accustomed to choosing fast and easy meals that are low in nutrients for their children. Children often like sweets and high-calorie snacks more than fruits, vegetables and other nutritious foods. Firstly, the education of children and their families about healthy food habits is very important. Schools should set up courses on healthy nutrition for children, focusing on the importance of balanced diets and the benefits of eating fruits and vegetables. To combat childhood obesity, a combination of different methods should be used. In addition, parents should be encouraged to cook healthy food at home and limit the availability of unhealthy foods. Secondly, the opportunities for children to exercise should be increased. Schools should also set up courses for physical education and provide children with safe outdoor recreation areas. Also, communities can invest in the construction of public parks and community centers to promote an active lifestyle. In conclusion, childhood obesity is a complex problem that is closely related to the changes in the lifestyle and nutritional habits of the population.
633;People are having more and more sugar-based drinks. What are the reasons? What are the solutions to make people drink less.;In these days,we have more and more suger-based drinks,like juice,coffee,tea and soft drinks.becouse we spend more time out and do diffrent activitys .that make us thirsty then we drink much more when we inside our home.Practically, we are spend more and more of these drinks in our live without a control.when some one drinks that drinks all time ,that make him unhealtheir ,become a fat espacially when he did not get exercises.in our world 90% of people have this bad habite,if we want to the world become healthy,unlisess,and clean .we have to change that bad habits to do more goog habits like do exercises every days in our life ,drink less sugar -based drinks,talk with people about risces for these drinks ,talk with companies to give us more solutions like put less sugar in drinks ,made new kind ofdrinks without sugar.On another hand ,we can talk with the maker desgin in the media .put more advertising on TV,radia ,social network eathier newspaper .so the world knows the dangers of sugar- containing drinks. also we can make charities to help people how are gitting fat becouse these bad habits.At least we can use any body have a publicity to help us at this project.people like to tradition any body famous .we can use those people to learn sociaty a new and good habits.Finally, in our live we have many bad habits we have to do but also we can chang thes bad to new and good habits .to make our life easier,heatheir and longer.Human can do it he want to do eather good nather bad .we can di it eveery thing in this live.; For example: The first reason is the propaganda that the drinks companies use. These companies often use pictures of people having fun, drinking fun, drinking and socializing. It is important to note that these drinks are carefully designed to appeal to a wide audience, especially the younger ones. The combination of sugar and artificial flavors not only gives the drinkers a pleasant taste, but also encourages them to return to this combination. For the consumption of sugar-based drinks, there are several solutions. One of them is the educational campaign that warns people of the health risks of excessive consumption of sugar, such as obesity, diabetes, tooth decay, etc. Sugar-based drinks are also sold cheaper than healthier drinks, such as water or juice. Another solution is to regulate the way sugar-based drinks are advertised, especially those aimed at children and adolescents. Stricter regulations would prevent the young from seeing sugar-based drinks as a fun, friendly and exciting drink. The educational campaign should include social media, schools and social gatherings. Finally, the government can impose taxes on sugar-based drinks, similar to what is already being done in several countries, so that consumers will be encouraged to choose healthier alternatives. All these measures combined would significantly reduce the consumption of sugar-based drinks.
1418;People attend college or university for many different reasons (for example, new experiences, career preparation, or to increase knowledge).;Why do you think people attend college or university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Many people after their high school years for several reason which they choose . I believe that the most common reason why people to have new experiences on life , to prepare for a career, and to increase their knowledge of their personality.Firstly, many people to have new experience in life. Many students leave their home and move to live when they go to university. This is the first time that they had to make a resolution on their own, without their parents’ help. Making their own decisions will increase their knowledge of themselves. Moreover, students university can meet different students from different nationalities and religions so students can learn about different around the world.Secondly, many people go to university or collage to prepare for a career. Career training is becoming more important nowadays to young people compared to old people. At college, students learn many skills for their career and they internship with a lot of chances. All of these prepare them for their career.Also, students attend university or college to increase their self-knowledge of their personality life. They attend increase their knowledge in subjects which they find interesting. For example, many students study science because they are in science but they work .To sum up, I think people should not only focus on a career when they go to university or college. They have to follow to have new experience and knowledge about their personality and the great world around them which they live in.; First, many people choose college because they want to have new experiences. There are a lot of reasons why people attend college, and each is very personal, and sometimes mixed. The diversity of life on campus can be a wonderful experience, where students make new friends, learn new things, develop life skills and develop a new approach to themselves. It is a special time of personal development and independence. Furthermore, the growing competition in the labor market requires effective career preparation, which is the main reason why many students choose college. College gives people specialized knowledge and skills that are necessary for the labor market. These experiences are foundational, because they form character and develop social skills that are useful in both the personal and professional spheres. For many, the experience of working in groups and doing research can be an important stepping stone to a successful career. In addition, college offers internships, networking and career services that can help the career. Degrees in fields such as engineering, nursing and information technology usually provide better opportunities for employment and a higher salary. Higher education encourages critical thinking, analytical skills and creativity, allowing the student to grapple with complex concepts and challenge preconceived ideas. Finally, the desire to learn is a strong reason to attend college. Learning is important, because it develops the student’s mind, and the acquisition of knowledge is important throughout life. In conclusion, people attend college for many different reasons, and these reasons are very personal and sometimes mixed.
1253;People living in large cities have to face many problems in everyday life. What are those problems?Should the government encourage people to move to regional towns?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is not surprise to see that major cities are struggling with various issues which may associate with goverment and public issues as well.These issues are mild in some cities where as severe and vulnerable in few cities.Some of the common problems are increased crime rate,reduced safety,air pollution,noise pollution,flood,mechanical life and reduced greenery.The main cause for the above issues are increased population,uncontrolled carbon emission,poorly planned road and other public facilities such as underground drainage,contaminated water,roads and electricity.In general if the government take steps to control the above mentioned issues by implenting good law and orders which can improve public safety and happiness.Assist the sanitary boards with proper funding which may help to reduce water stagnant during rainy season.Funding for new research and developments may enhance to clear air and water pollution which can bring good health to the local residents.In contrast government may consider to develop the nearest towns with basic facilities such as modern housing,educational advancements,good roads,water and sanitary facilities. These facilities enhance the people to move to smaller town which may enhance to manage the key issues which are currently facing in the major cities.For instance Delhi,Capital of India seriously struggling with severe air pollution and lack of security which is heavily populated.Researches says that these problems can be reduced if the population rate is reduced.Meantime some group of people suggests that if the government may adopt new technology or structure which are following by any successful cities in the world.I personally feels that this also could be a better solution if it can be adopted by the government.By arguing the possitive and negative impacts it is difficult to conclude which option may works better to sove the issues.; Ans. Overpopulation of cities is one of the most important problems that people face, because the city is a place where people usually go to find work and other facilities. Then there are problems with high prices, bad air, bad public transport and isolation from people. Pollution is also a big problem. In cities like New York and San Francisco, the cost of living is so high that many people are forced to live in smaller homes and work from far away. Another problem is the lack of public transport in big cities. The cities are full of cars, industry and building, and the air is polluted and unhealthy. The noise from cars and construction machines affects the health of the people. Then people living in cities feel lonely despite being surrounded by many people, and this can affect their health. In order to overcome these problems, the government should encourage people to move to smaller cities. For example, countries like Australia have already started policies to spread people and revive smaller towns. Regional towns often offer a slower pace of life, a stronger sense of community and lower living costs. People who move to the region will help solve the problems of overpopulation, high costs and pollution, and their well-being will be improved.
645;People often think about creating an ideal society, but most of the times fail in making this happen.What is your opinion about an ideal societyHow can we create an ideal society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"One of the ambition of the people is to create a harmonious community to live in. Unfortunately, individuals often fail to create one. This essay will discuss what is an ideal society, as well as ways on how to make it happen.An ideal community is a place where peace of mind over shadows fear. We all now that everyone wants a place that is criminal free. For example, people can just walk in an aisle without thinking of being raped or kidnapped. Moreover, it is a community in which discrimination, prejudice and racism is prohibited. In short, everyone is treated equally regardless of gender, colors, religions, social status, jobs and looks. It also means that, people can just walk in and out of a hospital or establishments without being looked down or degraded by other people especially those with high status.However, it is difficult for people to meet this kind of standards. This mainly because nobody is made perfect and as a human being we are mostly dominated by hatred, jealousy and selfishness. Although people fail to have a perfect society, there are some ways on how to have a near perfect place to live. First of all, government should make the lives of the people a better one by being an active role model to the citizens. There should not be corruption involve amongst the higher ups. Also, as what the saying goes ""learning should start at home"", it means that, parents should the take the initiative to educate their children proper manners in dealing with other people. In Japan, children were taught in a very young age on how to treat other people. That is why they always bow down their head as a sign of respect.To conclude, creating an essential environment can be challenging and demanding for all of us. Eventhough, it is impossible to make, each one of us can has the capacity to contribute to make society an almost perfect one."; An ideal society is one in which justice, equality, peace, and a good quality of life are given to all members. However, such a society has remained an unattainable goal because of human nature, social and economic structures, and the emergence of various groups with different values and systems. An ideal society can be seen in countries such as Scandinavia with their well-developed welfare state, a very high degree of social solidarity, and low levels of corruption. In my opinion, an ideal society is one that provides education, health care, and employment to everyone, regardless of their origin. In this society, diversity is appreciated and the rights of individuals are respected. To create an ideal society, there should be many aspects, but the most important thing is education. An ideal society should invest in education and public services, and this will make people more satisfied with their lives. Moreover, citizens must be informed about social issues and encouraged to engage in public life. Inclusiveness and equality in public policy should be prioritised. The Scandinavian countries have shown how well-planned taxation and welfare systems can create a more equal society. Also, a society should have a spirit of tolerance and mutual understanding. However, it is difficult to create an ideal society, but by creating a foundation of education, inclusive policy and openness to citizens, we can at least increase social well-being and move towards an ideal society. It is essential that citizens are involved in local and national issues and that we promote dialogue between different groups.
1326;People should follow the local customs and traditions, when they come to live in a new country. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The globalised world these days makes it simpler than ever before for people to relocate and start building a life in a new country. As everyone comes from their own cultural background, a question arises of whether or not people should be expected to follow the customs of their host country. I completely agree with the view that while learning about the local customs may require some time and effort, it is valuable and will aid the integration of the newcomers into society.In many cultures following the local customs means showing respect, which is an important moral value in nearly every culture. The opposite is also true: disregarding traditions is often seen as a sign of disrespect. In order to establish good neighbourly relationships and feel welcome in the new place, it is important to demonstrate the effort to become part of the community. By expressing an interest in learning traditions, new arrivals gain a chance to interact with their neighbours and colleagues, get to know them and build some connections in the new country.Another positive aspect is the enhanced feeling of belonging that people get from participating in activities others around them are doing. When a national festival is in full swing, standing on the sidelines might make people feel excluded and perhaps even homesick, whereas joining others opens up opportunities to attend special events together, go to parties, meet new people and feel part of the celebrations. In Australia, for example, Easter is a very special time of the year and some of the traditional activities include Easter egg decoration and gifting, and baking hot cross buns; sharing your designs and recipes with others is an excellent conversation starter.In conclusion, learning the customs and traditions of one’s new country doesn’t mean a loss of their own culture. On the contrary, it is an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of cultural connections and should be embraced as a positive experience."; With regard to this, I think it is absolutely correct to follow the local customs and traditions. By following the local customs and traditions, the expatriates enrich their life and they can be better accepted by the locals. To be able to get along in everyday life, you must understand the language, festivals and etiquette. Through these efforts, a lasting friendship can be established, which is otherwise difficult to find. In addition, it is easier to move in the social world and in the working world, because it can be very helpful to understand the social rules and the legal system of the country. Misunderstandings due to cultural differences can often lead to misunderstandings and thus isolation and disaffection, and so it is very useful to know the local customs. On the other hand, the cosmopolitans themselves should be able to celebrate their own traditions, while they must also be involved in the customs of the country they have come to. This would give a richer and more diverse culture to the new country. And by celebrating the various cultures, one would then create a more cohesive community. So the conclusion is that people should strive to embrace the local customs and traditions, but it is equally important that they maintain their own.
1370;People should not work beyond the retirement age (agree/disagree);Some believe that people should not continue to work once they reach the age of retirement. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your experience.In recent years, with the improvement in healthcare sector and better , people are able to live longer and contribute to the economic progress of a nation more, compared to the past. Some see this as an entirely positive development, while others point out the drawbacks of working beyond the retirement age.Delaying retirement enables individuals to actively contribute to the society. On a personal level, working past retirement age provides an avenue for individuals to remain not only physically but also mentally active. Moreover, this option empowers the ageing population to be financially independent and economically self-sustainable past retirement age. In countries with growing ageing population such as Singapore, for instance, citizens are given an option to work beyond their retirement age based on the demands of their job and their capability to handle these tasks. Hence, working beyond retirement age empowers workers, ensures economic progression of the nation, and alleviates the challenges faced by an ageing population.On the flip side, working beyond the retirement age may result in adverse health impacts on workers and a decrease in productivity levels. In Japan, the suicide rates have recently been increasing due to rising stress levels at work faced by the ageing population who are pushed to work beyond their optimal capacity. Escalating stress levels from work to various health complications putting a strain on the healthcare system. Hence, working beyond retirement age may worsen the overall welfare of individuals and adversely impact the economy.To sum up, though working beyond retirement age health hazards leading to reduction in productivity levels, it seems to me that the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion, by assessing the capability of individuals and tailoring their jobs to their health profile, firms and companies should actively involve their workers to be productive beyond their retirement age.This essay is an excellent example of IELTS Band 8 writing. The author presents sound arguments making his/her point of view very clear, examples are being used to support the writer’s points and the organisation of information is handled very well. There are some minor inaccuracies, however, they wouldn’t affect the score much in the real test. Well done!; What is the best solution for this? Answer: For the first time, retirement is not just the end of the working life, but also a period of life devoted to rest, personal interests and family. Although some people advocate that people should work after retirement, I do not think people should be pressed to work after retirement. Working after retirement reduces the opportunity for people to fully enjoy this period. After years of hard work, people deserve to have free time, to take up hobbies, to travel, to learn and to learn. Work after retirement can lead to overwork and even illness, and the benefits of working after retirement cannot be ignored. Secondly, working after retirement has a negative impact on people's health. People in their seventies and eighties have many health problems, and their full-time work may not be feasible. In addition, there is the mental and physical burden of work. Working after retirement also has an impact on the economy. If the older generation continues to work, the number of jobs for the younger generation will be greatly reduced, and the quality of life of the older generation will be greatly reduced. It is not impossible to create a career. In conclusion, although the decision to work after retirement is personal, society must adhere to the idea that retirement is a period of rest and rejuvenation. If the elderly retire and make room for the younger generation, not only will the diversification of the workforce be achieved, but also the knowledge that the old man has accumulated will be passed on to the young. The younger generation is vigorously developing the economy.
709;People think that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. Others believe that there are other alternative solutions for reducing crime.Discuss both views and give your opinion on this topic.;"Nowadays the sentences that judges give to criminals is always at the centre of attention of the society; some people think that the best way to reduce the amount of crime cases is to give longer prison sentences, while, others say that there are other alternative ways to stop it. This essay will talk about both views and, at the end, I will give my opinion about the argument.It is always more common to see long sentences for criminals, also if their crimes are not too bad to deserve that type of punishment; the reason why the court gives to them long sentences is because they think that staying a lot in prison will make the criminals understand that what they did is wrong and, next time, they will think twice before doing something bad or against the law.However long sentences can go against the human rights because they will take away from prisoners years of their life; for this reason, some people think that it can be better if, instead of stay close in a jail without doing nothing, they can be used in various works that will make them useful for the society and better person at the end of the sentence, like cleaning the city, helping old people in retirement homes and also cook for poor people.I think that there are other ways to stop crime instead of giving long punishments, also because everyone should have a second chance in their life and, more importantly, teach and show to prisoners different aspects of the community will help cities to become better places with less crimes to stop.This essay talked about two different types of views about crime sentences in our society, with my own opinion about the argument in the last part of it."; The supporters of the idea of longer prison sentences think that they are a deterrent and a strong way to prevent crime. Both arguments have their advantages and disadvantages. The supporters of longer prison sentences often cite statistics that crime has fallen in countries where stricter sentencing laws are enforced. It is believed that the fear of a significant punishment can deter people from crime. On the other hand, by keeping dangerous people away from society for a longer time, the risk of committing another crime is reduced. A great number of criminals come from poor backgrounds, where there is often a lack of education and other problems. So it is better to invest in such things as education, work training and the care of mental health. The opposite view is that a longer prison sentence does not eliminate the causes of crime. Longer sentences may be necessary for serious crimes, but alternative solutions to the causes of crime are needed. In my opinion, it is best to take a balanced view, so that in the long run rehabilitation rather than just punishment will lead to integration into society, a lower recidivism rate and ultimately a more profound social impact. In conclusion, a longer sentence may serve as a deterrent, but a more comprehensive policy that combines both punishment and rehabilitation will probably lead to a more lasting reduction in crime. By providing support and rehabilitation, society creates an environment where convicted individuals can successfully reintegrate and break the cycle of crime.
1286;People today find their lives more and more dominated by their jobs. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is certainly true that many people around the world find their lives dominated by the work that they have to do. This is shown when you realise how people’s work, and how much time, effort and resources they devote to it, is often the subject of conversation.Most people depend on their jobs to generate an income to pay for their lives’ necessities and luxuries, and so work can naturally become a dominating focus. As this is an important part of nearly everyone’s everyday life, it can seem that people’s lives are indeed becoming more influenced by their jobs. Whether this emphasis on work is more significant now than in previous years is debatable. In many developed countries around the world, there are procedures in place to help people with finding work, providing unemployment benefits, ensuring education, and offering pension payments. In times past, these provisions were not in place and a job or business was required to provide the necessary income.Therefore, in spite of increases in the cost of living in many places around the world, it can be argued there is actually less pressure than in previous years to keep one’s job and perform well at it. This, in turn, would lead to people’s lives being less influenced by their jobs today. It is also true that in the past, people were as responsible and focused on doing well in their responsibilities as today and so, in this respect, the people of the past would be equally dedicated to their work as people are today.While I agree that people’s lives today are often dominated by their jobs, I feel that the current situation is not necessarily worse than before. In fact, it may be more positive, due to the fewer pressures to earn money in many countries.;" In my opinion, I agree that people's lives are increasingly dominated by work, a tendency driven by technological developments, cultural expectations and economic pressures. Firstly, the development of technology has blurred the line between our private and professional lives. Secondly, the ever-increasing presence of work has changed the way people experience and order their lives. In a survey carried out by Gallup in 2022, more than half of American employees said they were ""always on"", which increases the risk of burnout and stress. Thirdly, with the spread of smart phones and remote working, employees are now accessible at all times, thereby creating an ever-present feeling of obligation and reducing personal time. Fourthly, cultural expectations can play a role in the situation. In many societies, people's self-worth is often measured by their career success, and in this constant pursuit of success, employees can feel forced to put their careers above personal relationships and self-care. Fifthly, economic factors must not be forgotten, as the rising cost of living means that employees are increasingly forced to work longer hours or take on extra jobs to survive. For example, in highly competitive industries such as finance and technology, working long hours is often viewed as a badge of honour, and employees can feel forced to conform to these demanding expectations, thereby sacrificing their health and well-being. Lastly, although work is an essential part of life, many people's lives today are heavily influenced, if not dominated, by their work, resulting from a combination of technology, cultural expectations and economic realities. This financial pressure not only reduces personal time, but also increases the feeling of stress and dissatisfaction with work. So in order to make work an enhancement rather than a hindrance to life, both employees and companies must strive for a better balance."
1264;Percentage of UK people who consumed daily recommended amount of fruit and vegetable in 2002, 2006 and 2010.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar graph compares the proportion of UK citizens in terms of their consumption of daily recommended portions of fruits and vegetables in three different years which are 2002, 2006, and 2010.Overall, females consumed the highest percentage of their recommended healthy food, followed by males, and last are the children.additionally the year 2006 had witnessed the vastest consumption of vegetables and fruits among all given years.Women ate exactly 25% of the daily adviced dose of natural food in the year 2002, 32% in 2006, and 26% in 2010, however men took 22% of the recommended dose in the year 2002, 26% in 2006, and 24% in 2010.On the other hand younger individuals only consumed 11%, 18%, and 16% of the daily requirements of veggies and fruits in the years 2002, 2006, and 2010 respectively. It appears that residents of the UK had eaten the highest daily requirements of greens and fruits in the year 2006 as compared to the years 2006 and 2010.; The following information shows the percentage of the UK population that met the five daily recommended portions of fruit and vegetables. In 2002, only 24% of the population of the UK met the five recommended portions, revealing a considerable nutritional deficit among the population. The consumption of fruit and vegetables is a key indicator of the nutritional health of a population and is frequently monitored to evaluate nutritional standards. It is likely that this increase is due to public health initiatives and government initiatives aimed at promoting a healthy, balanced diet, and an awareness of the importance of fruit and vegetables. However, in 2006 the percentage had risen to 29%, suggesting that public health campaigns, and government initiatives were effective in increasing the awareness of the benefits of fruit and vegetables. These increases are probably due to several factors, such as an increase in the availability of healthier food, changes in public health advice, and changes in people’s preference towards healthier food. In 2010 the percentage rose further to 33%. This increase is probably due to several factors, including changes in availability of healthier food, changes in people’s preference towards healthier food, and changes in public health awareness. Despite these increases, a substantial proportion of the population are still below the recommended five portions, highlighting the need for further public health initiatives. In conclusion, the figures for the period from 2002 to 2010 show a gradual increase in the percentage of the UK population achieving the five daily recommended portions of fruit and vegetables.
1402;Popular events like the football world cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The World Cup football and the Olympics are held worldwide with great national support and expectations. As a fan of those competitions, I agree with the idea that sporting events can be necessary for international relations and national unity, but only partially, because such events can have unintended effects on relationships between countries.First of all, the World Cup, Olympics and other international games work for easing tensions among different nations. For example, South and North Korea have football games regularly two nations a chance to understand each other . In the mid of North Korean supporters came to South Korea with the footballers and they were very excited during the sporting events. Even if it sounds ridiculous, many South Koreans were quite surprised at that moment when North Koreans shouted and cried during the match. We all realized that they were very normal sports fans even though they were occasionally very secretive. Through the sports, two divided nations could reduce their political and ideological tensions and could feel the patriotic unity.On the other hand, some sports matches can make international relations worse. For instance, football or baseball games between Korea and Japan are always big matches in two countries where . Sometimes, after the matches, the two rivals blame each other and their patriotic emotions explode in an aggressive way. scenario is that the troubles caused by losing games affect the players directly.; First, international sports events like the World Cup and the Olympic games offer a platform for nations to meet and compete against each other. While it is possible to argue that sport can also incite war, I would argue that the positive effects of such events outweigh the negative ones. In 1998, for example, the football world cup was watched with astonishment by a game between the United States and Iran, the two countries with hostile relations to each other. The athletes represent their countries and thus their culture and the athletes thereby promote the exchange of ideas and the respect of different countries. Second, international sporting events are a constructive way to show national pride. Cheering on their team makes people feel good and thus not aggressive. Thus, despite the existing political differences, international sporting events show people the common ground between peoples. People cheer together and this can unite people in a country. However, it is also undeniable that sports can lead to violence and hatred between the fans of different teams. So international sporting events can also be seen as psychological outlets for national pride, and they offer people a chance to celebrate their national identity in a peaceful and celebratory context. In conclusion, international sporting events like the football world cup play an important role in reducing international tensions and allowing patriotic feelings to be expressed in a safe way. Nevertheless, the measures taken by the organising committees to ensure safety and sportsmanship, in many cases, greatly reduce these risks.
913;Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:In the past, sporting champions used to be motivated primarily by the desire to win a match or to break world records. These days they are more likely to be motivated by prize money and the opportunity to be famous.What message does this send to young people and how does this attitude to sport affect the sports themselves?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;There were many sport competitions organized after the World-War II since the first Olympic games was held in Athena, in 1963, to bring the world together again. Previously, sport competition was seen as an opportunity for the athletes to break the world records for the pride of their home countries. However, nowadays, people are more inclined to win the match because of money reward and glory. I believe that young people should be more encouraged to achieve their goals to become a champion so that the value of sport competition would not be purely for commercial purpose.In the last decades, there have been a lot of sport competitions being held from national to global level. The athletes were trained by the supported teams to do their best to become the world champion. It was the pride of such athlete to win and see their national flags were rised after the match. Over the years, sport has become more commercial following its popularity to attract global audiences. Many athletes are paying more attention for the opportunity to win the match for commercial purpose. For example, one wants to become a famous soccer player so that they could become the ambassador of Adidas and get more income out of it.Due to the temptation for getting famous and having more money, there are people who choose to play unfairly during a competition. Instead of focusing on increasing their skills, they would cheat to win the game for money. For example, a soccer player may use thyroid injection for boosting their energy level even though it is strictly prohibited. Moreover, sport is not seen anymore to promote peace and solidarity among people from different cultural backgrounds but for the chance to get the superficial gloriness.To conclude, even if the motivation has shifted, the young people should learn to focus more on becoming a real champion and play fairly so that they can become the best athletes in thier expertise while the money and glory would follow them after.; If you are being asked to discuss a development in the recent history of sport, the obvious points of discussion would be the changing motivations of sporting champions, their messages to young people and the effect that this has on the sports themselves. In the past, Michael Jordan and Serena Williams were celebrated not just for their wins, but for their dedication, hard work and excellence. They epitomized the spirit of sport and its success, and they represented the idea that success was built on passion and hard work. Today, however, the narrative has changed. With the huge sums of money and sponsorship deals on offer, young people are not just interested in winning, but in the prize money and the fame. The shift towards prize money and sponsorship can lead to the commodification of sport and to the devaluing of the sport itself. Young people see that success in sport is now measured in terms of money and fame, rather than personal growth and the importance of passion and dedication. By promoting the values of sport, such as teamwork, discipline and passion, young people can be encouraged to pursue their dreams for the right reasons, and a healthy and admirable sporting culture can be built. For example, doping scandals often stem from an athlete trying to keep or enhance their marketability, in a world where only the most visible successes are rewarded. These examples show that the reality of today’s sport needs to be balanced with the basic joys of the sport, to ensure that the success of future sporting champions is built on personal achievement, but on personal integrity as well. In conclusion, while the monetary lure of modern sport is a strong one, it is the responsibility of coaches, parents and mentors to foster a sporting culture based on values that honor the true spirit of competition.
903;Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:Some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by giving them extra money. This practice can act as an incentive for some but may also have a negative impact on others.To what extent is this style of management effective?Are there better ways of encouraging employees to work hard?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Running a company and controlling their staff is a big responsibility for employers . In general, employers should have a great vision about the future of their own company and how to improve it in a better way .To start with, some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by simply giving them more many. In addition, that practice can act as a good source of motivation, you can see that your hard work and your extra hours wasn't waste after all .On the other hand, this style of management may affect tha company and their community in a negative way . For example, the manager of the institution may be more focused on just one employee who's always have the extra credit for the work therefore the other employees work hard for nothing and that leave a bad idea that they clearly work for just having that extra money and rewards from the manager .Beside that, employees will be affected and their productivity will change and drop even more and all of that is a result on how the management of a company impact their work and their effort of doing more .To sum it up, all the members in that company worked so hard, a little credit for their effort and long hours of developing their company and rewards them for it won't do any harm . Not to mention, a manager can reward the staff of the institution by giving them a day or two off or basically a three hours break . Anything that make them really satisfied after their long and efficient work towards the developing of the company.; In this essay I will discuss the effectiveness of financial rewards as a means of managing staff and also consider alternative ways of motivating employees. In some cases financial rewards can increase productivity and improve performance. For example, employees in sales-related jobs, who are rewarded for exceeding their quotas, are more likely to work hard to achieve their goals. The money they receive as bonuses can also encourage them to increase their sales and become more productive. On the other hand, a reliance on financial rewards can lead to problems. Some companies, such as Salesforce, have reported an increase in productivity and an increase in sales when they offer financial rewards to their employees. Moreover, if employees become reliant on financial rewards, they may become less enthusiastic about their work and, if the rewards are not guaranteed, they may lose interest in it. Also, a reliance on financial rewards can cause problems in the team. For example, staff may become more interested in their own personal performance and goals than in the success of the team. To motivate employees more effectively, companies could also offer non-financial rewards, such as career development, flexible working conditions and public recognition of their achievements. These practices can create a more inclusive and sustainable motivation. In conclusion, financial rewards are effective in motivating employees but they are not without their disadvantages. However, a balance between financial and non-financial rewards is more likely to lead to an increase in productivity, greater staff satisfaction and higher profits for the company.
1308;Professional sportsmen and sportswomen and professional entertainers can often command enormous salaries today and this situation reflects society’s dependence on being entertained.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is no secret that today’s entertainment industry is extremely popular, with nearly everyone being engaged at some time in watching TV shows, movies and sports games. The North American sports industry alone generates a massive $67.7 billion every year. With the present emphasis on entertainment, sportsmen and women and professional entertainers can earn enormous salaries, with figures in the millions for one game, appearance or film. This situation certainly does reflect today’s society’s obsession with entertainment.Many people argue that celebrities do not deserve such payment when work in other professions considered of equal or higher value to society is underpaid. A-list celebrities can make over $20 million per movie, whilst many average workers can barely make ends meet. Of course there are lots of people who say that there are better ways the money could be used, rather than allowing such a vast amount to go to just one person. This is a fairly naive point of view, though. So long as people wish to watch entertainment, advertising in turn will be present and the most watched celebrities will be able to earn high salaries, as their presence will ensure the high viewing figures the advertisers desire.Though celebrities and sportsmen and sportswomen often make very large sums of money, it can also be seen as unfair to say that they do not deserve it or propose their money be used for something else. While it is true that they did not find a cure for cancer or made a life-changing scientific discovery, their hard work and expertise created a product that the public wants to see and the high payment merely reflects their value.In conclusion, it is clear that today’s society is indeed a society obsessed with being entertained and the high salaries paid to those who entertain society clearly reflect this. The high payments, however, are not necessarily out of place or undeserved.; The essay must be in English. Firstly, the huge numbers of fans and spectators that both sports and entertainment can attract indicate how important they are in our daily lives. Secondly, the high salaries that both sportsmen and sportswomen and entertainers command in today’s society clearly indicate that we depend on them for entertainment. In this way, sports stars like Lionel Messi and LeBron James not only display their tremendous talent but also play an important part in the economic engine that benefits both the national and the world economy. Major sporting events like the Super Bowl or the FIFA World Cup draw millions of spectators worldwide, bringing in billions of dollars in sponsorship, advertising and other revenue. With this kind of financial background it is only natural that sports stars and entertainers get their fair share of the profits they help to create. And we, the consumers, willingly spend large sums on tickets, souvenirs and streaming subscriptions, which further increases the salaries of those who provide the entertainment. Thirdly, our society has come to depend on the people who provide entertainment and provide a means of escape from everyday life. In a society that increasingly appreciates work-life balance, people are more and more likely to take part in sports or entertainment to relax and have fun. But in this sense, there is a clear question about what society values most and how it ranks the importance of sports and entertainment compared to other essential services. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that there is a big difference in the salaries of different professions. For example, teachers and health care workers often get comparatively small salaries, despite their important role in society. While there is no denying that sports and entertainment play an important role in economic growth, it also highlights the need for a wider discussion about our values and how we rank different professions. In conclusion, the high salaries that professional sportsmen and entertainers can command show that our society is dependent on being entertained.
1311;Providing a national system in a country where the unemployed receive a regular payment only encourages people not to seek work and puts an unreasonable strain on a country’s financial resources.Discuss this statement and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;In modern day society, money is a driving force for nearly everyone. Most people aspire to be financially secure and to have the ability to live the life they want. However, not everyone is able to find paid employment, and for that reason in some countries around the world, governments have initiated a system where the unemployed receive a regular payment to enable them to survive. Some people believe it is an excellent idea, whilst others believe that it is exhausting a country’s financial resources.When looking at the positive aspects of this system, it can be said that it prevents individuals from having a private bankruptcy. When somebody becomes unemployed, he or she will have on-going costs such as rent for a dwelling, bills for water, telephone and electricity as well as the cost of food and several other things. Without a salary, this person will fall into debt, because they will be unable to cover these expenses. A national unemployment payment system will therefore prevent this person from losing nearly everything over time. Without such system, many people would become homeless and would potentially engage in criminal activities to survive. Therefore, one can say that this system is positive. Although stories are heard of people exploiting the system, usually the newly unemployed want to find a job fast in order to become financially independent again, meaning that the government does not have to support them for long.Although there are positive aspects of this system, one can also say that if the payment made by the government is too high, it will prevent people from looking for work actively. Occasionally, the payment people receive is higher than their potential salaries, deterring them from working and creating an on-going cost for the government. A potential solution for this could be providing free training and employment support to open up new career opportunities with higher income, which would motivate this group to re-enter the workforce.In conclusion, the unemployment benefits system has positive and negative aspects. Personally, I believe that the positive effects of the system outweigh the negative. The payment must remain on a level that helps people survive without regular salaries, but does not seem attractive to exploit over a longer period of time.;" Critics of unemployment benefits often claim that regular payments make people dependent on the state. A regular payment system for the unemployed has long been a subject of discussion and is still controversial today. Supporters argue that it offers support to those who have lost their jobs, while critics argue that it hinders job-seeking and financially undermines the state. For example, if people receive regular unemployment benefits and they can satisfy their basic needs, they may feel less of a need to seek employment. This phenomenon, which has been called the ""welfare trap,"" could lead to a decrease in the labor force, which could slow economic growth and innovation. Unemployment-hit countries could be in dire financial straits, and they would either have to raise taxes or reduce spending on other government programs. In addition, financing unemployment insurance may lead to government budget deficits, which could lead to a decrease in government spending on other services. This criticism must be counterbalanced with examples of successful unemployment insurance that offer support without discouraging work. For example, government programs that combine unemployment benefits with vocational training and job placement, as they do in Scandinavia, have shown that unemployment insurance can be combined with work. In the economic crisis in Greece, for example, the extensive unemployment benefits contributed to the budget deficit, which ultimately led to austerity measures that affected the entire population. In conclusion, the possibility that unemployment benefits may discourage work and increase the financial burden of the government is valid, but the important thing is the way these systems are implemented."
1314;Public health is becoming an urgent issue nowadays. Some argue that governments should create nutrition and food choice laws to improve public health, while others believe that it is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Public health has become an increasingly pressing issue in the modern world, with many populations facing rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related diseases. This has led to a debate as to whether governments should establish nutrition and food choice laws for the betterment of public health or if it solely falls on individuals to make wise choices. In my view, everyone should take ownership of their diet and assume responsibility for their health because it is the right choice.The argument for government-imposed nutrition and food choice laws is that they could help prevent people from making unhealthy choices which could lead to more serious illnesses down the line. For example, government regulations could limit the amount of sugar or fats allowed in food products, especially those marketed to children, and impose taxes on unhealthy snacks like chips and candy bars. This approach would also benefit those who lack the knowledge about healthy food, necessary to make informed decisions. By providing clear guidelines on what foods are healthy, and by taxing the unhealthy options higher, the government would steer individuals away from unhealthy options.However, there are also some valid arguments against governmental intervention. These types of regulations infringe upon individuals’ right to choose what they put in their bodies. After all, everyone should be free to make lifestyle choices for themselves. Additionally, there may not be enough evidence to suggest that overly restrictive regulations would have beneficial effects on public health outcomes in the long run. Since people’s love of unhealthy food is often considered an addiction, it is unlikely that a higher price or other warnings would be enough to deter individuals from purchasing unhealthy food items.In conclusion, while there can certainly be benefits associated with implementing nutrition and food choice laws at a governmental level, ultimately it should still come down to personal choice and responsibility as far as one’s diet is concerned. Governments should instead focus on providing citizens with better nutrition education, so that they can make better informed decisions about what they consume. This way, they can receive the information they need while still having autonomy over their own diets and lifestyles.; Public health is an urgent issue for today's society, mainly because of the growing number of lifestyle-related diseases, obesity and chronic diseases, which are endangering public health. Government advocates argue that public health is a collective issue that requires a coordinated response. Consequently, they advocate for the introduction of laws that limit the amount of salt and sugar in processed foods, and ban the advertising of unhealthy products, especially to children. They believe that many people do not have the knowledge and information they need to make informed dietary choices and that marketing practices often promote unhealthy eating. According to this view, people are able to judge their own dietary choices and that government intervention in the matter could lead to a loss of individual freedom. On the other hand, opponents of government regulations argue that individual freedom and responsibility are the best means of ensuring good health. In their view, public health can be promoted more effectively through education and voluntary commitment than through regulation. In my opinion, while individual responsibility is necessary, the government has a crucial role in shaping public health policy. A balanced approach that combines both education and regulations could be an effective means of improving public health. In short, public health is a collective issue that requires the participation of both individuals and policymakers. The government can influence the public's awareness of the importance of a healthy diet through laws that promote a healthy environment, and by educating the public it can encourage people to make healthier choices.
267;Reporting of crimes and other kinds of violent news on television and in newspapers can have adverse consquences. This kind of information should be restricted from being shown in the media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Reporting violent crimes and other violent issues could represents a adverse consequence sometimes. Overall, it is important to enphasyded that people are geting more and more violant and we can't blame only media as a mainly factor for those behavior.This kind of questions is almost a phylosical one and we will keeping this doubt for a long time, or even never now if people are becoming more agressive because they are more expousure to this kind of news, or if we are having more report regarding to violence just because people are getting more violent.I believe that people could feel estimulated to be a criminous person when they have a minimium certain that they won't be punish.For instance, stolen and other minimius crimes had increase at california region after they anounced that stolen under tham $1000 are consider a crime anymore. So the sensation that people could do anything wrong and that is no penalty for that, estimulates the number for stolen.In other hand, when we see some hardly rules the number of crime are dipest low, as we can see at Dubai, for instance. As all penalties are really hard and strongly implemented this place is considering highest safe.I bilieve that restricting any kind of information be showen in the media doesn't solve the problem, and, in fact, bring another new problem related to limited population information. When people know what are happening, type of crimes, etc, they could be prepare to handle with those problems and prevent theirselves.; Firstly, the constant exposure to violent news can lead to insensitivity among the public. Secondly, even though it is obvious that people should be informed about the dangers and happenings in their environment, the violent news should not be broadcast without any restrictions. Thirdly, the coverage of the violent news can lead to the continuation of the vicious circle. People start believing that violence is the norm in our society, which in turn affects their mental health. The cases of violence may turn into a kind of example for the others, so that the news which is in itself insignificant can result in further crimes. The so-called copycat effect states that violent details in the media may evoke a similar desire in the vulnerable members of the public. Fourthly, even though the media play a vital role in informing the public, the violent news coverage can have detrimental consequences. For instance, the local community efforts, the social reforms and the acts of kindness are often eclipsed by the reports on crimes and violence, thus creating a rather pessimistic outlook on the world. There is a need to protect the public well-being and some restrictions may be necessary. In conclusion, responsible journalism should strike a balance between the need to be informed and the negative psychological consequences for the audience.
1;Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Poverty represents a worldwide crisis. It is the ugliest epidemic in a region, which could infect countries in the most debilitating ways. To tackle this issue, rich countries need to help those in need and give a hand when possible. I agree that there are several ways of aiding poor countries other than financial aid, like providing countries in need with engineers, workers, and soldiers who would build infrastructure. Building universities, hospitals, and roadways. By having a solid infrastructure, poor countries would be able to monetise their profits and build a stronger and more profitable economy which would help them in the long term. Once unprivilged countries find their niche, the major hurdle would be passed and would definitely pave the way for much brighter future. However, I do disagree that financial aid does not solve poverty, it does if used properly and efficiently. The most determining factor if financial aid would be the way to go, is by identifying what type of poor countries' representative are dealing with. Some countries will have a responsible leader and some will not, with that being said, implementing a strategy, to distinguish responsible leaders from others, would tailor the type of aid rich countries could use. An example, A clear report and constant observation would be applied to track the progress and how this type of aid is being monetized. In summary, types of aid varies from country to another, and tailoring the type of aid is of paramount importance to solve this problem that had huge toll on poor countries.; This is a controversial issue. The most important reason why financial aid often fails to resolve poverty is the misappropriation and corruption that sometimes accompany the aid. In this case, the money meant for the poor people is either lost to the corrupt or misused for some ineffective projects, causing the people to be more and more indifferent. In contrast, when it comes to the development of science, technology and human resources, the results can be more sustainable. In addition, the developed countries can set up a long-term and long-term trade agreement to help the poor countries enter the international market. People with the right education can compete in the labor market, get a better salary, and finally get out of poverty. Rich countries, instead of only giving short-term aid, put more effort into science, technology and trade. This will not only stimulate local economies, but also create jobs and develop entrepreneurs. If you want to solve the problem of poverty in poor countries, you need to go beyond financial support.
1381;Schools should select students by their academic abilities, agree or disagree?;Some people think that schools should select students according to their academic abilities, while others believe that it is better to have students with different abilities studying together. Discuss both views and state your own opinion.Some people contend that mixed ability classes are more beneficial for children’s development than streaming them on the basis of judgement about their academic abilities. However, from my perspective, I disagree with this contention.Admittedly, mixed ability classes provide a better environment for children’s all-round development. In such classes, children with different abilities study together and in turn they can learn from one another. From example, a student, who is good at academic study but weak in dancing or painting, can learn how to dance or paint his peers. In this sense, mixed ability classes allow students to develop their abilities in different subjects instead of only academic abilities.Despite the argument above, I believe streaming students brings more benefits to teachers and students. As for teachers, separating children with better academic abilities from others facilitates effective teaching. This practice helps teachers to control their students more conveniently and easily. Compared with mixed ability in which teacher should consider students’ differences when they are using teaching methodologies, streaming makes this situation simpler. To be more specific, students are at the same level of academic ability in a class, and in turn teachers can use the same methodologies for them all. In this way, the narrower the spread of ability in the class, the more convenient the teaching can be.On top of this, enables students to learn in an effective way. According to students’ different abilities, they are taught in different ways that are more suitable for them. In the top streams, students use more difficult materials, therefore, they can learn more. In sharp contrast, teachers can explain the material more slowly to those in bottom streams. Under this circumstance, students with different academic abilities can study effectively and efficiently.In the final analysis, mixed ability classes are beneficial for students’ versatile development, but in my opinion, segregating students based on different academic ability is better for both teachers and students.The writer presented a balanced discussion of the topic, effortlessly delivered in a form of a fluent, well-written IELTS essay. The arguments and reasoning are laid out in a coherent, logical way. A wide range of vocabulary is used in this work. There are very few spelling errors that could have been caught in an additional round of proofreading (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). Keep up the good work! Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.; I strongly agree with the idea that the selection of students should be based on academic abilities. Despite the fact that there are compelling arguments for both sides, I am firmly in favor of this idea because it promotes meritocracy. Students who are naturally attracted to academics can benefit from the presence of peers who are intellectually motivated and ready for intellectual challenges. In this way, a more motivated and engaged student population is formed, which can only lead to a higher academic level. This is also reflected in the teaching method, as resources are distributed according to the needs of the individual students. Also, it is very useful to be able to designate a certain school population according to academic ability, because the curriculum and the structure of the class can be adapted to this population and the needs of the students are better met. Nevertheless, I still find it necessary to emphasize academic ability, as this can lead to a more dynamic and productive learning environment. However, despite the importance of academic ability, it should not be the only criterion for selection. Other qualities such as creativity, leadership and emotional intelligence are also important for a well-rounded education. This can eventually lead to more success for both students and educational institutions. In conclusion, selection criteria should be based on many criteria, but academic ability should be given priority.
1337;Scientists believe that the world is in danger due to environmental changes. Some people say that personal lifestyle changes should be made to reduce the damage to environment, while others think that the government should do something to help. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Environmental problems are clearly something that is often discussed in today’s world. One part of the society claims that individuals should change their habits and lifestyle to improve the ecological situation. Others, on the other hand, believe that this issue should be solved on the governmental level. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and my perspective will be offered.It is hard to deny that human kind is responsible for the current environmental situation, and it seems impossible to achieve any noticeable result in this field without the participation of vast majority of individuals. For instance, a simple lifestyle change such as introducing the separation of household rubbish can make recycling projects more convenient and efficient. Moreover, consumers can reduce their usage of plastic items and, in turn, less plastic waste will contaminate the environment.However, many people still feel that the government has more tools to prevent environmental changes. One option that the authorities have is to discourage citizens from using personal vehicles by charging high taxes and additional fees. Moreover, politicians usually have access to resources to educate people about environmental problems and promote the most important ecological projects on all levels, ranging from special courses at schools to TV shows and websites related to this topic. Furthermore, it is a key responsibility of the government to protect the environment by spending state funds on research and modern equipment. Countries where legislation protects the ecology, for example Norway, have achieved visible results and overcame most environmental problems.In conclusion, I believe that a combined approach will work best to prevent or reverse environmental changes. A contribution of every individual is just as important as the intervention from the government in order to fix existing issues and save our planet for future generations.; As a matter of fact, it is widely believed that personal changes can, to a great extent, have a beneficial effect on the environment. Simple changes like reducing waste, buying more sustainable products and adopting a vegetarian diet can substantially reduce one's carbon footprint. A person's inclination to support local businesses and to engage in community projects can have a ripple effect that will encourage others to do the same. On the other hand, many argue that the responsibility of solving environmental problems lies primarily with the government. It is widely acknowledged that a complex issue like climate change or pollution needs a systemic approach which can only be achieved through government-led initiatives. Such initiatives as laws, regulations and policies have the potential to bring about a much more systemic change than an individual could. The efforts of a single person can bring about an awareness of the issues and encourage others to be more responsible, while government policies can bring about structural changes which can reshape our economies and societies. I believe that a combination of both personal changes and government initiatives is required to effectively combat our environment issues. The combination of both will enable a multifaceted approach that can successfully address the complex issue of climate change. Only a combination of both will help us to avoid a lasting damage to the environment and to protect our planet for future generations.
1373;Senior managers should have higher salaries than other employees (agree/disagree);In many countries senior positions have higher salaries compared to those of young workers of the same company. Some people think this isn’t justified. Do you agree or disagree?While some believe that rewarding those in managerial positions with higher pay packets is appropriate, not everyone agrees with this view. Personally, I am leaning towards the latter position due to negative impacts caused by significant difference in salaries within a company.For one, executive officers should know that higher than sufficient salaries are not necessary. Indeed, the higher the remuneration they receive, the more likely the company to suffer from devoid of financial capability. Furthermore, they often gain powers that money can’t buy. For instance, they often make important decisions over how to make their company thrive. They are also entitled to allocate company’s budget and designate tasks to other workers. these non-financial entitlements, they should refrain from earning more than reasonable amounts as salaries.Unreasonably high salaries granted to the executives can also afflict other employees. In fact, it is foreseeable that many employees would feel powerless or even when they find out about the huge salary gap between the executive officers’ and theirs. Accordingly, some may leave the company, and others may go on to strike and demand a pay increase. However, those actions . Therefore, unfair salary systems like this would yield unhealthy working environment for both employers and employees.In conclusion, I oppose to those in managerial roles with obscene amounts of compensation because it can cost the company its prosperity and discourage other employees . Thus it is recommended for the company to decide on the salaries of executive officers and general workers by adopting a more motivating salary system.This is a good example of an IELTS Band 8 essay. The task statement is sufficiently discussed, and the writer’s arguments are relevant and well developed. There are only 2 body paragraphs, but they are coherent and help to organise the information. Linking words are used appropriately to sequence ideas. Skillful use of synonyms throughout the essay demonstrates the writer’s vocabulary. Some of the expressions used aren’t entirely suitable or accurate, but there aren’t many of them. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.0.; This question can be considered from many points of view, and the question is whether senior managers should have higher salaries than other employees. Firstly, senior managers have a very important role in the direction and success of the company. Secondly, senior managers have special skills that are in line with the success of the company. Thirdly, they often have to manage a large team, manage a budget and manage relations with shareholders, and this requires a lot of skill and leadership. Their decisions affect the whole company and affect its future success, and therefore their salaries should be higher, because the responsibility is also greater. Fourthly, in addition to experience, special education and a lot of experience, it is necessary to have high intellectual and emotional abilities. Fifthly, special skills are needed for a senior manager's position, which require special skills and higher intelligence, which are not often found in other employees. Finally, the salary of a senior manager can positively affect the performance of the company, because if the salary is higher, it motivates other employees to strive for this position and thus contributes to the further development of the company. Therefore, senior managers should be well paid, because they are more motivated to perform better, which in turn benefits the whole company. Management is the foundation for the success of the company, and leadership inspires the team and motivates employees. Senior managers therefore deserve a salary that is commensurate with their key role in the company. The question of income inequality is important, but senior managers have special skills that are not often found in other employees.
1357;Should employers pay more attention to personal qualities rather than qualifications?;"While recruiting a new employee, the employer should pay more attention to their personal qualities, rather than qualifications and experience. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and include relevant examples.Recent decades have witnessed a burgeoning growth of numerous industries; therefore, recruiting the right person for the position is crucial to the development of enterprises. But how do we determine if a person is the best fit? Advocates of conventional recruitment methods opine that this candidate must have sufficient experience and qualifications needed for that job. Nevertheless, some people argue that candidates’ personal qualities cannot be ignored. In my view, both components are of equal importance.To begin with, the conventional approach of checking potential workers’ qualifications via their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, issued qualifications and certifications from authorised organisations is vital. Apparently, whenever we submit a job application, we are always required to attach a CV while a cover letter is optional. Without a decent qualification, even if that candidate’s personal characteristics are suitable, the enterprise will need to carry out lots of skill trainings eventually.On the other hand, occasionally during an interview some HR officers ignore the significance of assessing how candidates’ individual qualities can fit in the company. Employers should assess not only candidates’ qualifications but also their enabling skills, ethics and value propositions. The more an employee’s personal qualities fit in a company’s culture and values, the more he or she is motivated to contribute to that company’s vision. KPMG is a great example of evaluating candidates’ personal qualifications and skills by utilising a game-based assessment process, followed by a video interview. This methodology enables a comprehensive assessment, and is embraced by many companies nowadays.To summarise, employers should assess both personal characteristics and formal qualifications when recruiting people as each of these elements has its own vital contribution to make in talent-seeking enterprises.This response covers the topic well. The writer’s position is clearly expressed and supported by an example, the use of paragraphing makes this essay organised and easy to follow. Linking words are used appropriately. The use of complex sentences and advanced vocabulary is impressive. Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS."; Because of the complexities of today's work environment, the argument that employers should place greater emphasis on personal qualities rather than qualifications is becoming more and more relevant. Although qualifications, such as diplomas and licenses, show a candidate's knowledge and skills in a particular field, personal qualities, such as emotional intelligence, flexibility, teamwork, and communication skills, can play a much more important role in a long-term success of the company. In addition, personal qualities are closely related to an employee's ability to learn and develop in a particular position. For example, a candidate with strong social skills can improve teamwork and create a productive and dynamic environment that is vital for innovation and productivity. Such qualities also allow employees to take initiative, develop projects, and promote company culture. In a rapidly changing labor market, the ability to adapt to new methods and technology is a key competency for all employees. This is where candidates with a strong work ethic and an openness to change may prove to be more useful than those with a certain degree. Rather than seeing personal qualities and qualifications as mutually exclusive, companies should consider them as complementary. However, it is important to find the right balance between the two. In the end, the establishment of a qualified and talented workforce is the key to success in a highly competitive environment.
1385;Should people spend a lot on weddings and birthday parties?;"Some people think that spending a lot on holding wedding parties, birthday parties and other celebrations is just a waste of money. Others, however, think that these are necessary for individuals and the society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Throwing parties can be expensive. While some people do not find these fancy gatherings worth what they cost, others believe such events are important to both individuals and the society.People choose to throw parties for a number of reasons. For starters, they can make better teams. Project kick-off parties are good opportunities to break the ice and help team members to know each other better. Celebrating a victory create a sense of success and belonging. Companies do not see parties as of money and allocate budget to support such events; moreover, they often leave good memories. From our own experiences, we all have happy memories of our birthday parties when we were little. Every family has great photos at family gatherings in their album. In addition, contrary to what some people believe that spending on parties is a waste of social resources, they actually create value, either by employing people in the party-planning business or by offering people better experiences.The popularity of parties, however, causes some tension in the society. They are hard on introverted people who find themselves uncomfortable in the crowd. This is a clinic symptom which psychologists call “social anxiety disorder”. There are other ways to celebrate important events that may have greater value for their cost. For instance, companies could send out gifts after successful projects and parents could take their children on family trips to celebrate birthdays.In my opinion, while a party is a form of social event that brings many benefits to individuals and the society, other choices should also be considered, either to cut spending or to relieve the stress of those who are not fond of crowded celebrations.This is a very good essay. Other than minor inaccuracies there are no problems (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). Seems to be worth IELTS Band 8.";" The question of whether people should spend a lot on weddings and birthdays is one of the most controversial topics in our time. On the one hand, weddings and birthdays are important events in life, which serve to mark important life events, establish relationships, and make memorable memories; on the other hand, excessive spending can lead to financial problems and the loss of true meaning. Creating a memorable event is important, but spending must fit within one's financial reality. Weddings, which are often considered the highest manifestation of love, are very easy to turn into an expensive affair, as it is the impression that the guests must be a lot, and the places too expensive. In the end, the essence of the wedding lies in the union of two people, not in the cost of the celebration. In the same way, birthdays, especially the landmark, can become very expensive due to the various themes, catering and entertainment. Many newlyweds enter their married life with wedding debts, which can affect their joy of marriage itself. In conclusion, weddings and birthdays are both important and worthy of celebration, but it is important to reconcile the desire for memorable and memorable events with financial considerations. While these events have an emotional value, spending too much on them can eclipse the personal relationship that should define them. Finding a meaningful way to celebrate these events without incurring unnecessary costs will allow the experience to be authentic and long-lasting. Celebrations should enrich our lives, not complicate them."
1393;Should the same laws which prohibit the sale and consumption of heroin be applied to tobacco? Discuss.;Recently, a heated debate when a few reputable health organizations suggested the application of a similar act of heroin selling and usage prohibition . In this , I will analyze why the adoption of such a law could be a breakthrough in our youngsters’ safety, according to my vision.Firstly, tobacco does not differ much from heroin when it comes to the addictive effect. , the active ingredient in tobacco, exerts its effect by acting directly on smoker’s brain cells. Numerous experiments carried out by on animals, rats, proved that this toxic chemical does lead time to dependency, similarly to the effect experienced with .Secondly, the restriction on selling would surely show an instant decline in tobacco smoking. ” Having easy access to cigarettes puts a tremendous pressure, especially on teenagers,to resist such a temptation” Dr.Hisham , head of department at Alexandria Medical college , states firmly. “Giving the new generation the sense that the severity of smoking is to other lethal drugs usage be a life saving step, they will thank us for as they get older.” he continues.To recapitulate, applying of a futuristic law such as the suggested one will have a positive impact ,not only on young people’s health but on our society as a whole.; Heroin is an illegal drug that has high addiction potential and is associated with severe health risks, including death. Heroin is a highly toxic substance that is known to be extremely harmful to one’s health, and may even lead to death by overdose. Since both substances are harmful, the arguments for and against applying the same laws to tobacco as to heroin should be considered. The principal argument in favor of applying heroin-like restrictions to tobacco relates to the issue of public health. The regulations on heroin are directed primarily at protecting the health of the public. On the other hand, tobacco is legal and is used widely despite its well-documented health hazards, which include lung cancer, heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The economic costs of tobacco are significant. Tobacco is responsible for millions of deaths annually, which are far more than are caused by heroin, and this alone would make a thorough review of the law desirable. According to this view, it is not only the sale that should be restricted, but also advertising, taxation and the criminalization of the consumption of tobacco in certain settings. If the use of heroin can be restricted for public health purposes, then consistency would dictate equally strict regulation of tobacco, which would involve not only the ban on the sale, but also the total ban on advertising, a very high tax, and even criminalization of the consumption of tobacco in certain situations. The better approach, however, would be to adopt a more moderate approach, a combination of education, regulation and support for cessation. The danger of the introduction of prohibition is that the illicit nature of tobacco could lead to an increase in the dangers, as it has with the use of heroin.
1394;Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth with poorer nations by providing them with things such as food and education? Or is this the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens?;I think that wealthy nations should be required to share their wealth with poorer nations. at providing such things as food and education because of the three following reasons.Firstly, citizens of both wealthy nations and poorer nations are human beings. Therefore, we can not look at, hear of, or talk about people who lack food, education, without compassion and sympathy. Sharing wealth with poorer nations is not only a good deed but is also a .Secondly, many nations in Africa and Asia are poor. Famine, diseases, crime and illiteracy are killing the citizens of these countries. , many nations in Europe and America are rich. If there are no actions taken, this inequality will increase dramatically. Poor countries will become poorer while rich countries will become richer. As a result, the poorest countries will become slaves of the richest countries. So, sharing wealth is useful way to prevent people from that bad future.Thirdly, although sharing wealth with poorer nations is very necessarythis help should only stop at providing such things as food, medicine and education. Or else, poor nations may become dependent on the aid. They may lose enthusiasm to build their countries by themselves. Moreover, rich nations can take advantage of sharing wealth to interfere with the governance of poor nations’. This can’t be considered a humane action and should be prevented.In my opinion, sharing wealth with poorer nations has both a bad side and a good side. What we have to do is its bad side and its good side.; On the one hand, inequality between nations is the result of historical injustices such as colonization and exploitation. On the other hand, sharing wealth with poorer nations is a serious matter, both ethically and practically. The distribution of food, education and health care can correct historical injustices and establish a more equitable international community. In this context, it is a moral duty of the rich nations to contribute to world peace and world equality. The practical consequences of this are considerable, because if people in poorer nations have more education and better nutrition, they will become more productive and more secure, and the rich nations will benefit from new markets and reduced tensions in the world due to poverty and inequality. On the other hand, it is essential to understand that the governments of poorer nations have an important role to play in ensuring the welfare of their citizens, by establishing good administration, effective resource management and good policy. But often the extent to which these can be realized depends on external support, which is why the richer nations have an important role to play. Collaboration between the richer and poorer nations is the basis of a just and equitable international society. Finally, although governments in poorer nations must do their best to ensure the well-being of their citizens, the wealthier nations also have a duty to help. The distribution of wealth by aid and aid creates not only a moral obligation, but also a more sustainable and equal world economy.
1302;Social media has become a real problem for some young people today, and governments should create laws that allow only people over 18 years of age to have accounts.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Social media today is extremely significant to a majority of the population, especially the younger generation. Many teenagers find it exceptionally convenient and necessary for communication and entertainment. However, not everyone is able to use social media responsibly, which gave rise to the idea of making it accessible to only those older than eighteen years of age.Though there are negatives, such as cyber-bullying, or being too distracted by these modern media, there are issues surrounding most things in life. It is a choice to go onto a social media website, and many younger people are capable of managing accounts without any difficulties. It is not the government’s responsibility to monitor under eighteen-year olds; that is for the parents.Statistics show that over eighty per cent of teens use a form of online social media. It allows them to chat online, easily stay in contact with friends and family across the world, and see updates on others’ lives (through text, photos or videos). Social media is a way to express thoughts or ideas and to stay in contact with the rest of the world.To not permit one of the largest Internet-using demographics to use social media because a few people have problems with it is an irrational and an unfair restriction. Not only would profit be lost with fewer users, but controlling who creates accounts and monitoring proof of age would be difficult as well. I believe that laws should not make social media inaccessible to young people under eighteen; this would be unnecessary and absurd.";" On the one hand, the dangers associated with social media are a real problem for young people. There are arguments for restricting access to social media to only people over 18, but I think this may not be a complete solution to the challenges presented by social media. The dangers include cyberbullying, sexual predators and exposure to inappropriate content. The study of mental health also points to a strong connection between the excessive use of social media and anxiety, depression and loneliness. Also, it is difficult to control the age restrictions effectively; many young people can easily lie about their age and create accounts. However, the use of age restrictions is an oversimplification of a complex issue. Social media also have positive aspects such as creativity, social contact and self-expression. Rather than creating age restrictions, it is possible to increase digital literacy and parental involvement. Schools can provide education about how to use social media in a responsible way, which gives children the skills to navigate the digital world safely. This raises questions about the implementation and consequences of such laws. Instead, I think it would be better to focus on education and communication about social media use. It can lead to a better and safer use of social media. Parents can also be involved in the conversation to ensure that children use social media in a safe and healthy way."
771;Society is based on rules and laws. If individuals were free to do whatever they want to do, it could not function. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?;It is commonly held that society can operate perfectly by a set of rules. It means that providing total freedom to people undoubtedly results in chaos with the further possibility of total collapse. I strongly agree with this point of view as I am in the opinion that rules play a significant role in creating a stable society. In this essay, this idea will be discussed in detail.Basically, a set of rules can be helpful to achieve productive results in such essential areas as medicine and construction. For example, it is necessary to develop common procedures of operations in surgery or traffic rules for public transport. Unless there are not standardized, it might cause a lot of deaths or at least injuries. Constructing also should be based on common processes because comfort and safe accommodation is a necessity for many people. Although there are people who consider rules and laws limiting and imposing, it can be argued that they are critical in the organization of humanity.Laws are not obstacles on the way to people's freedom because they are established to regulate formal relationships when it is difficult to find a compromise informally. Moreover, they are vitally important when people face crime and violence. Without any system of justice solving crimes becomes more challenging. All criminal accidents tend to be out of control and spread around the world immediately. Shoplifting, robbery, and even disastrous wars can plunge our world into darkness. This way humanity might face total chaos where morals values and behavioral patterns are neglected. In this context, the word ‘society’ risks becoming totally meaningless, as its main definition is a 'group of people with common traditions and rules.'From the arguments presented above, one may conclude that any society needs standards, laws, or even moral principles. They form a foundation for safety, a good level of medicine, and science that allows to create a strong society and manage any difficulties or threats that may disturb people’s well-being.; A society without rules would quickly fall into chaos, as people would do what they wanted, often at the expense of others. The need for a system is demonstrated by the functions of society, such as maintaining peace, protecting rights, ensuring justice. If everyone did what they wanted, society would be unable to function, and the essential agreements that prevent the chaos of anarchy would break down. At the same time, laws serve as guidelines for human behavior, ensuring that individual freedom does not violate the freedom of others. The laws against theft and violence, for example, are extremely important for the life of each citizen, because they create an environment where one can go about one's daily business without fear. In many societies, the laws against discrimination protect the dignity of each person and thus illustrate that the rules not only impose legal but also moral and social responsibilities. At the same time, a system plays an important role in establishing social norms and values, because they set boundaries that determine not only legal behavior, but also ethical and moral behavior and social responsibility. So, while I consider the necessity of the system, it is also necessary to advocate for the reformation and evolution of the system in line with the needs of society. On the other hand, it is important to realize that not all rules are just, and the rigidity of the rules can suppress individual creativity and freedom. That's why there has to be a balance and the system must be constantly developed in order to ensure justice and fairness. The complete absence of the system would presumably lead to chaos, but it is necessary to constantly discuss the nature of the system to ensure that it serves all citizens equally.
1352;Some believe the government should take care of retirees, while others think everyone should save for their own retirement (opinion);Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.It is true that when people advance into their golden years, they require more help and attention. For that reason, a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly. However, I tend to agree with those who argue that workers should be saving a portion of their income to have a nest egg in their retirement.To begin with, a culture of saving rather than depending on the government may foster the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government. As a result, the government would be able to release more funds to more productive purposes, such as development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which may expedite the overall progression of a country.In addition to economic factors, putting money aside has some personal benefits. Since savings-oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses, this may instill a sense of self-respect and pride in them. On the other hand, those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma, as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society. Hence, to live a life with dignity and pride, taking responsibility for funding one’s own retirement is evidently a better option from individual perspective.In contrast, the provision of monetary outlays for retirees has proven unfeasible in many countries. Since in many nations the number of senior citizens is on the rise, in the long run governments are likely to struggle to sustain the cost of providing for the elderly. The early signs of this have been seen in many countries that were forced to raise the retirement age, including my home country where men can now retire at the age of 67 instead of 65. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, these kinds of support may become completely unsustainable.In conclusion, the provision of state monetary support may undoubtedly lessen the concern of retirees to some extent. However, considering the issue of sustainability of this provision, it is better to opt for individual savings from the very beginning of working life, for the benefit of both individual and national development.This response addresses all parts of the topic, by discussing the merits of funding one’s own retirement versus relying on government pension. The writer’s opinion has been stated as well and is very clear. The neat presentation of ideas has been helped by appropriate paragraphing, and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay. The author’s vocabulary seems to be rich and there is a variety of sentence structures used in this essay. Overall, this essay deserves an IELTS Band 8.; . Both opinions have their advantages and disadvantages. However, I believe that the combination of both is the best solution to ensure the security of the pension for all. As a government program, social security, the pension is of great significance for the well-being of the elderly and for the prevention of poverty. Not everyone has the knowledge, opportunities and income stability to effectively save for their retirement. The economic differences and unexpected life events, such as unemployment and illness, can seriously disrupt the retirement plan, which makes it easy for the elderly to become vulnerable. Therefore, the belief that people should save for their own retirement mainly focuses on the importance of self-discipline and financial independence, and advocates that individuals should make decisions about their own finances, thereby promoting their own independence and reducing government dependence. In my opinion, the best way to ensure the security of the pension is to combine individual efforts and government support. By encouraging the accumulation of capital and protecting those in need, we can make pensions more sustainable, fair and efficient, and ensure that all retired people can live a dignified life. . The result is not only a more favorable policy for individuals, but also a more efficient and effective approach to promoting social equality.
1398;Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree that this is the right course of action? Give reasons for your opinion.;, organization and companies as well as governments impose restrictions in work places and public amenities. It has become fashionable in the world today . I feel that smoking can be harmful, but I don’t think it should be forbidden completely. I would also argue that people should have the whether or not they should smoke.Allow me to present the three positive sides of smoking. Firstly, smoking certainly helps many people to relax. For some, it even improves concentration. If someone is upset or they have , to smoke to reduce the pressure or tension. people like to smoke when they are relaxing with friends. Secondly, governments throughout the world make huge profits from taxes on cigarettes. The income obtained through taxes provides funds which are used for building and public places such as parks, gardens, sports ground and foot paths. Thirdly, tobacco industry also employs tens of thousands of people all over the world, particularly in poorer countries such as Zimbabwe or the Philippines. Without cigarettes, these people would have no jobs.Despite these positive are lots of negative effects to smoking too. Initially, smoking has been proven to be very dangerous for health. cigarette contains more than 4000 chemical substances, therefore, it dangerous diseases such as heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis or lung cancer. According to a recent report in Britain close to 3,500 people are killed each year in road accidents and 120,000 are killed by smoking. Furthermore, smoking costs governments millions of dollars because of the large number of people who need treatment in hospitals for smoking-related problems. Moreover, passive smoking is also a major concern today. Recent research shows that non-smokers can suffer from health problems if they spend long periods of time among people who do smoke. In the UK children whose parents are are three times as likely to start smoking themselves .In short, I think the world would be a better place without cigarettes. However, the decision of whether smoke or not to smoke should be for each individual to make. I suggest that people should not smoke in a room or a place where there are non smokers, however they should be free to smoke elsewhere.; The first and most important reason is the health of smoking. The idea of prohibiting smoking in offices and public places has become a subject of great controversy in recent years. I myself agree with the prohibition of smoking in these places, because it is clearly beneficial for public health and also makes a better atmosphere. It has been proven that smoking can cause serious diseases in non-smokers, including heart disease and lung cancer. According to the World Health Organization, smoking causes more than 8 million deaths every year. Therefore, by prohibiting smoking in offices and public places, we can save both smokers and non-smokers from the dangers of second-hand smoke. Also, prohibiting smoking in public places makes it more comfortable for people to be in the public places, without the discomfort of smoke and the smell of tobacco. So it is a big step in the health of people. Also, by prohibiting smoking in public places, we can reduce the acceptance of unhealthy behavior in the country. Many companies have found that they have increased customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction. In addition, it is a step to reduce the acceptance of smoking, especially among young people. In conclusion, the prohibition of smoking in offices and public places is a necessary and beneficial action. Smoke-free environments encourage people to think about their smoking habits and, perhaps, to stop smoking. People also feel that public health is more important than the comfort of the public, and a better and healthier community will be built for everyone.
665;Some cities create housing areas by providing taller buildings. Others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. What solution is better?;Some big cities, especially in Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama in Japan tend to build taller buildings like skyscrapers. Other local cities and places where are scarcely populated are built wider. This is quite understandable in terms of space, and there might be some solutions to dissipate populations around Japan.Initially, the main reason why people tend to gather in big cities is that there are many opportunities to get a job. There are famous headquarter companies and branches that are based in foreign countries. Therefore, more and more people move to the big cities so that many taller apartments and buildings are built to let them live in the limited space. There seems to be stressful due to people being densely populated, but infrastructures are well organized, especially transport, medical care, and security.In contrast, the population in the countryside becomes less. Therefore, there is plenty of space to build houses in the wider area. It seems to be well-relaxed and comfortable to live in a slow-paced lifestyle. But, it is apparently more difficult to obtain a new job, and lacking transport, so they need to rely on cars. In addition, the number of hospitals is much smaller than big cities. These issues are long controversial as a first world problem.Finally, as Covid-19 spread worldwide, many people are started to work at home with a lap top computer. Innumerable companies adopted IT systems that are able to work remotely. In addition, some companies had already stated this systemized working style will not change, however, Covid-19 completely ended. This means that many people do not necessarily need to live in big cities. Therefore, if the transport system is well organized, especially establishing and improving a train, which works faster and more frequently. This effort will be not only helpful to dissipate the population outside of the big cities, but also promotive to tackling with great infrastructures to countrysides.In conclusion, as a result, the densely populated cities will be able to reduce its population and increase the population in the countryside. As a result, some issues will be resolved and become well-balanced solutions. Finally, it might be able to build wider houses in big cities with reasonable prices than now.; Often seen in large cities, high-rise construction can provide greater use of the area. These are two main methods of overcoming the shortage of housing in cities: either by erecting taller buildings or by expanding the area where houses are built. Each solution has its advantages and disadvantages, but in deciding which one is better, a balance between the requirements of the local population, its needs and the needs of the environment must be found. However, tall buildings allow a city to be built with a small area, and in addition they improve the view of the city and bring new tourists. The other advantage of high-rise construction is that it can protect greenery and agricultural land on the edges of the city. High-rise construction, which consumes a lot of energy for elevators and other city equipment, is very expensive. However, the disadvantages of high-rise construction include the possibility of overcrowding, isolation, which is possible when a large number of people live in a large building and there is no relationship between them. . This kind of expansion of the area where houses are built can lead to urban sprawl, depletion of natural resources, reliance on cars for transportation and even the development of socioeconomic differences due to the distance of essential services. This kind of development can lead to a decrease in congestion and better air quality than in crowded cities. Is it better to use both solutions? Or maybe it is the best to combine them? A solution combining high-rise construction in the city and well-planned suburban development would be the best solution to a growing population.
11;Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Athletes to be on the top need to have high-end facilities that a country can provide for them to be able to improve their strengths and skills. Some government opted to build facilities exclusively for training athletes for international sports goals, instead of building establishments for everyone to have the liberty of using the sports facilities. From my perspective, this phenomena is a negative development.Being able to discover an individual's potential, they need to have a support from any form of sources. Establishing sports facilities can help people to discover their own interests, talents and even skills in learning new things. Centers which offer utilities, equipments and state-of-the-art tools that provide learning sports can be a great advantage to people who want to train themselves on the things that can awaken their interests when it comes to sports.In addition, building these kind of establishments, not only for the purpose to train top athletes, but also for people to immerse themselves to different variaties of activities can help them socialize more with their peers. This is extremely beneficial that aside from doing sports that they are into, they get to play along with peers, discover one's potential and also learning from one another. Furthermore, these individuals can also have the future to be one of top athletes that a country can have.In conclusion, although there are countries that chose to have their sports establishments exclusively for training top athletes, I assert that these that actions can be lead to negative feedbacks. Government should allow everyone the privilege to use and avail facilities that can hone an individual's talents, skills and dexterity when it comes to sports and this can also be immensely benefical for both country and citizen alike.; To begin with, specialised facilities may lead to greater success in international sports. Countries that have invested in specialised training centres and high-tech coaches and equipment have often achieved excellence in international competition. However, this is a complex issue, and there are good arguments on both sides. For example, countries such as the United States and China have invested heavily in the training of their athletes, which has led to great success in events such as the Olympic games. However, this approach can have many disadvantages. High-tech sports environments teach discipline, focus and exceptional skills, which can lead to medals and international recognition. When sports facilities are only designed for a small number of elite athletes, many people feel excluded and even reject the benefits of sport and exercise, which can be extremely important for the health and mental well-being of a whole population. By concentrating on a small number of people, a country risks neglecting the right of its people to participate in sports. The absence of facilities for everyone to use limits opportunities for grassroots development, which is crucial for nurturing future talent and promoting overall health. It is best to combine specialised training facilities with a range of community sport and exercise programmes, which give access to aspirational sport for everyone and help to establish a culture of health and well-being. In my opinion, it is important for countries to encourage the development of international athletes, but a balance must be found between the two. For example, an inclusive sports environment is important for everyone, not only for international success, but also to improve the health of the nation as a whole.
725;Some educationalists say that every child should be taught how to play a musical instrument. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;It is commonly known that music has always played an important role in upbringing of children and a lot of parents wish their kids play a musical instrument. However, I disagree that this skill is essential to every pupil.First of all, not all people are born with a talent for music, which is essential if one wants to learn how to play it. Some people are natural musicians and succeed in this sphere with ease. On the other hand, there are children for whom learning to play is a hard work and, eventually, they might start hating music instead of enjoying it. Some people are bound to become excellent engineers or doctors and for them learning to read and play music is just a waste of time.Another important factor is that all kids are different and for that reason each of them desires to have a different hobby. If all pupils spent time on music, those who are not interested in it would have less time on things that are really exciting for them. Undoubtedly, everybody has a right to spend their free time in the way they want.What is more, playing a musical instrument is not considered to be an essential skill for a successful career. More time should be devoted to more important subjects, such as Math, Science and Languages. These have more chance to be useful for people when they grow up and graduate from school.To sum up, teaching all children to play an instrument wouldn't be a good idea. It should be taught only to those who really want it as not only would it ditract a child from subjects and hobbies which are more important in their opinion, but also it cannot be mastered by everybody.; You can be sure that the world has a very long debate about this, and there is a tendency to show that music education is very important. So I think that everyone should have the opportunity to learn an instrument. Music education has been shown to have positive effects on memory, attention and problem solving. Learning to play a musical instrument can benefit the brain in many ways. Playing a musical instrument develops emotional and social skills. Band practice and group performances teach children to cooperate and be disciplined. This is necessary for an integrated person to develop. However, it should also be noted that not all children have the same interest and the same talent for music. They also learn to express their emotions and develop empathy and self-esteem. And it is now well known that these social and emotional skills are important for success in the personal and professional spheres. In short, learning to play an instrument can bring many benefits to children, both intellectually and emotionally. So, while introducing music education is beneficial for all children, it should also be flexible and should accommodate children's interests and talents. Music education is a way of enriching the learning experience and providing the skills needed for life.
73;Some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The thought of some experts, is that people from rich countries are not satisfied by an ipotetical increase in their economy. In this essay I will discuss this point of view and I will explain why I am not sure I agree with that.It is generally believed by some professional figures, that additionals rise in economic wealth are not so crucial for a rich coutry. People from countries sush as Japan, the U.S.A, Switzerland or Cina are aware of their wide economic power and these governments offer a lot of benefits for their citizens. Thus, people have yet what they want, such as fundings for projects, well-organized cities, a lot of job opportunities. In fact, they do not fell a significant sense of satisfaction in the increase of their economy.Made this point, it is also true that some surveys used by The Italian University of Parma, reveal that citizens from coutries which a strong economy, are really grateful and satisfied by any additional rise, in the economic sector. As consequence due to this increase, they can ask more fundings for some start up or to improve the technology equipment in schools. Personally, I tend to think as a matter of fact that this is the right view. Because it is logical that more money mean more opportunities in any sector of the country. Hospitals, schools, museum and even historical buildings can have the possibility to obteind a lot of benefits.To conclude, in this essay I discuss the generel view of some experts about people from rich countries. I also explained why I strongly disagree with them.; I partly agree with this statement. There are, however, a few important differences to be considered. The relationship between a country's wealth and its citizens' satisfaction is a complex and diverse issue that is open to many opinions. A first difference is that in rich countries the most basic needs are usually met: citizens have access to good education, health care and well-maintained roads and transportation, which are the basis of their well-being. But the smaller additional benefits of economic growth do not seem to be of great importance when the basic needs have been satisfied. In rich countries, the added value of wealth diminishes, and people's happiness is increasingly influenced by factors that are not material. It has been proven that the quality of life, mental health, and sense of purpose in life increase after a certain income level. The relationship between citizens' well-being and wealth distribution is also very important. For example, increased expenditure on public transport, cultural initiatives and the environment not only makes life better, but also increases the satisfaction of citizens. I conclude that, although I agree that in rich countries, the effect of economic growth on the general satisfaction of citizens is limited, we must also consider the distribution of growth and the social implications of this growth. The quality of life and subjective well-being are influenced by a complex interplay of many different factors, and economic wealth is only one of them. If economic growth increases the gap between rich and poor, dissatisfaction can increase, even in a rich country.
1061;Some museums and art galleries charge admission fees, while others have free entry.Do you think the advantages of charging for admission outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many artistic places prefer to have an entry fee, whereas others let free access. I fully think that the benefits to have admission fees compensate the drawbacks to be not free.Many individuals would visit museum or art galleries if it were free which could attract more tourists. Unfortunately, admission charge decreases the possibility to discover paintings or masterpieces. However, before being a cultural place, art galleries are a place where numerous employees work. Indeed, if visitors had not to purchase the entrance, workforce would be not paid and the place would be not clean as museum should be. Moreover, huge museums as the British Museum have some sponsors to restore masterpieces whereas small museums have sometimes not the fundings and hence, admission fees would help it. Then, having an entry fee limit the number of individuals who do not really want to see art and appreciate the place.Concerning to cultural places, museum and art galleries know that many households could not afford ticket entrances for their offspring so many museums establish reduced price for teenagers and children. This project improves the relation between young people and the culture, then it allows children to be attracted to culture, partipate to the technical expenses behind the entry fee and after to visit again some cultural places when they will grow up and purchase the full price. Moreover, purchasing tickets help to the economy of the country which sometimes famous cultural places are a significant part of country's income. For instance, admission fees in museum are two third of the tourism's outcome in France.To conclude, I believe that admission fees should outweigh free entrance because it does not let the worth process of museum to work. Even if sometimes admission fees are costly for us, there is always a meaning behind the prices.; Charges for entry can be a significant source of income for museums and galleries. The debate about admission fees for museums and art galleries raises the question of their economic importance and social benefits. When these incomes are invested in modernization, improvements in security, and services to visitors, the experience for the visitor can be enhanced. For example, the British Museum uses the income from special exhibitions to preserve its vast collection and make it accessible to the public in a responsible way. Likewise, in a city such as Paris, where entry fees are common, many people may find these prohibitive and consequently limit their access to art and history. On the other hand, the disadvantages of admission charges must not be overlooked. On the one hand, institutions offering free entry often have to make difficult decisions about budgeting and long-term planning. Relying too heavily on government support or on charitable donations can be dangerous, especially during periods of economic hardship, when public finances are stretched. This can lead to a sense of exclusion and a weakening of cultural values in a community, since access to the arts should be a universal privilege. For this reason, a combination of free entry on certain days or to certain exhibitions can help ensure that all members of the community can enjoy the many benefits that these institutions provide, without having to make a financial contribution. In conclusion, while charging for admission brings in income and can improve the offering, it can also limit access for certain people.
1355;Some parents encourage young people to leave home while others think they should stay with the family, discuss and give your opinion;Many parents encourage young people to leave home when they become older, while others think they should stay at home with the family. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.With the tremendous influence of modernisation, remarkable changes have taken place in the family structure to such an extent that nowadays, youngsters are motivated by their parents to live alone as they grow up. However, some people are of the view that it is more practical for a youngster to live with their family.On the one hand, there are many positive aspects to youths living away from their parents at young age. This provides the opportunity to young people to live a life on their own terms and make any decisions without the interference of their parents. Besides, living alone not only makes them independent but also makes them self-reliant, which is a crucial life skill to their successful career. For instance, managing all the house chores such as cleaning, paying bills, cooking and so on will make them well experienced at learning and managing diverse activities and will also boost their confidence.On the other hand, there is no denying the fact that youngsters living away from their family may find themselves in circumstances that may adversely affect their life. Naïve and inexperienced young people in the absence of parental supervision are more likely to fall prey to bad influence and dangerous activities, such as drugs or alcohol consumption, which may jeopardise their career or lead them astray from moral values. However, this situation is less likely to take place with youngsters still living with their parents. Besides, emotional bonding and family relationships can be maintained better if everyone is living together under one roof.In my opinion, although encouraging youngsters to live alone may lead them to learn various life skills, negative aspects and risks associated with living alone can far outweigh the benefits.This response covers the task topic well, by discussing the positive and negative aspects of living alone as a young adult, and the writer’s opinion has also been included. Paragraphing helps to present ideas in an orderly way, and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay. There is some repetitive use of the word ‘make’ in the first body paragraph, which could have been avoided. Apart from that, the writer’s vocabulary seems to be quite rich and allows them to communicate ideas precisely and clearly. Overall, this essay seems to be worthy of IELTS Band 8.; : Young people who argue that young people should leave home and live independently of their parents argue that it is important for people to develop. On the other hand, those who support the young people staying with their parents argue that they have the right to live in the family and that the family is a source of comfort for the young people. Both views have their own advantages and disadvantages, and both are influenced by various cultural, economic, and psychological factors. This transition can be an important part of growing up, learning to be independent, and navigating challenges. It can also be a way to be more independent and self-confident and decide on its own. Some parents, however, support their children staying at home for a long time, often influenced by cultural values that emphasize close family ties and mutual support. Besides, it may also contribute to a stronger sense of identity and allow young people to explore their own beliefs and goals without having to answer family expectations. I think the decision should ultimately be based on the circumstances of each individual. Moreover, in a world that is becoming more unstable economically, having a stable support system may be important for young people as they deal with unemployment and debt. Young people should be encouraged to leave home when they are ready financially and emotionally to live on their own, but family guidance and support are important in the development of the necessary skills for a successful transition to adulthood. The best results are often achieved when young people are supported in their independence and the support they get from the family. It is therefore the right decision to focus on the welfare and success of young people in the long run.
1335;Some people believe that excessive use of modern technologies, such as computers and smartphones, is negatively affecting the reading and writing skills of our young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Parents and teachers in many countries are feeling increasingly concerned about the effect of digital devices on vital skills of school-aged children. They are alarmed by the declining ability of young people to read and write and its suspected link to the influence of modern technology, and I wholeheartedly share their view. This essay will outline the reasons to watch out for the consequences of widespread use of computers and mobile phones by our youngsters.Primary school is a very important period when children develop their fine motor skills, which are involved in learning to write. Time spent typing on a mobile phone or a tablet doesn’t contribute to the necessary workout of the small muscles in the hands and fingers of young people. Not only do they get less practice in writing but also fewer opportunities to train in spelling words, since the ‘autocorrect’ and ‘autocomplete’ features use the first few letters to guess the entire word, therefore making it unnecessary for the child to remember and type it correctly. Another companion of unrestrained use of mobile devices is the jargon that is often used in text messages, where words are shortened or distorted. Exposure to ‘texting’ tends to replace the correct words with abbreviations in young minds, causing their spelling accuracy to decline.Reading is another casualty of unrestricted access to smart devices. Video content can be more appealing and immersive for kids and they often are automatically drawn to it instead of books. Reading requires regular practice and needs to become a habit in order to fully develop as a skill; however, it is being perceived as a boring and labourious activity by many youngsters compared to effortless video-watching. Easy and instant access to videos and movies pushes books further down the list of preferences of young audience, and it takes a significant commitment from parents and teachers to ensure that children continue to read books.To sum up, modern technology can be a friend or a foe for young children, depending on the choices adults in their lives make, regulating the amount of screen time and its purpose. Without due care the writing and reading abilities of kids can be harmed by other, more enjoyable activities they can use the devices for."; On the one hand, critics of modern technology are talking about the social media, instant messengers, and the social environment as the main reason for the decline in reading and writing skills. The development of modern technology, especially the development of a computer and a smart phone, has undeniably changed the way people communicate, access information, and read literature. But while it is argued that this shift has a negative effect on the reading and writing skills of young people, I argue that the relationship between technology and literacy is more complex than the simple cause-and-effect narrative. The trend to consume short texts rather than in-depth literature can also lead to a superficial understanding of complex stories and themes. As a result, educators are concerned that critical thinking and analysis will decline. Many young people are more likely to be able to write a short sentence rather than a full word, and they also use more abbreviations and emojis than words. E-books, audio books, and educational platforms can provide interesting content for young people to read. On the other hand, technology is also a useful tool for improving literacy. Numerous applications and Internet resources allow us to interact with literature and encourage people to read more. These tools are very useful, but they need to be used carefully. There is no doubt that the development of the Internet has a positive effect on reading and writing skills. At the same time, the benefits of technology on reading and writing skills are ambiguous and context-dependent. However, technology can also be used to enhance traditional literacy skills, not replace them. So although there is a tendency for people to rely on technology, it is important to recognize the possibility of improving reading and writing skills. Teachers can create a rich and diverse learning environment by combining digital technology and traditional methods.
877;Some people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime. Others believe that there are better ways to reduce crime. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;The increasing number of criminals are appeared in a society where some people advocate the longer incarceration resulting in a reduction of crime. However, some are divided and think that a number of better ways can help lessen the cases of crime. Which strategy should be taken to tackle this problem? This essay attempts to explore the view of both sides.An increase in the rate of crimes is a raising concerns in the community. A longer prison sentence seems to be the straightforward method to impede the crimes caused. In fact, a continuous incarceration is no room for offenders to commit the crimes in the community. This seemingly becomes an immediate achievement in the short term period. Some people deeply believe the mindset of criminals can be eliminated by the deterrence effect of the longer sentences which deprive of a person's freedom in life. In addition, it is generally recognized that the offenders have to be punished in effect of their guilty acts. The outlaws deserve a lengthening prison term in which they repent their offenses resulting in a decline in the number of crimes.Indeed, the incarceration can limit the offender's actions in a place at some points. However, it is not difficult to find there is a higher rate of reoffending upon release from prison across the countries. In 2013, the U.S.A. had a reoffending rate of 52% which prisoners reoffended within a year of release with a record of 49.2% in the U.K. The proportion of reoffenders occupied nearly a half of criminals. It reveals that the prison sentences is not a effective way to decrease the number of criminal cases. This implies that a decline in the crimes can be achieved araising from a decline in the likelihood of reoffending. Rehabilitation during the course of their sentence can be adopted to tackle this problems. These include direct therapeutic interventions to address the psychological causes of criminal behaviours as well as services to prepare offenderes to successfully reintegrate into the community after release. Those actions include the provision of academic programmes, vocational courses and employment opportunities.My take on this is that the incarceration alone is rarely considered enough in the control of criminal cases. A longer prison term only increase the financial cost from the government, but it cannot lower the likelihood of criminal offenses. The governments have to address the root factors causing offenses is the prime issue to reduce the crimes.; The supporters of the longer prison sentence say that it will deter criminals, so that they will not commit crimes, and society will be safer. Those who oppose the longer sentence think that they will only make the criminals feel safer and that the crime rate will fall. Opponents of the longer sentence claim that this is not the most effective way to reduce crime. In addition, they say that longer sentences incapacitate criminals, and prevent them from committing new crimes while in prison. Statistics also show that repeat offenders have a significant impact on crime rates, and it is believed that by removing them from society, positive results can be achieved. Those who support the longer sentence claim that a longer sentence will not deter criminals, but will only make things worse, as the root causes of criminal behavior are not being dealt with. According to them, it is more effective to help those in need by providing them with education and support from the government. According to my point of view, although longer sentences may be a temporary solution to the reduction of crime, they will not help in the long run. The rehabilitation of criminals and better justice, as well as the reintegration of criminals into society, are more effective. In this way, not only can the crime rate be reduced, but the sense of belonging and support will increase.
379;Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;This essay agrees on the need of that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities, but always under one premise: those students should have demonstrated their capability to comply with university studies successfully.There are countries, for example Scandinavian countries, where their government helps students by giving them specific students' loans. These loans have special characteristics such as long loan terms and low interest rates. It is not for free, but at least a higher number of students can have access to upgrade their studies.And in many other European countries university fees are not large, so most of the students can access to bachelor studies. What it's not easy is having the needed qualification you need to access to the specific university study you want.If we talk in worlwide terms, university studies are limited to wealthy people.In fact I read only a couple of weeks ago that only a 17% of worlds' population have university studies. There is a contradiction between developped and non developped countries. As an example, in most countries in Europe we have too many university students. Actually they cannot find a job easily at their own country and sometimes they emigrate to another country in Europe or outside Europe. Furthermore vocational workers such as plumbers, waiters or receptionists can't be found, there no unemployment in vocational work!.The opposite happens in non developped countries. As university studies have large fees, almost nobody can access to them, and vocational workers suffer unemployment, so they need to emigrate to other countries to find jobs.To summarize, I believe fees should not be an obstacle to study in a university. The obstable should be your previous califications.Education and Health, as much as a country can hold them, should be available for all population, poor and wealthy, with non differentiation.; I think that the government should pay full course fees for university students, because the right to education is a fundamental human right and must be available to everyone, regardless of social status. Although there are many convincing arguments for and against this statement, I firmly believe that governments should pay full course fees for university students. And investing in education brings significant long-term economic benefits. Governments could also save money by subsidizing higher education, so that talented people from less well-off backgrounds could enter the workforce. Universities that take the course fees from students also benefit the economy, as evidence shows that employees with higher qualifications have higher productivity and lower unemployment, which benefits the economy by reducing taxes and welfare spending. It is also true that a highly educated workforce is needed to develop and maintain competition in an increasingly globalized world. Universities that charge students full course fees also contribute to the economy by increasing the amount they receive from taxes. Besides, there are many ways to help students that governments could consider, such as performance-based funding and rewarding students for choosing a course that supports national interests, so that government spending is both effective and efficient. In conclusion, I believe that governments should pay full course fees for university students. The responsibility of investing in education should be shared by governments, so that we can build a stronger and more prosperous society for everyone. This policy will not only promote equality and equality of opportunity, but will also be consistent with long-term economic strategies to build a strong and educated workforce.
1428;Some people believe that having a pet such as a cat or a dog helps old people to live a more enjoyable life and to stay healthier. How do you think old people benefit from having a pet? Do you think there are any problems related to old people who have pets?;, and indeed, the importance of relationship between human beings and their pets has been proved to be slightly exaggerated in some nations. However, although problems regarding may affect the health conditions of old people, the benefits that these lovely animals bring to them, physically and mentally alike, are clearly undeniable.In of physical benefits, the well-being of elderly people with pets compared to those without pets, since not only do they have to take care of themselves, the responsibility ensure their one fed and well looked after encourages them to become even more active. Due to these extra activities, this might not have an obvious influence on their health, but at least this could help them to avoid bad . Coupled with physical side, their mental wellbeing will also be improved, and the reason is that having someone to take care of would reduce the chance of feeling . Therefore, their could be minimised.In spite of the above advantages, the interaction between pets and vulnerable old people still exist. One of the major concerns is the of these animal on their tracheas, especially those asthma. virtually invisible in the air, many asthma symptoms are caused unconsciously by pets. In addition to the fact that old people might experience difficulty in looking after their pets, as their health conditions are limited, could become even more when they try take care of others.In conclusion, it is true that obstacles still exist for elderly people in adopting pets, but the benefits of this topic its . For such reasons, instead of , further support would be far more beneficial.; I think the benefits of a pet are the most profound. For example, old people who live alone or who have lost their families often feel lonely. Having a cat or a dog with them is a very good way to make them feel better. Also, there are some physical benefits that help old people live a healthier life. They are very friendly to people and a good relationship with the family. The relationship with a pet decreases depression and anxiety, which helps people feel more relaxed and happy. A pet also creates a fixed routine for the care of a pet that needs to be fed, groomed and walked. Having a dog can help old people keep fit, build up their stamina and strength, and avoid heart attacks and osteoporosis. However, there are also some problems related to pet ownership in the elderly. Also, money is needed for food, medicine and other expenses, which can be a burden for the old person. I think the main problem is that the pet needs to be taken care of, and people with physical disabilities or illnesses should not take care of the pet. The old person must also be careful about the possible loss of the pet, which is very painful for the old people who have already lost many things in their lives. In conclusion, although there are many benefits for old people, such as having a good relationship with a pet, physical and mental health, and more fun, the disadvantages must also be considered. A wise choice of a pet can be an advantage for old people, which can lead to an enjoyable and healthier life for the old people.
1300;Some people believe that homework should not be given to school children. Others, however, say that homework is an important requirement for children to be able to develop appropriately. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The benefits of giving or not giving homework to children are often debated. Some people feel that children have enough work to do during one day whilst at school, whereas others feel that the more work set, the better.It is true that schools today place more and more demands and pressure on children. The competition to do well, to enter a good university and to get a good job is significant. This has led to the ideology that children should do as much schoolwork as possible in order to help their intellectual development. The argument, however, that more is better is not always valid. There comes a point, especially for a child, when more knowledge cannot be absorbed in a day. When a child has possibly 7 or 8 classes a day on different subjects, he or she is processing a lot of information already. To give more work to be done at home, therefore, would be pointless and even counterproductive. In addition to this, although it is important to be educated, childhood should also be a time when there is an opportunity to just play and enjoy unstructured time. Homework can significantly lessen the possibilities of doing this.On the other hand, it can be argued that there is a place for homework. If study at school is not overdone, the opportunity to look at work again and extend ideas can be an invaluable exercise. It’s easy to forget one thing that has been taught once, but if that concept is revisited a second time, the brain has time to reprocess and likely better understand and remember.It seems to me that there is a place for homework for today’s children. What must be remembered, though, is that homework needs to be limited to age-appropriate parameters, so that a balance can be struck between study and free time and relaxation.; On one side of the fence, many parents, teachers and students are against homework because it causes stress and a lack of leisure time, while on the other side it is argued that homework is an important part of a child's development. One example of this is that a child who is used to math problems at home is better at math than one who only does it in class. Moreover, homework can lead to a greater sense of responsibility and discipline, and a student who practices doing his homework at home learns to plan his own time and learn how to be more organized. In addition, the homework opponents argue that a child should have time to play, be with his friends and participate in family life, and that after a long day of school he should be able to relax without having to do homework. Homework can be a good thing, but it should not be a dominating thing, it should be balanced and adapted to the age, the individual learning pace and the child's circumstances. Many students have complained about the pressure to complete extensive homework, which detracts from their overall educational experience. At the end of the day, the purpose of education is to develop good, human beings, not only well-qualified, and homework should support this goal and not work against it. It is important to focus on meaningful homework that enhances critical thinking and creativity and not rote learning.
1369;Some people believe that preserving natural environment is crucial, but make no effort to do so (reasons and solutions);Some people believe that preserving natural environment is crucial, however, most make no effort to do so. Why do you think this is happening? What are some simple actions that could help the environment?It is commonly believed that preservation of natural resources is imperative, yet most people seem to exert no effort in doing so. Understanding the causes of this negligent attitude may help with devising some simple measures to safeguard the deteriorating environment.Lack of awareness is probably the foremost reason why the vast majority of individuals appears to be unmindful of the current environmental issues. Normally, people have tendency to downplay abstract problems, or those to happen in the distant future. This is because they are not properly informed of the possible detrimental effects of taking the environment for granted. To illustrate, residents in urban areas often deliberately dump their into the nearby creeks and drainage canals causing them to become clogged. It is only when devastating floods strike, that they come to realize the consequences of their actions.Some basic solutions that could be carried out are extensive awareness through all forms of communication and strict implementation of waste management. In addition to the traditional press, social media is a powerful means of disseminating information regarding the impending disasters and their potential hazards. This is a good way of persuading the public to actively take part in the campaign. Another straightforward solution, and by far the least anyone can do to help save the nature is disposing of garbage thoughtfully. Apart from avoiding throwing trash anywhere, everyone should practice proper segregation of biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and recyclable wastes at all times. These actions, when coordinated by the local governments, can be tremendously successful.In conclusion, while individual awareness is key to maintaining a healthy ecosystem, concerted efforts of governments and are much more effective in achieving such goal.The response is well written, it contains reasons, solutions and fully addresses the task. The ideas aren’t repeated, they are conveyed in a clear and easy to understand manner and organised well with sufficient use of cohesive devices. The vocabulary is varied, sentence structures are complex and instances of incorrect grammar are hardly noticeable. Overall, this essay is likely to achieve Band 8 in IELTS.; The main reason why some people may believe in the importance of preserving the natural environment, but not do so, is ignorance. It is necessary to understand this contradiction to find solutions. This lack of understanding leads to a feeling of powerlessness, so people may prefer immediate comfort to long-term conservation. There is a lot of information about climate change and loss of natural habitats, but people are not informed about the impact of their daily activities or are overwhelmed by the scale of the problem. Single-use plastic and fast fashion, for example, are convenient, but also have a large impact on the environment. The second reason is the convenience of the modern lifestyle. Awareness and education campaigns are crucial to counteract these influences. Schools, community groups and the media can be crucial in informing the public about the environmental impact of their actions. To change these people’s behavior, people need to be more sustainable and change their daily habits. To help with this, governments and businesses should make sustainable options more available. The first is that conservation is a collective responsibility, but the second is that it is an individual responsibility. Therefore, by facilitating a deeper understanding between people and the environment, governments and businesses can help to bridge the gap between beliefs and actions, and help people to be more sustainable.
1322;Some people believe that the best way to solve environmental problems is to increase the price of fuel.Do you agree or disagree?;"Raising the price of car fuel is believed by some people to be an excellent method to solve the growing number of environmental issues. However, I strongly disagree with this idea, as doing so would make life difficult for lower-income households. While making fuel more expensive wouldn’t change the habits of wealthy families, switching to fossil fuel alternatives could prove to be much more beneficial for the environment.The most compelling reason against raising the cost of fuel is that the upper classes of society will hardly be affected by rising fuel costs, as this only makes up a minor proportion of their expenditure. They will continue to use their personal vehicles as they wish without a thought for the environment or the higher fuel prices, even if their country has state-of-the-art public transportation.Those who will feel the crunch of this decision are the middle-class and lower-income households, since travelling is a major part of most people’s routine, be it to work, school or shopping. Driving is almost unavoidable in many instances; therefore, raising the price of petrol would only serve to widen the gap between the rich and poor, and serve as an inadvertent form of discrimination.Another reason why increasing the cost of fuel is far from the best way to deal with environmental pollution is that now there are much more viable alternatives. Due to the rapid advances in technology, scientists and engineers have been able to develop several alternatives to fossil fuel, such as cars powered by electricity or naturally produced biofuel. The move to adopt clean energy sources instead of fossil fuels is a much more promising alternative compared to simply making fuel more expensive.In conclusion, I believe that governments of the world should invest more time and money in finding alternatives to fossil fuels that are more environmentally friendly, rather than simply raising the cost of petrol."; One of the methods that has been suggested to combat the rising specter of the damage to the environment is to raise the price of fuel. While this theory is not without merit, I would argue that this is not the most effective or only way to respond to the increasing urgency of the problem. There are several benefits to be derived from this policy. Firstly, the higher the price of fuel, the more people will seek to reduce their use of it. For example, the government might offer subsidies for public transport, car pooling, and bicycles, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as well as decreasing reliance on fossil fuels. Higher fuel prices may have a disproportionate effect on the poorest households and individuals who, because of their dependence on vehicles for their transport to work or the provision of essential goods, are unable to adapt to higher costs quickly. Consequently, higher fuel costs may have a detrimental effect on their well-being, rather than on the environment. However, although increasing the price of fuel may be effective in the short term, there are negative social consequences to this policy. Moreover, to have a long-term effect on the environment, a more comprehensive strategy must be adopted, including an increase in the production of alternative energy, more stringent regulations on emissions, and an increased awareness of the importance of sustainable practices. In the short term, the raising of the price of fuel is unlikely to lead to the comprehensive change in the environment that many desire. But a combination of education, an investment in alternative energy, and an increased reliance on sustainable practices is needed to make progress. In conclusion, raising the price of fuel may be a useful short-term measure, but it is not the sole solution to the problems facing the environment. A combination of education, an investment in alternative energy, and the provision of subsidies for greener practices will be required to bring about the desired change. To be successful, a broader policy must be adopted that encompasses not only economic but also social and political factors.
1273;Some people believe that we cannot learn anything from the past for our life today, while others believe that history is a valuable source of information to understand human's life.Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is true that these days people say there is little we can gain from previous history, whereas others think that history is a key source to understand our lives. Although there are some strong arguments against learning history, I agree with learning history to know life of human.There are two reasons why people think there is nothing to gain from history. Firstly, there is evidence to support the idea that learning history stresses people out. Based on a survey conducted by Standford University, 57 percent of people consider learning past life of humans a primary source of stress, while less than 6 percent of people said studying previous humans' life was not a stressor. Secondly, people may not have time to remember historical events because the constant stimulation and hustle and bustle of society is holding them back from their life. In turn, they are more likely to regard learning history as useless.Despite the negative drawbacks, I support that historical event is great information to comprehend human's life. The main benefit of a historical event is that it can have a positive impact on people, especially children, as they grow up. Since history has more connection and support to our lives, it allows children to become more insightful and knowledgeable and discover advanced perspectives. For example, I have been widening my perspective through historical events in my family or country because gaining history regarding my family and nation taught me the right attitude to understand today. However, if I did not know any history, I would not have had an opportunity to understand human life and self-development. So, learning history should be encouraged.In conclusion, while I recognize the possible disadvantages of learning history, I believe that the benefits of gaining past events far outweigh them in the long term.; Some people say that the past is of little relevance to the present, especially in this age of rapid technological progress and social change. They believe that every generation has to deal with its own problems that are difficult to learn from the past. This is a complex debate, with good arguments on both sides. Advocates of this view point claim that clinging to old ideas and philosophies can stifle creativity and hinder progress. On the other hand, many people argue that history is a rich source of knowledge and experience that can guide decisions both in the present and in the future. For example, in the field of global warming, data protection, and globalization, modern solutions are often very different from those in the past. But it is useful to see how events have developed, what causes they have, and how they can be used to prevent them from happening again. History also shows the long-term consequences of decisions and reveals the extent to which the population has changed. For example, the Nazi regime and World War II serve as a reminder of the dangers of nationalist and intolerant behavior and influence policies to encourage more tolerance and peace. Historical developments in the field of social justice, such as the civil rights movement in the 1960s, can be of great importance for current discussions about equality and justice. I think that, although the context may change, the fundamental lessons of history remain valid. That is why it is important to find the right balance between modern creativity and historical knowledge. By learning from the past, we can avoid making the same mistakes and benefit from the achievements of the past.
1342;Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military, while others disagree (opinion);Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military. Others think that women are less suitable for this kind of job. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Sample EssayIn recent years gender equality in employment has been the topic of heated debate. While some may argue that women are less suited for certain jobs such as with the police or the military, I believe that female candidates should be treated the same as their male counterparts.Those who consider women to be unsuited for some kinds of jobs including the police or the military often hold that opinion because such jobs are extremely physically demanding. As the female body has smaller muscles and less physical strength compared to male body, women may have difficulty engaging in strenuous activity which can be exhausting even for men. In military service, female soldiers are more likely to struggle while defending themselves than their male peers when they are forced to move around carrying heavy firearms in the battle, which can increase their risk of mission failure. Because of the hazards and extreme conditions they may encounter, some people advocate that women are not suitable for work in these fields.Nevertheless, I believe that female applicants should be considered for police or military placements without a gender bias, because women are more suited to certain tasks. In the police service, female officers can perform important roles on some occasions such as a body search where male officers are restricted from touching female convicts. In the military service, female nursing staff are more likely to care better for injured soldiers since maternal instinct makes them dedicated and heart-warming professionals. Furthermore, for the sake of fairness to all, job seekers should have an equal opportunity to choose their jobs freely, regardless of gender. Many women have the desire to work in the police and the military and some of them have relevant expertise and qualifications. Therefore, they should not be discriminated against in employment opportunities for these jobs.In conclusion, although some say that women are incompatible with police and military duties because of the high physical demands, I believe that they should be treated as equal to men. This is because there are certain roles with the police and the military that are more suitable for women than men, and therefore both genders should have equal employment opportunities.; According to those who support the equality of women in police and military service, abilities are evaluated according to individual merit, not gender. While those who advocate equality claim that women are equally capable of performing these roles as men, those who argue that such professions may be demanding physically may necessitate gender-related differentiation. Women have often emphasized that they excel in communication, conflict resolution, and negotiation, which are essential skills in any operational environment. Furthermore, it is argued that the presence of women in these fields can have a positive effect on public opinion, particularly with minority groups, as women may serve as a source of trust and communication. These views are in contrast to the claim that police and military roles require a high degree of physical fitness and resilience that may not be uniformly available to women. According to these critics, imposing the same standards on all individuals without regard for their physiological differences could compromise safety and efficacy in critical situations. In the end, however, despite the presence of valid arguments on both sides, the integration of women in the police and military is necessary in modern society. This is because such a blanket policy would not account for the wide variety of roles in these organizations. This said, ensuring that all potential employees are able to perform their tasks effectively and with the highest level of efficiency remains the most important consideration. By basing the assessment of individual applicants on their qualifications, skills, and abilities rather than their gender, a more inclusive environment can be created.
1376;Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research (discuss);Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research for the benefit of human beings, while others argue that it is wrong. Discuss both views and give your opinion.People have different views on how medical research should be conducted and tested. Although many people support the use of for developing medicines, I personally believe that animal testing is morally wrong.The main reason why some people value to conduct medical research is because animal testing has contributed to many life-saving cures and treatments. It is true that nearly every medical breakthrough in the last 100 years has resulted directly from research using animals. For example, experiments in which dogs had their pancreases removed led directly to the discovery of insulin, critical to saving the lives of diabetics. Furthermore, it is impossible to release to the market before proving it no harm to humans and laboratory mice are appropriate research subjects because they are similar to human beings in many ways.However, I people who consider medical development that involved the use of animals cruel and unacceptable. I believe that the lives of all creatures should be respected and we, humans, have no right to for our own benefits. Governments should invest in developing alternative methods that can replace when doing medical research. For example, a software program can be developed to model a human immune system and new drugs can be tested on the software rather than animals. In this way, no animals will suffer from the medical tests and the society can still benefit from medical development.In conclusion, although it is undoubtedly true that animal testing has helped scientists in drug developments and medical discoveries, I believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused to animals and we should use alternative methods when doing medical research that do not involve animals suffering.This is a great essay. It addresses the two sides of the argument by exploring reasons why animals should and should not be used in medical research. The ideas are well explained and supported by examples. The use of paragraphing is efficient and helps with logical sequencing of ideas. Linking words are used appropriately to achieve the necessary cohesion. Author’s meaning is skillfully conveyed by the use of wide range of vocabulary. Even though there are some inaccurately used expressions, they don’t hinder understanding. Most sentences are error-free, instances of faulty grammar are rare. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.; Supporters of the use of animals in medical research say that they are very important in advancing medical knowledge and finding ways to help people. The use of animals in medical research is a topic that inspires heated debate among ethicists, scientists and the general public. Animals, which are similar to humans in many ways, serve as models for the study of complex physiological processes and the development of diseases. For example, the research on mice and monkeys has given us important insights into diseases such as cancer, AIDS and diabetes, which have a major impact on millions of people. Many medical treatments such as vaccinations, surgical techniques and chemotherapy have been developed through the use of animals. Opponents of the use of animals in medical research argue that animals are capable of experiencing pain, fear and stress, as people do, and therefore it is unethical to cause them suffering for human advancement. In this sense, it is possible to argue that the benefits to human health can justify the use of animals in medical research. They are especially concerned with the question of whether the end justifies the means, arguing that no human benefit can justify harming living creatures. They call for the development of alternative methods such as in vitro testing and computer simulation, which could reduce or even eliminate the need for animal experiments. To this end, it is important to continue to explore and develop alternatives to animal research. A balanced approach that seeks to reduce animal suffering while still advancing medical science may be the most humane.
1057;Some people feel that entertainers such as film stars, pop musicians or sports stars are paid too much money.Do you agree or disagree?Which other types of job should be highly paid?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Jobs such as actors, musicians or athlete earns a lot of money, however, a part of people argued that these kinds of people are overpaid. In my opinion, I disagree with this view and believes that they deserved the high salary.People who works as a movie stars, musicians and sports player deserved high money paid. This is because they advocated all there time and effort to get the salary that they have today. Before they become famous, they only have few incomes or even get nothing. That is to say, many musicians did not get any payment at the begining of their career, so do the actors and sports players, they spent their time but do not get any money. For instance, before being a well-known musicians, they have to spend their own money on buying equipment to produce musics or to public the songs they have made. Also, the creativety and their works cannot be measured by money. Thus, they deserved high salary because of their profession and uncopyable works.Jobs which needs professional skills and the job envolves high risk shoul also be highly paid. Such as doctors and programmers, their job are unplaceable because these envolved professional knowledge that not everyone had. Moreover, people works in high-risk environment deserved high payment too. For example, fire-fighters, they might got hurt or even die while working. Therefore, higher salary is needed for jobs that need special skills and career with high risk.To sum up, I agree with the statement because of the reasons above, and jobs with special knowledge and people works in dangerous environment should also be highly paid.; I think that a great part of what they do is providing entertainment and therefore they should not be paid as much as other important professions. To my mind, the salary of an entertainer should not be as high as that of a policeman, a teacher, a nurse, a prison warden or a schoolteacher. Teachers who are responsible for shaping the minds of the next generation are poorly paid, in spite of their enormous influence on society. Doctors who saved so many people during the CovId epidemic are also poorly paid. Lastly, while entertainers should be paid what they deserve for their work, I think the high salaries of some entertainers distort the whole idea of society’s priorities. In countries where there is a great difference between the income of entertainers and that of essential workers in the service industry, a culture can develop which gives low priority to education, health care and the public service. It seems to me that the salaries of people who work directly for the benefit of the general public, such as those in education and health care, should be higher in order to encourage more social equality and to show proper respect for the work they do.
1289;Some people feel that fashion is like art and a significant part of society, while others feel that fashion is a waste of time and money.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"The fashion industry today is an important component of society and people’s lives. It is true that many people care little for clothes and scorn the importance that others attach to them; however, this does not mean that the significance that people give to fashion is a waste of time and money.When one considers that areas of the world suffer from poverty, disease and inadequate access to food and clean water, the emphasis attached to fashion by the developed world can seem out of proportion. Many people would contend that the resources put into developing and creating fashion would be more ethically spent on creating some level of equality in terms of the right to live a healthy and happy life. This point is hard to argue with. However, it is also true that people in the developed world cannot be expected to send all their spending money to people in need and that wanting to look good is an unalterable human trait.The fashion industry contributes to the society much like most other industries. It provides jobs and income to millions of people around the world and the money that changes hands generates taxes that contribute to the fabric of society. There is more to fashion than trying to look better than others and excessive luxury. The high level of fashion is indeed a kind of art form and, like other art forms, there will always be people who appreciate it, want to create it and want to spend money on it. It is part of the development of civilisation and this is not likely to change.I therefore feel that, although the gap between the rich and the poor sometimes makes it seem that fashion is a waste of time and money and an unethical use of resources, fashion is an important part of today’s society and economic output. This leads me to believe that trying to strike a balance between selfish greed and a more altruistic way of living should be an individual choice."; Fashion is a complex phenomenon that evokes a variety of opinions. On the one hand, fashion is seen as art and society as an important social expression. Some fashion lovers argue that clothing and other items of clothing are a canvas for creativity and are a way for designers to express their own artistic and social views. Fashion is also a way for individuals to express their identity, their beliefs and their social position. In the same way that a film director or painter is able to present ideas and problems in society, fashion can also present ideas and problems. For example, Alexander McQueen and Vivienne Westwood have presented in their collections on topics such as identity, class and the environment and thereby influenced the public debate. On the other hand, fashion is seen as a superficial phenomenon by many who emphasize the consumerism and the short life span that the fashion industry often has and which is harmful to the environment and the economy. For example, subcultures such as punk and goth have used fashion to present their dissent and opposition to the norms and values of society, and this shows that fashion can also function as a significant cultural phenomenon. The way people dress can make them feel a sense of belonging or highlight their individuality, and they can therefore use their dress as a means of communication to the outside world. In my opinion, although fashion can also be seen as a superficial distraction, it also plays an important role as an artistic expression and social expression. According to this view, fashion companies that produce cheap and short-lived styles represent this view since they also contribute to the devastation of the environment and exploit the work situation. Fashion's artistic expression and social significance must be combined with a commitment to ethical principles to be able to take full advantage of its potential.
1294;Some people feel that learning a foreign language is an essential component of a child’s education. Others feel that learning a foreign language is often a waste of time that can be better spent on learning about technology and other more vocational subjects.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Throughout the history of education, learning a foreign language or languages has been a constant component. Of course, many people feel that this is really an unnecessary part of education for everyone, but this is not a point of view that I share.The opponents to learning a foreign language might argue that most people do not travel that often outside their own country. In addition to this, out of all the countries of the world, comparatively not many share the same language. Therefore, learning a foreign language will only be useful for the very limited time that one spends in a country where this language is used. For some people, the language might never be used in their entire lives. When one thinks about how much time and money are spent training language teachers, buying resources, going on trips and delivering lessons for such a negligible benefit, this would seem to be a very inefficient allocation of resources.However, the benefits of learning a foreign language go further than just the ability to use it from time to time on a holiday or business trip. Firstly, through learning one language, one gains an understanding to some extent of how all languages work. Thus, no matter where people might end up around the world, the knowledge of language can be of use. Secondly, with the study of a foreign language, one also opens oneself up to other cultures. This allows in turn an appreciation for different points of view and belief systems. With an ever-shrinking world due to globalisation, the ability to empathise and understand the people from other countries is vital to reducing conflict and creating a more tolerant society. Finally, quite simply learning languages is excellent for the improvement of general cognitive skills.It seems to me that learning a foreign language, therefore, is more than just gaining the ability to speak a few words of a foreign tongue. It is part of intellectual and social development and needs to be continued for everyone in today’s schools.; Supporters of the view that learning a foreign language is an essential part of a child’s education claim that it increases the child’s mental abilities, cultural awareness and future career opportunities. Opponents argue that the time spent learning a foreign language would be better spent on more vocational subjects. As the pace of globalization accelerates, the importance of learning multiple languages becomes more important in the job market. On the other hand, proponents of foreign language education point to its importance in the development of the mental abilities of children. Recent studies have shown that learning a second language increases a child’s creative abilities, his ability to solve problems and his ability to manage time. And, of course, learning a foreign language is a great way to develop a child’s understanding of different cultures. Many businesses, such as international business, tourism and diplomacy, are looking for employees who can bridge language barriers, and bilingual candidates are a very valuable asset. On the other hand, some people believe that in this age of digitalization, learning coding, engineering and data analysis will bring children greater career opportunities. A child who studies Spanish can learn about Hispanic cultures and history, which enriches his education. In my opinion, although technical skills are undoubtedly important, learning a foreign language should not be regarded as a waste of time. For example, the study of Python and Javascrip, which are currently popular, can be considered a more practical choice for the job market. But both of these are important components of a child’s education. A combination of both will bring children to a place where they can thrive in a world that is becoming more connected and competitive.
1073;Some people feel that the design of newly constructed buildings in big cities should be controlled by governments. Others believe those who finance the construction of a building should be free to design it as they see fit.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is often argued that governments should involve in construction's design in huge cities, while others argued that governments do not have to retrict the free of designers' imagination if those designs are splendid fit on the cities. I believe that if that were to happen, it would be the positive development. This essay will highlight the both views and give personal opinion from the former argument's side.To begin with latter opinion, although governments have worried about the combination of buildings entirely, the strong limitation about design can cause squandering of designers' skills. There are huge number of competitions about designing building in this society, and the evolution in these fields has developed dramatically. However, if there is a strict criteria on design of building, the majority of intelligences do not need to hammer away to come up with revolutional outline for building.On the other hand, signitured design of the big cities by itself can be the purpose of trevelling as a landmark, and it can be followed by significant economical achievement in the country. To take myself as an example, in 2017, I went to Gold Coast for study automotive engineering, and I was stunnied becaused of the atmosphere which is formed by combination of similar buildings and beach. Furthermore, according to the research from Sydney university, Gold Coast is one of the cities which make a fortune because of marvelous view.To sum up with, I would therefore argue that in spite of the fact that building design restriction can influence on architects negatively, it has a potential ability to make a significant profit in the future.; On the one hand, those who support government regulation argue that standardized building regulations create harmony, protect the local culture and contribute to the well-being of the city, but those who advocate freedom of design emphasize the role of creativity and individuality in the development of the city. From the point of view of those who support the regulated city, there are several advantages: 1) by unifying the city’s appearance, 2) by making it more energy efficient and 3) by reducing waste in the city. In addition, according to the supporters of government control, architects and planners must respect the unified urban design, especially in the old parts of the city. Then the government can protect the environment, prevent overcrowding and protect public spaces. Moreover, the government can create and implement building codes that regulate the development of the city and make it more attractive. In my opinion, however, the best solution is the balance between two positions: the government should establish building standards that will allow for the implementation of sustainable building practices and the unity of historical neighborhoods, but it should allow investors to create within these guidelines. Cities such as Dubai and New York are examples of how unregulated design has led to unique and modern buildings, such as the Burj Khalifa and One World Trade Center, changing the city’s image and bringing a new sense of modernity to the city. On the other hand, by balancing freedom and government control, cities can evolve and become dynamic, showing their uniqueness and development. For example, modernizing the historical quarter with modern buildings will combine the old with the new and create a city that is both practical and beautiful.
1292;Some people feel that with the rise of artificial intelligence, computers and robots will take over the roles of teachers. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;With ever increasing technological advances, computers and robots are replacing human roles in different areas of society. This trend can also be seen in education, where interactive programs can enhance the educational experience for children and young adults. Whether, however, this revolution can also take over the role of the teacher completely is debatable, and I oppose this idea as it is unlikely to serve students well.The roles of computers and robots can be seen in many areas of the workplace. Classic examples are car factories, where a lot of the repetitive precision jobs done on assembly lines have been performed by robots for many years, and medicine, where diagnosis, and treatment, including operations, have also been assisted by computers for a long time. According to the media, it won’t also be long until we have cars that are driven automatically.It has long been discussed whether robots and computers can do this in education. It is well known that the complexity of programs can now adapt to so many situations that something can already be set up that has the required knowledge of the teacher, along with the ability to predict and answer all questions that might be asked by students. In fact, due to the nature of computers, the knowledge levels can far exceed a teacher’s and have more breadth, as a computer can have equal knowledge in all the subjects that are taught in school, as opposed to a single teacher’s specialisation. It seems very likely, therefore, that computers and robots should be able to deliver the lessons that teachers can, including various ways of differentiating and presenting materials to suit varying abilities and ages of students.Where I am not convinced is in the pastoral role of teachers. Part of teaching is managing behaviour and showing empathy with students, so that they feel cared for and important. Even if a robot or computer can be programmed to imitate these actions, students will likely respond in a different way when they know an interaction is part of an algorithm rather than based on human emotion.Therefore, although I feel that computers should be able to perform a lot of the roles of teachers in the future, they should be used as educational tools to assist teachers and not to replace them. In this way, students would receive the benefits of both ways of instruction.; This is my opinion. In my opinion, it is undeniable that artificial intelligence and robots have a lot of teaching tools and resources, but I don't think they can completely replace teachers. The first reason is that teaching is not just about teaching, but also about the interaction between people, empathy and understanding. Human teachers can recognize the slight changes in children's expressions and change their teaching methods accordingly to form a harmonious relationship between children and teachers. Although artificial intelligence is very powerful, it still lacks the emotional intelligence that makes it very difficult for people to establish a good relationship with students. It is difficult for robots to realize the various needs of students and the characteristics of different classes. The second reason is that teaching is not just about teaching knowledge, but also about creativity, critical thinking, and the ability to inspire and motivate students. Artificial intelligence has a lot of learning tools and resources, but it cannot replace teachers. Even though the artificial intelligence system can help the teachers to complete some of the work, such as sorting and classifying data, and giving some suggestions for the learning of different children, it cannot meet the needs of different children. To sum up, although artificial intelligence and robots have the ability to change the teaching environment and make a lot of changes, the value of human teachers cannot be ignored. Because education is a unified whole, and human beings will always be in high demand, rather than artificial intelligence and robots being viewed as a substitute, it is more appropriate to see them as a pedagogical assistant to complement human teachers.
1285;Some people like to own the place where they live, but other people like to rent where they live. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The debate over whether it is better to own or rent the property in which one lives is one that has strong supporters on each side. There are persuasive arguments for both points of view.One of the main advantages of renting a property is flexibility. Usually, a tenant only has to give a month’s notice before changing where he or she lives. If a property is owned and a change is needed, the property must be put onto the market and it is frequently a long and stressful process to get a sale completed. Sometimes, the wrong time of year or a bad market can mean that a sale is not possible. Another advantage of renting is that a large amount of a family’s capital is not tied up in the property. Property can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and often a lot more. If one rents, this money can be spent on other things to help improve the family’s quality of life. If the property is on a mortgage, then the deposit, also often very large, is tied up in the property and the pressure of having to make substantial payments every month can cause a lot of stress.Owning a property does have various advantages, though. Even though people usually have to service a mortgage every month with payments, this money is then built up with the property. With renting, the money is lost to the landlord, but at the end of the term of the mortgage, the whole property is owned by the family. This makes the process of living in a property a type of investment. In addition, the property’s value often goes up after time, frequently creating a substantial profit. Owning the property where one lives can also create a sense of well-being and self-actualisation.The decision to whether one rents or owns the property in which one lives really boils down to individual preference. My opinion is that it is much more preferable to own a property, mainly because it creates a valuable asset for the family.; On the one hand, home ownership is seen as a basic requirement for financial security and stability. Home ownership can also be an important long-term investment, as property prices tend to rise. This can create wealth. In addition, home owners have the freedom to personalize their homes without the restrictions imposed by the landlords, which makes people feel more attached to the home and the community. In New York and San Francisco, people have been able to build their wealth by buying properties. And for some people, especially younger people and people with less stable careers, renting offers a lot of freedom. If a tenant finds a better job opportunity, he can move easily, explore other neighborhoods and experience the variety of different lifestyles without worrying about the long-term mortgage. Home ownership also has the advantage of making people feel more secure and stable, which is particularly important for families that want to establish roots in the community. To some extent, it is also more important for people to move to urban areas for career opportunities. In my opinion, the choice of ownership or rental depends on the individual needs and the situation at the right time. Renting is also usually easier to maintain, and the landlords are often responsible for maintenance and repairs, which can lead to a more carefree life. Both ownership and rental have their own advantages and disadvantages. People should take their own personal goals, financial situation and lifestyle into consideration before making a decision. Young people starting their careers may be more inclined to rent than own a home that meets their long-term needs.
1405;Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding changes. Others, however think that change is always a good thing. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;Nowadays, people are arguing whether an ideal lifestyle should be a stable one or should it include a wide ranges of changes.In my opinion, whether changes are needed should be determined the of you are at.Apparently, are favorable the development of young people, in to their careers. Primarily, an abundant experience in varieties of jobs enables the young to master a broad range of techniques and skills, leading to significant edge over counterparts in the competition for employment. Meanwhile, trying various roles in life and work provides wide of lifestyles for the young in the future. Only after this comparison can they realize what the real goals of their .However, other than frequent changes, the elderly who have undergone all these challenges may pursue a steady lifestyle. For the elders, concentration on their favorite activities would give rise to a sense of enjoyment and security, which is helpful to physical and psychological health. Due to a stable life, the elderly are less exposed to stress, leading to a decrease in adrenal hormones and resulting in their well-.Furthermore, degeneration of mental and physical function would make the elderly unlikely to adapt to external changes, causing and , which are not contributing to their health.Above all, it is unlikely to describe the changes in life with a positive or negative term. Accommodation for personal needs and goals is more important than the changes themselves.; To what extent do you agree or disagree? Clearly, people differ in their attitude to change. Change is part of the human condition and yet there are different opinions about it. For example, people who remain in the same job for many years are likely to build a good reputation for themselves by being reliable and loyal, which can result in career advancement and a sense of self-worth. Also, knowing what is coming can be reassuring and help people plan their lives more efficiently. This idea is not the only one, however, and there are people who argue that new experiences and challenges can lead to personal growth, a broader outlook on life and a better understanding of others. For example, a person who travels around the world and experiences different cultures may have a more comprehensive view of the world and become more tolerant of different people. They also argue that change can encourage creativity and a readiness to deal with problems, which are essential in a world that is constantly changing. And yet, being open to change does not necessarily mean being willing to give up routine, because new experiences can be incorporated within a framework that is familiar. In my opinion, it is better to strike a balance between change and continuity. One way to achieve this is to be aware of the changes that are happening around one, and to react appropriately to them, thus making the most of change without losing the comfort of the familiar. Such an attitude can enhance personal growth without sacrificing security. In the end, I think that both continuity and change are useful, and that being able to recognize when to hold on and when to let go can lead to a fulfilling life.
1423;Some people say education is the only critical factor to the development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;One the one hand good education is a highly recommended skill in the developed countries, on the other hand of many people in regions of poverty. But what makes education key factor for the development of a countryWe must acknowledge that education is something that we all need. The differences are just what we learn. Mostly the limited educational horizons of poor and less educated people have more to deal with their personal situation than with problems of bigger effects on a country. Attending school is sometimes too expensive and it does not feed a family.Nevertheless there must be a reason for education. For me it looks like some countries have realized that Education is the key for the globalization process. If we take India for example we can see that a change in the educational system had changed the economy of the country. country has changed from a poor region to a high potential for IT knowledge.In regard to this fact of education seriously and offer it to a wide range of people. Spending money education is the key tippy title=”for”]to[/tippy] a new future effects on the economy and social life. All in all I agree with the importance of education for the development of a country. Less knowledge leads to poverty and . Learning and Knowledge is Power and an investment in the near future and therefore it has to be an official task.; I agree that education is an important factor for development, but I also believe that it is not the only critical factor. Rather, a number of closely related factors, and together they are the critical factors of development. Among them, education is a very important factor. We can see from the fact that countries with high literacy and advanced education have achieved better economic development and have a higher level of health, which proves that education is an indispensable factor for development. The second is that the knowledge and skills acquired by individuals through education can be accumulated, and can play an important role in the economy, so as to create a higher level of social progress. But if education is not enough, if the administration is not in place, and the economy is still going in the wrong direction, then education is not enough, and education is not enough. For example, social equality and fairness, social justice and other cultural factors also play an important role in development. Finally, there are some basic public services such as roads, electricity, hospitals and so on, which are the basis of economic development, and without them, even the most educated person cannot realize their own value. In short, education is an important but not the only critical factor for development. In the meantime, education is an important but not the only critical factor for development. The most important thing is to combine education with other influential factors. Education is the most important, but without the three basic conditions of good governance, public security, and social equality, a country will not be able to achieve its full development.
87;Some people say free time activities for children should be organized by parents. Others say that children should be free to choose what they do in their free time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Whether parents should fully intervene in their children's organization of their leisure time or let them decide it, remains a big discussion. In this essay I will contrast the two opinions and I will explain why I think a good balance is needed.One of the reasons supporting the first view is the idea of the undeveloped children's ability to organize. This is because, although some of them might seem very mature for their age, others might struggle understanding the importance of having a routine, besides playing video games. For instance, many parents orientate their children helping them to organize hobbies and teaching a very important skill, time managment.On the other hand, some people encourage children to decide themselves what to do as this stimulates creativity and personal growth. This view, therefore, opens a new world for the little ones who can decide whatever they like, having multiple options. For example, children in this situation quite often are supported when they want to play sports or participate in a painting class.In my opinion, parents should not only be envolved as much as they can in all aspects of their children's lives, but also they might encourage the little ones to have personal opinions and decision about their hobbies and leisure actitivities. This may be a good way to build trust and communication between parents and children. Moreover, children learn responsability while being guided by their parents.In conclusion, some parents help their children more in scheduling their free time, while others intervene less leaving them to create a routine freely. I believe, parents should always be involved in their children's lives and decisions, allowing children participation too, which brings multiple benefits to their relationship.; This is a contentious issue for parents and teachers. On the one hand, some people say that parents should organize free time activities for children. They argue that well-planned activities give children a sense of structure and purpose. Parents can plan activities to promote physical and mental development. Children can learn to manage their time. They can also be involved in sports, art and other educational activities, which can not only develop their physical and mental skills, but also provide social opportunities for children to learn from each other. On the other hand, others argue that children should be free to choose what they do in their free time. This emphasizes the importance of autonomy and self-realization. Children can freely choose what they like and love, and this can lead to increased motivation and creativity. This freedom can also develop their decision-making ability and sense of responsibility. When children choose their own activities, they are more likely to develop hobbies or skills, and they are more engaged in the learning process. However, I think the best approach is a combination of both. Parents can provide some guidance and order, but children also have freedom and autonomy to explore. The most important thing is that both planned and free activities coexist harmoniously, and children have more opportunities to develop, and they are more happy.
1330;Some people say that all popular TV entertainment programmes should aim to educate viewers about important social issues. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It is often said that all influential TV entertainment programs should be geared towards raising people’s awareness about social issues that matter. While some TV programs could be suitable for this purpose, I disagree with the view that it should be mandatory for all of them, as the decision whether to do so must take into account the nature of the TV content and the channel’s audience.There is a large group of professionals who would benefit from deepening their understanding of what is happening in the world. Stock traders and bankers, for example, must always keep track of numerous business trends on a global scale, and they would appreciate this type of information on their favourite TV shows. Young people are another suitable audience due to the fact that they enjoy learning about popular topics from TV programmes. For instance, SDGs or the Sustainable Development Goals has now become an important topic to learn for children at school. Educational TV would provide a welcome alternative to textbooks, making learning more fun.Despite the potential advantages of incorporating educational content in TV programs, it is important to remember that the purpose of entertainment TV is for people to escape reality, to take a break from their hectic lives. Being reminded about some troubling social issues would not be appreciated by those who just want to unwind after a long day at work. Another consideration is how the content is perceived by the audience, because broadcasting serious topics as part of a comedy show might lead some viewers to believe they are of lesser significance. This would make TV shows of light-hearted nature a poor choice for inclusion of content on pressing social issues.In conclusion, entertainment TV programs can be an effective form of education for some people and a great tool to spread information. However, not all of them should be used for this purpose as there are various ways people appreciate them.; My opinion is that popular entertainment programmes should not only entertain, but should also try to inform the audience of the importance of certain social issues. There has been a great deal of debate about the role of popular entertainment in the public’s awareness of important social issues. In programmes like “13 Reasons Why” people have discussed mental illness and suicide prevention, and this shows the importance of television in the discussion of important social issues. Such programmes as documentaries, dramas and even comedies are a powerful way to create social awareness. This can be a useful tool, but it can also be limiting. Ultimately, the power of popular entertainment is in the relaxation and escapism it offers, but it can also create social awareness by illustrating the difficult situations people are confronted with. In conclusion, although not all programmes on television need to have an educational aspect, there is a place for those that do. People can watch popular entertainment to relax and be free of reality. But too much education can discourage people from watching and participating in the debate, which could have been useful. Entertainment is an important means of escapism and enjoyment, but popular entertainment should also have an educational aim. Balancing entertainment and education can increase social awareness, engagement and compassion.
1353;Some people say that arts subjects are as essential as academic ones and should be part of school syllabus (agree/disagree);"Some people say that art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are an essential part of education, and every school should include them in its syllabus. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your opinion and examples from your own experience.Art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are fundamentals that enrich our lives. However, some parents say schools on teaching more academic subjects, such as mathematics, science, literature and history. In my opinion, both academic and arts subjects should be taught and I will expand on the pros and cons of including arts in the school program further on in this essay.On the one hand, academic subjects are often required when we get into higher . Academic subjects may be considered as in the academic world. Personally, I have never taken an entrance exam of art subjects for high school or university. In other words, schools measured my academic abilities using academic subjects, not art subjects. To suit the current educational system, many parents in my home country, Japan, send their children to cram schools to study academic subjects deeply.On the other hand, art subjects can strengthen the creativity and flexibility of individuals. Liberal arts, which include cultural understanding and knowledge, also include other arts subjects. In addition, we are living in the era of automation and artificial intelligence which are replacing human labor and office work more and more. In this regard, human creativity becomes more important. Therefore, art subjects are being more in demand to make a difference between individuals and computers.In conclusion, academic and arts subjects should blend in a school syllabus in a balanced way. Art subjects can also a better personality in individuals, so participation in these classes should be encouraged as well as academic achievements.The writer explored the reasons why including arts subjects in school syllabus is a good idea, while fluently expressing ideas and supporting them by examples. Correct paragraphing assists with orderly presentation of information, making this essay easy to follow; the range of vocabulary is quite wide. Accuracy of expression needs a bit more attention (see corrections underlined in blue), but overall, this essay could achieve IELTS Band 8."; I firmly believe that the arts, such as music, drama and visual arts, should be given equal importance as the academic subjects. This is because the arts, such as music, drama and visual arts, have the ability to promote creativity and innovation in people. As the job market gets more and more competitive, employers are looking for employees who are not only able to perform routine tasks but also people who are able to think critically and creatively. Schools that include the arts in their curriculum can help students develop these skills early on. It is also a fact that the arts are known to develop the students’ emotional intelligence and empathy. Not only do they promote creativity, but they also teach them to express their thoughts and feelings, which are important for their personal development. Also, the arts can be therapeutic, especially during the students’ formative years. Finally, the arts are also known to help with academic performance. That is, studies have shown that students who were involved in the arts also did better in their academic subjects. This indicates that a curriculum that includes both the arts and academic subjects can produce well-rounded students who are better prepared for the complexities of today’s world. In conclusion, I strongly believe that the arts should be given equal importance as the academic subjects. The arts offer a balanced and comprehensive education that can equip the students with lifelong skills that will help them both personally and professionally.
779;Some people say that modern technology has made shopping today easier, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion;It is commonly argued that the fast pacing technology has helped people do shopping at the present time more easily. However, some people think online shopping is really difficult for them. This essay will consider both the advantages and disadvantages of the use of technology for shopping.One disadvantage of online shopping can be mentioned is that people cannot familiarize themselves with online applications for ordering essential goods and food. In fact, the elderly are not good at technology enough to go to virtual supermarkets. Besides, those who live in remote areas are not accessible easily to technology to buy online groceries.Despite its disadvantage, online shopping has brought about advantages for those who are technology natives. Firstly, it can be time-saving. In fact, shoppers can order any things they need with some clicks on the items, payment method, and time of delivery. Especially in a lingering Covid-19, when social distancing measures have been effective in some places in Viet Nam, according to a survey, the number of online shoppers has been increasing day by day, and thus many applications have been into existence, developed, and thrived.Another advantage of virtual shopping is that it can be life-saving to many people in a pandemic across nations. Going to supermarkets can be detrimental to buyers due to the spread of viruses and the higher risk of infection. For example, in order to buy bread for breakfast, people have to go out for it and thus may be exposed to infectious or incubated victims of Covid-19. Moreover, with preventive measures of Covid-19 containment, such as people not being allowed to go out for their essential goods, if they do not know how to make an online order, it is really difficult for them to survive during a pandemic.In conclusion, the use of technology for virtual shopping is beneficial to our time-saving and life-saving matters, though it is not familiar to some people. In my opinion, thanks to its advantages, I will continue to go shopping online, though the world has gone through the Covid-19 pandemic successfully.; An argument in favor of technology is that it has made shopping easier by allowing consumers to buy from home, compare prices, and have items delivered to their homes. In addition, many argue that shopping has been simplified by the introduction of various payment systems, and mobile phones, which enable consumers to shop from anywhere at any time, and in some cases have their purchases sent to their homes. There is a tendency for some to argue that technology has not made shopping easier, but rather harder. In addition, artificial intelligence is used to provide a more personal experience and make recommendations based on personal tastes and preferences. This can enhance overall consumer satisfaction. In addition, the automation and convenience provided by technology have eroded the concept of a local shopping experience and the community aspect of shopping. The vast selection of goods available in the shops can cause a decision overload and insufficient information. The advantages of shopping from home cannot be ignored, but the personal and social aspects of shopping should not be neglected either. According to critics, the convenience of home shopping can lead to the loss of social relationships and the loss of the human touch. In my opinion, although technology has made shopping easier, there must be a balance between technology and the traditional shopping experience. In the end, it is the consumers who must adapt to technology, while maintaining personal and social ties. A future that manages to combine technology and values would offer the best shopping experience.
1401;Some people say that the Internet is making the world smaller by bringing people together. To what extent do you agree that the internet is making it easier for people to communicate with one another?;In today’s world due to the advancement of technology new inventions are coming into existence. It is true that ‘Necessity is a mother of invention’. Internet is just like a wonder box, which contains every type of information. it has also proved a very important tool to connect people with one another.In today’s modernized era nobody has sufficient time to write letters to their loved ones. it also takes longer to send or receive any informationthe Internet is the easiest way to send messages to our loved ones. Communication can be either in the form of e-mail or through text messages sent via to mobile phones. We can send and receive messages straight .today’s young generation mostly prefers to do chatting through the Internet. During such chatting we can write messages and get replies straight away. voice chatting is .the advantages and disadvantages resemble two sides of one coin, also some downsides, causing people health problems poor eye-sight, back ache or migraines. Today’s teenagers usually prefer to spend their time on the internet rather than in other physical activities, which causing them to have a weaker physical health.To conclude, I would like to say that the Internet is one of the most modernized and most successful tools, not only for regarding every field in a very short period of time.; I agree with this statement to a certain extent. Firstly, the Internet allows for immediate communication. People living on the other side of the world can easily contact each other, and the distance between them seems to be much smaller. With the development of e-mail, instant messaging and social networks, people can stay in touch with each other at any time and from anywhere, so that friendships and family relationships are not affected by the distance between them. These services not only allow people to communicate with close acquaintances, but also with similar people from different countries, thereby creating a sense of community for like-minded people with different nationalities. In addition, the Internet is a democratic space, where different voices and opinions are heard. It is also a place where people are more willing to share their experiences. However, we also need to consider the disadvantages of this communication, such as the spread of cyberbullying and misinformation, and the weakening of face-to-face communication. These forms of communication can encourage people to understand each other and cooperate, which demonstrates the powerful tool the Internet can be for social cohesion. The disadvantages may outweigh the advantages, but the benefits of communication and intercultural understanding far outweigh them, and therefore the Internet’s role in connecting the world is overwhelmingly positive. In conclusion, the Internet has a great impact on people’s communication with each other, bringing people closer together and making the world feel smaller.
727;Some people say that the experiences a child has before starting school have the most influence on their future life. Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. Discuss both views and give your own opinion?;There are a lot of research about development in human life, Some people say that the experiences a child has before starting school have the most influence on their future life. Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. In the following paragraph, I will discuss both view and give my opinion.On the one hands, There has a research that bad experience in children before begining at school, especcially in family, will become unforgettable deep heart. For example, Children who live with strict parents and has aggressive punishment when children doing littie wrong things. In the future, Children will tend to aggressive and feeling they has not received a love from family. This research surely reasonnable because family is an important factor of social life.On the other hands, There have an opinion even if children was velvet glove when raised with family. However, Especially in adolescent, Friend and teacher can infleuence as same as family because teenagers spend more time at school that with family as a reason learning in classroom more than primary school and have a more group work with friend. Thus, If teenager prefer to close with a good student (not smoking or drinking alcohol / invite classroom friends travel education museum in weekends or holiday), Parents can make sure that your child will mature to standard adults.In conclusion, In my opinion, Children would be infleuenced by family before begining at school. After that, They will has a lot of complex relationship in school from friends and teachers that can infleuences children. So, Children should try to control yourself in moral to be a best quality adults.; After all, the first experiences of the child’s life set the foundations of emotional, social and intellectual development, as well as establishing the basic skills, knowledge and values that guide the person’s behavior for the rest of his life. There is much debate on this topic. Those who advocate the importance of adolescent experiences, especially in school, argue that this period is critical to the development of personal identity and social relationships. Positive experiences, such as frequent and positive interaction with caretakers, for example, can foster a secure attachment style, which has a positive correlation with the development of healthy adult relationships. On the other hand, adversity, such as abandonment or abuse, can lead to problems with self-regulation and social functioning. School, with its carefully controlled social environment, offers the perfect opportunity to learn social skills and build emotional resilience, both of which are essential to later success. During the adolescent years, people seek to find their identity, become independent, and gain social acceptance. Friendships, academic expectations and extra-curricular activities all have a strong influence on the self-esteem and self-perception of the adolescent. In addition, many of the key skills needed for adult life, such as critical thinking, problem solving and social interaction, are learned in the classroom. It is my view that childhood and adolescent experiences are equally important for the future of a person. Each has a different contribution to make, and they both highlight the importance of a supportive and nurturing environment during both childhood and adolescence. So instead of seeing these two phases as separate and unrelated, it is more useful to see them as two complementary stages of development, in which a person is formed.
337;Some people think history has nothing or little to tell us, but others think that studying the past history can help us better understand the present. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;With the development of technology, an increasing number of people try to acquire the latest technology such as computer programming, rather than to study history. There is a debate whether studying histroy could give us more advantages to understand the present society. In my opinion, obtaining knowledge of past history would be definitely helpful for us to live well in society today. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.To begin with, looking back on history would give us the opportunity to notice mistakes which human beings used to make in the past. Specifically, all kinds of people and countries around the world had made innumerable mistakes throughout history. Besides, some of these mistakes might result in a huge number of victims. Therefore, human beings must avoid these tragedic events happening again. Above all, only knowing history could lead to avoidance of the recurrences. To be more specific, World War must be one of the serious events in human being history, and understanding of this truth have a significant impact on how we should live not to cause war again in the present society. It is manifest that leaning history is meaningful in this regard.On the other hand, some arguments can be made that old stories have little something to do with our present lives. However, closer examination would reveal that all the relationships present today originally come from something in the past. Knowing history enables us to find the best way to a fruitful future. The compelling example of this is racial discrimination in the U.S. Understanding the U.S. history could give us the best manner not to deteriorate relationships in the U.S. I suppose that studying history would be helpful for all human beings from this aspect.Having considered all the arguments above, learning history would be a major contributor to a better understanding of the present because we can know how to avoid the same mistake people used to made and how we should behave for the better result through history.; In the rapid development of modern society, many people argue that there is no reason to study history, that the development of technology, science and culture will completely overshadow the lessons of the past. The debate over the role of history in today's society is not a new one. On the other hand, many people insist that history is necessary to understand the complexities of the present. The more forward-looking tend to think that history is something old and outdated, and instead of focusing on the development of the future, it should focus on the development of the present. Then, through the understanding of history, one can see the roots of today's international conflicts and help politicians to make a better decision. History can also be used to enlighten contemporary issues, providing a framework in which to understand them, so that people can make better decisions in the present. Despite the importance of progress and innovation, ignoring the past will only lead to the same mistakes being made and the inability to recognize the complexity of present situations. In my opinion, the importance of history cannot be underestimated. And to make the best use of modern technology, the best solution for individuals and societies is to combine history and progress. History not only enriches our understanding of humanity, but also gives us a guide for future development.
411;Some people think students should study the science of food and how to prepare it. Others think that school time should be used in learning important subjects. Discuss both views and give your opinion?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;These days a portion of the society consider that students must learn the subject of cooking food and ways to make meals meanwhile, a group of people think that educational institutions shall be used to study more essential courses. I strongly agree that schools should be used for learning far important subjects rather than cooking classes. In this essay a im going to examin and discuss both phenomenon viewpoints and draw my personal opinion.In one hand, some people think that cooking and food subjects should be an important courses in schools,in addition, the steps of preparing meals and information about food may help students for a healthy lifestyle.On the other hand, a group of individuals consider that cooking is a hobby and cooking classes must be optional to the student and not requiered for all students, to illustrate even more, a bigger portion of students may not be interested in cooking as others,whereas, schools must be used for more serious purposes ,for example, studying more complicated courses will have a positive effect on the students academic outcomes ,meanwhile, adding courses such as cooking might effect the students time manegement and influence their ability to focus on the important things,for further explaination, if they have a test or different assignments deadlines they should be really focusing on that rather than attending cooking classes.In conclustion, and after analysis of both penomenon i presonally believe that cooking classes should not be considered as an essential course for students in educational institutions.; There is a lot of controversy about whether the science of food and cooking skills should be part of a school’s curriculum. Proponents of food education argue that it contributes to healthier eating habits and develops independent cooking skills, while those who argue for the importance of academic subjects such as maths, science and language argue that it is essential for students to understand the importance of these subjects for their future careers and personal development. With regard to healthy eating, it is claimed that by teaching students about food and cooking, they will become more aware of their own diet and are less likely to rely on fast food. There are also arguments that if children learn the science of food, which includes nutritional values and how to cook, they will become more aware of the importance of the food they eat and they will be less likely to rely on junk food. While academic subjects are a prerequisite for higher education and for the development of career skills, but food education develops self-reliance and life skills that will be useful in the future. If these subjects are studied in a balanced way, they can acquire practical skills and still be aware of the importance of academic subjects. Maths, for example, is essential for many careers in science, technology, engineering and finance, while language develops important communication skills. In my opinion, a balanced curriculum that combines both food education and academic subjects will prepare students for a healthy and independent life. For example, when it comes to maths, there are real-world applications such as budgeting for grocery shopping, which make the classroom subject more relevant to everyday life.
59;Some people think that governments should ban dangerous sports, while others think people should have freedom to do any sports or activity. Discuss both views and give your own opinion;From the known history of the humanity, many sports or activities have been done to enjoy ourselfs, keeping in shape, or spent time. Grown up people should be free to do any kind of sports or activities by their will unless they are not hurting anyone else except theirselfs.Some people think when a citizen hurt his/herself, tax payers need to pay for the health care fees, and it should not be consern for the tax payers since they are paying only for fundamental situations. This point of view is not matching with the freedom. Yes, there might be a fee for tax payers, yet freedom should be above on all fees. While some people prefers less dangerous activities, others can be interested in more dangerous activities, as well.Governments can have some precautions to make citizens' life better. Yet, they should not involve such things like banning sports since it is the preference of the people which dealing with the dangerous sports. Some people could want to make more unique or exciting sports, and it is quite natural. Banning such kind of activities can be considered as limiting people's freedom.Since most of the people living together for a quite time in a society, people should pay respect on each others preferences, unless it is not interesting other people's personal area. As a calm and relax person, I am not intend to make dangerous sports or activities. However, I do not think that I have the right or power to say other people what should they do or not, and vice versa.; , one of which may be the opinion of the governments. Advocates of bans on dangerous sports argue that activities such as skydiving or bull riding, which are inherently dangerous and could lead to serious injuries and fatalities, not only cause pain to participants but also to the health care system. However, it is a complex issue of contrasting human freedoms and public safety. Moreover, opponents claim that the glorification of dangerous sports encourages others to take unnecessary risks, especially young people who are not yet fully aware of the dangers. According to them, governments have the duty to protect their citizens, and by regulating or banning such sports, they can minimize the risks. Opponents of the ban say that with the right training, protective equipment and informed consent, people can avoid risks and enjoy the sport. They also believe that it is in the best interest of people to have the right to choose what they enjoy and are satisfied with, even if they involve risks. As far as I am concerned, I think that governments should regulate the sports so that the rules are observed. However, this does not mean that it is forbidden altogether. Ultimately, a balanced approach that respects human freedom and the public good is the best solution to this dilemma. Awareness and education can also inform the public about the risks and precautions.
1325;Some people think that hosting an international sporting event is beneficial for a country, while others disagree. Do the advantages of hosting a major sporting event outweigh its disadvantages?;International sporting events are well-known for attracting a high level of attention because they give many people something to look forward to. Understandably, there are advantages and disadvantages for the host country, and careful consideration is required to determine whether a nation will benefit or lose from hosting a major sports championship.Worryingly, the new infrastructure required for hosting a major sporting event often comes at the expense of local people. Their lives get disrupted by construction works and at times residents have even been evicted from their homes for stadiums to be built. Worse still, practice shows the expensive, gigantic buildings constructed for the sports event aren’t being used afterwards and fall into disrepair, leaving the country with high maintenance bills. The financial burden from hosting the Olympic Games, for example, is staggering and can run into tens of billions. Still, the question remains whether or not the pros outnumber the cons.It is hard to underestimate the amount of influence on the country’s global status and prestige that comes with becoming a home to an international sporting event. New trade opportunities appear on the horizon, as it happened for many countries that hosted the Olympic Games. There is also a welcome increase in tourism, which gives the local economy a boost, injecting billions of dollars into the national budget. Construction of new stadiums, hotels and infrastructure such as new roads and rail links creates new jobs, further improving the country’s economy. Less tangible but still important is the aspect of national pride and the feel-good factor associated with hosting an international sports event.All in all, it seems to me that an international sporting event can bring more good than harm to a country, especially if its potential dangers can be avoided or minimised. Hosting a World Championship is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a country and an immense source of pride for its citizens.; According to some, they do, but others claim that the disadvantages outweigh the benefits. This essay examines both points of view and concludes that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. The London Olympic Games in 2012 raised about £2.1 billion from ticket sales alone, and created tens of thousands of jobs. Clearly, a boost to the local economy can be expected. The influx of visitors brings in additional income from hotels, restaurants, and transportation. These events also provide a sense of national pride and unity, since people can celebrate their culture and achievements. The international exposure also enhances a country’s image, which may attract future tourists and investors. It is claimed that the financial costs of hosting these events can be overwhelming. The investment in the event’s organization, the security measures, and the running of the event often lead to budget overruns, which in turn result in debts for the host city. However, critics argue that this unity is beneficial for society, since it strengthens community bonds and creates a sense of national identity. In conclusion, the costs and challenges of hosting an international sporting event are considerable, but the economic benefits, the improved international image, and the sense of national unity and pride are undeniable. It is important to make the best use of the available resources and to plan for future uses of the venues, so that the benefits outweigh the costs. Also, the long-term benefits are questionable, since many of the new venues built for the event are hardly used after it is over, which leaves the taxpayers with white elephants that take up valuable space.
575;Some people think that hosting international sports events may be beneficial for a country. Discuss both views.;Certain people believe that organizing international sports competitions could benefit host countries. While hosting sport events might also entail risks, I firmly believe that nations would gain much more than they would lose, as I will explain below.International sport competitions are usually large events that bring together thousands of people including athletes, staff, and tourists. This usually represents an attractive opportunity for local business and investors. People need to be fed, thus activating restaurants' economy. Additionally, they need a place to sleep and rest, which would benefit hotels. On the other hand, many countries hosting international competitions build new infrastructure, including stadiums, pools, public squares, and even airports. It is clear that several cities around the world have developed as a result of hosting such events. Let us take the example of the city Montreal in Canada, which hosted the olympic games a few decades ago. Organizing sports events also represents an opportunitty to improve the international image of a country. For example, it is not a secret that some countries such as Germany and Russia have used the World Cup to improve their international image, with positive results overall. Finally, since inhabitants of the host nation would feel inspired to practice a new sport, we could argue that competitions could additionally improve the health and wellbeing of citizens in the long term.It is important to mention, however, that hosting sport events might also entail some risks. These competitions are usually complex and expensive to organize, and middle- or low-income economies could better use their resources to build vital infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools. Moreover, examples around the world illustrate that some politicians see these events as an opportunity for curruption.In conclusion, there are more benefits than risks for countries when it comes to hosting international sport events. These events might translate into economic opportunities for local business and investors, could bring new infrastructure, and may trigger development.; Hosts argue that a large number of foreign visitors, for example, to the Olympic games or the World Cup, can create a large number of jobs in the hospitality and transport industries. Proponents of such events say that they can bring many benefits to a country. For example, they can bring together different people of different nations and countries and can increase their national pride. Moreover, by bringing the world's media, they can increase the country's prestige and show it to a wider audience, thus promoting the country's cultural and tourist attractions. All these factors can be a long-term benefit, since the country is better known to the world and the investment and tourism industries can be developed. On the other hand, some people argue that the costs associated with hosting international sporting events often outweigh the benefits. These international sporting events can bring a sense of belonging and enthusiasm to the population. However, the celebration of such events may take attention away from social problems, such as poverty and poor health. Preparation for these events involves a significant investment in infrastructure, security and facilities, which leads to an increase in the country's national debt. In some cases, cities are left with unused and oversized sports venues and facilities, which also means a waste of national resources. As a result, countries must carefully consider whether such costs are worth sacrificing long-term economic and social development. In my opinion, hosting international sports events may bring both economic and social benefits, but we must also consider the costs and potential negative consequences. If a country is going to host an international sports event, it should take a balanced approach and consider both the benefits and costs of the event, and avoid short-term benefits at the expense of long-term development.
1017;Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Whilie some people believe that we can live with climate change instead of dealing with that, I don't agree with this idea because climate change can bring various disadvantages for our life.There are many disadvantages of climate change which can gradually push animals and also human to extinction. First and foremost, climate change promote the process of global warming which is one of the most dangerous result of climate change. Because of this situation, ice in 2 polar areas is melting day by day. As a result, the level of sea water will go up. Therefore, countries which are near by the sea may be drown in the future. Another drawback of climate change is that it causes many disaster. The figure for disaster is predicted to increase because of climate change. Hence, people and animals will have to deal with many dangerous disaster which can bring a lot of damage.Beside, I believe there are also many way to prevent climate change. Firstly, from my perspective, education is the best way to deal with the changing of climate. Because education raises the awareness of people about how dangerous climate change is, and it also teach people to protect the environment. Therefore, the effect of climate change will decrease. Secondly, local community should hold more volunteer activity for people to clean the palace where they live, so people can make sense of environmental protection and their neighborhood will also be cleaned. This activity can also contribute to prevent climate changeIn conclusion, I believe that people can't live with climate change and people have to prevent it.; It is important to find ways to live with the consequences of climate change, but it is still necessary to prevent it as much as possible. In order to prevent climate change, it is important to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to promote sustainable practices. And the conversion to the use of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar energy, will not only reduce emissions, but also creates new economic opportunities and jobs. For example, countries such as Denmark and Germany have made great progress in the use of renewable energy sources, which shows that such measures bring immediate benefits while reducing long-term risks. The scientific community is united in its opinion that human activity is the main cause of climate change, in particular, the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. Of course, measures to adapt to climate change, such as planting drought-resistant crops or erecting barriers against rising sea levels, are undoubtedly necessary, especially in vulnerable regions. However, these measures are often costly and do not always respond to the causes of climate change. On the other hand, accepting climate change as a way of life may also lead to apathy and make it harder to respond to the crisis in a timely manner. This is why it is important to start a worldwide movement towards the development of a low-carbon economy in order to protect the environment and future generations from the devastating consequences of uncontrolled climate change. In addition, the adaptation of climate change in the world's richest countries will certainly lead to a worsening of the gap between rich and poor countries, because they have more resources and therefore can adapt to the changes more effectively. In conclusion, while planning for the future, it is important to take measures to prevent climate change and to find a way to deal with it, but at the same time it is necessary to place a higher priority on preventing and adapting to climate change. As a result, I strongly believe that the main goal should be to prevent climate change rather than just to adapt to it.
1341;Some people think that it is fine for professional athletes to misbehave on or off the field, as long as they are playing well (opinion);"Some people think that it is fine for professional sportsmen and sportswomen to misbehave on or off the field, as long as they are playing well.Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Sample EssayAlthough most professional athletes are aware of their position as role models for their fans and behave accordingly, there are sportsmen and sportswomen who behave poorly during matches and in their private life. While some people find it acceptable as long as their performance on the field is not impacted, not everyone agrees with that point of view.Those who put athletes’ performance on the field above everything else point out that competitive environment and immense pressure the sports people are under affect their behavior. They argue that athletes are entitled to privacy and their actions before and after games should not concern the general public. I find this hard to agree with, because poor behavior in sports people is incompatible with their role in public’s life and also for the reason that their actions could negatively affect their entire sports industry.The main reason why I believe athletes should behave well at all times is that their behavior is tremendously influential. Spectators respect players and many copy their actions and behavior; therefore, if top players misbehave or violate laws, some of the fans may feel compelled to follow their example and behave badly. For example, after an acclaimed baseball player was caught using drugs some years ago, the number of people who were arrested for the same crime significantly increased. This shows quite clearly why high profile players should consider their actions very carefully in order to promote a peaceful society.In addition, the behavior of athletes might affect the popularity of their sports. Some companies sponsor successful athletes who boost their brand recognition and sales of their products. Players and sports industry executives are financially compensated for endorsing products and participating in commercial advertisements. If they demonstrate poor behavior, sponsors could direct their money elsewhere, and as a result sports matches could suffer due to lack of funds. To illustrate, Sumo, a traditional Japanese sport, is held every season thanks to resources donated by companies. In a year when a Sumo player was involved in a violent crime, no matches were held, resulting in a large deficit of funds.In conclusion, I completely disagree with the opinion that top athletes are permitted to behave badly because their behavior may negatively influence the public behavior and sports industry itself.Assessor’s comment: This response addresses both sides of the argument by exploring the reasons why some people think athletes are allowed to behave poorly as long as they play well, and the reasons why others think poor behavior has no excuse. This response deserves a high score for task achievement because of that. A good range of cohesive devices is used in this essay; that and the organisation of ideas makes it easy to follow. Sentence structures are varied and the vocabulary is quite rich, the author also showed good control of grammar and spelling. It is worth noting that this sample is longer than the recommended 260 – 285 words, however, this isn’t an issue provided the author can complete an essay of this length and quality in under 40 minutes. Overall this is a good example of a Band 8 essay."; That raises serious ethical questions. Firstly, because they are role models for millions of people, especially impressionable young people. The issue of how athletes behave has received considerable attention in recent years, particularly in relation to the notion that, because of their sporting abilities, they should not be held accountable for their actions. Secondly, young people, who idolize them, can be discouraged from developing a code of conduct. When they get away with misbehavior, it creates the impression that talent can excuse bad behavior. Thirdly, athletes are not just participants in a game, they are also representatives of their teams, communities and even countries. Therefore, their behavior can have a negative impact on the public perception of the team and the country. Besides, the importance of sportsmanship and integrity in sports cannot be overestimated. There should be no place for shady behavior in sports. In a sporting competition, it is not only the skill of the athlete that counts, but also fairness, respect and discipline. The misbehavior of athletes affects the integrity of the game itself. In conclusion, although the extraordinary talent of professional athletes can captivate the public, it is essential that their behavior both on and off the field be scrutinized. By condoning the misbehavior of athletes, it can lead to a culture where success and performance are more important than ethics. This could lead to a situation where people in other fields, such as politics, business or education, think they can behave unethically as long as they achieve success. That would be a dangerous consequence. By ignoring their misbehavior, we not only undermine the athletes themselves but also the integrity of the game.
1422;Some people think that it is important to use leisure time for activities that develop the mind, such as reading and doing crossword puzzles. Others feel that it is important to give one’s mind a rest in leisure time. Discuss.;As we are human we naturally need to rest leisure time to stress of work and everyday life. In fact, every individual need to do what they want and . Personally, I prefer to be active during this time because . Moreover, people are free what they do their leisure time, and nobody can say what is the best.Some people want to relax after their day of work. These people may prefer to relax by watching movies, reading or getting a massage. People who have a such as doctors, teachers and builders may choose these types of activities. If you are a doctor, you may feel that you want to let your body rest after work and you don’t want to do a five kilometer run after work, because you are already physically tired.On the other hand, some people choose to be active in their leisure time because they do . For example, these people many spend all day sitting on a chair and their work. At the end of a working day, they a backache, and all of their body tired so they need to stretch their arms and improve their health by doing some activity such as going to the gym or swimming.To sum up, the important thing is that people want to stay healthy by choosing what is best for them. In my view, the wrong way is to stay at home in your leisure time if you have a job.;" Such a discussion shows how important leisure time is, and the two different views point out the importance of leisure time. However, for those who argue that it is important to spend leisure time on mentally stimulating activities, the benefits are not only psychological; for example, by engaging in challenging literature and puzzles, one can not only develop one’s vocabulary and reading comprehension, but also develop one’s critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Moreover, by engaging in such activities, one can establish a lifelong learning habit, making one’s mind agile and ready for any future challenges. In contrast, those who advocate for a more relaxed approach to leisure time point out the importance of mental rest; in a world where mental stimulation and continuous stimulation are the order of the day, mental rest is becoming an essential part of maintaining mental health. Furthermore, in an age where mental skills are becoming increasingly important both in the professional and personal spheres, using leisure time to exercise the mind could give a person an edge. It is often during such moments of relaxation that people experience their greatest insights and discoveries. Such as meditation, casual walking, and even just hanging around without any goal, the mind can rest and recover, and ultimately lead to greater creativity, emotional stability, and ultimately a more balanced life. At the end of the day, the best way to use leisure time is to strike a balance between these two approaches, so that people can benefit not only from challenging their minds but also from mental rest."
1215;Some people think that it is important to use leisure time for activities that improve the mind, such as reading and doing word puzzles.Other people feel that it is important to rest the mind during leisure time.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.Write at least 250 words.;Leisure period from our everyday busy schedules is absolutely a well cherished time by most people. What should exactly be done during this free time has been the subject of debate for a while. Some would argue that engaging in simple and less brain tasking activities during this time keeps the mind busy,facilitates mental alertness and sanity.While other scholars would argue that keeping the mind relaxed would improve focus and recharge the mind for when needed at work after the free period has waned off.On the one hand, it seems beneficial to engage in activities that keeps the mind slightly engaged during our leisure period. This is basically due to the fact that some mind consciousness might be lost when idle.Sluggishness may thereforeset in when required to partake in activities that requires full attention. Hence playing chess and games might help maintain ones' awareness during a less busy period. Secondly, getting involved in basic activities like reading and surfing the internet during these free period could also help improve ones intellectual capacity and also overall general knowledge that could well be very beneficial to improving the entire state of the mind.On the other hand, those who say its essential to rest the mind after extensive period of activities might have a point.This is because resting the mind will help recharge Ones' batteries and general condition of the mind. Take for instance, a Tech inclined engineer that uses his mind and brain a lot to profer solutions to complex problems. A liitle period to be calm and relaxed will be of utmost importance to alleviate a potential mind and thoughts exhaustion.In conclusion, while it seems very important and beneficial to rest the mind during leisure period to aid rebooting of the mind and brain.I strongly believe that getting involved is some innovative and creative activities during these period improves our general state of health and mind.; Both views have their advantages, and it is possible to spend free time in many different ways. Such activities can develop vocabulary, improve reasoning skills and delay the mental decline of the elderly. The National Institute on Aging has reported that people who regularly engage in mentally stimulating activities have a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. In the fast-paced world we live in, constant mental stimulation can cause fatigue and burnout. But the opposite view also has its advantages, because an active mind can make life richer by opening up new possibilities. To give an example, spending time in nature or engaging in moderate physical activity often provides a broader perspective on problems. After a break from thinking, one can often return to the tasks with a fresh mind and new ideas. Rest is therefore important, because it can make us more focused and receptive to new ideas. In my opinion, both activities have their advantages. At the end of the day, the best leisure time strategies differ from person to person, and everyone should find his or her own balance. By combining both aspects, we can develop a well-rounded approach to personal development and well-being.
865;Some people think that it is more beneficial to take part in sports which are played in teams, like football, while other people think that taking part in individual sports, like tennis or swimming, is better. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Sport play an essential role in shaping the personality of individual. Some people believe that sports which are played in teams are more beneficial like football, while others think that solo sports like tennis or swimming is better. The following essay will discuss both arguments and give my opinion that sports which are played in teams have more advantages over solo sport activites.First of all, there is no doubt that the individual sport activities enahnce people confidence. It helps building the personality and strentghen the mentality of the individuals. For examole, one role model in my home country was playing tennis table, he mentioned once in an interview, that sport helped him not only to win trophies but it raised his mental strength and shaped his pesonality.However, some people believe that, sports which are played in teamshave more advantages and all community will get the benefits. Soccer, for example, will help the players specifically the young children to understand working together and sharing the responsibility. In addition people will grow with better understanding to the concept of sharing achievements which can improve all the community. For instance, i was a member of soccer team in high school, me and my friends were taught, in order to win games we should put plans together and work as one unit. Furthermore, it helps me later in my career to understand the meaning of leadership and how the sharing responsibility and working together could bring the success to our endeavour.To conclude, solo sport can bring proud and honour to individuals butsports which played in teams teach people the meaning of working together which will improve the community in the future.; The discussion between the advantages of individual and team sports has been going on for a long time. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. People are able to determine their preferences on the basis of their own experiences. The competition in team sports can make a person feel that he can reach his limits and achieve something. This is an important lesson that he can only learn from a supportive group. Team sports require participation, cooperation and good communication, which teaches people important social skills such as leadership, negotiating and getting along with people. This kind of cooperation is not possible in individual sports. The competition in individual sports requires more personal effort and self-reliance, and there is more emphasis on self-discipline and perseverance. Individual sports like tennis and swimming have other advantages. In my opinion, individual and team sports are both good and bad, and in the end the choice is determined by personal preferences and goals. People who love teamwork will find that team sports can develop social skills and a strong support system. People who like to work alone can feel the independence and freedom of individual sports. In any case, whether it is team sports or individual sports, it is very beneficial for people's health, mental well-being and general happiness.
765;Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children’s development than playing computer games. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Some individuals believe that playing outside has a more positive effect on children's development rather than playing computer games. I share the idea that being involved in outdoor activities is more beneficial than playing computer games.Active development is the main reason for including outdoor activities in children's life. All people know that the development of children is an extremely significant part of building a personality. To do so parents should try to involve their children in exploring local insects, animals or playing different games such as football, riding bicycles, and many other. This will only expand the knowledge of children, and consequently have a positive effect on their development. This is also important to have a healthy generation in the future. Parents can join their children or they can find some friends around and also be socially active. For example, a father can teach his son how to bicycle or how to take care of plants and trees.The next important reason for doing more outdoor activities for children is avoiding physical problems, which can cause computer games. Currently, a lot of people including children suffer from different side effects of a lazy lifestyle and obesity can exemplify it. To avoid problems with physical health in the future, spending a couple of hours should be recommended to all children.Of course, little time spent playing computer games will not hurt children, but it is important to limit it. To sum up, children should do more outdoor activities and play computer games less.; I mostly agree with this opinion. Firstly, outdoor activities provide children with essential physical benefits. To play outside or do some sports is to maintain good health and fitness, which is necessary for healthy development. In addition, outdoor activities help develop leadership and communication skills, which can be developed when children are playing with other children in group sports, while the solitary nature of playing with the keyboard prevents children from developing social skills. Outdoor activities also stimulate children’s creativity and imagination, as well as develop problem-solving skills, because they expose them to real life experiences and encourage them to solve problems in unpredictable ways. For example, when children build forts or explore nature, they learn to think creatively, which is an important skill for their future lives. On the other hand, although playing with the keyboard can also develop some mental abilities, such as hand-eye coordination and quick decision-making, they lack the physical and social engagement that outdoor activities have. In addition, too much screen time can lead to health problems such as obesity, sedentary behavior and depression. Some games can be educational and helpful, but they cannot replace the wholesome benefits of outdoor activities. However, of course, everything is good if used properly. If children are encouraged to spend more time outside, they can not only maintain good health and fitness, but also enrich their social and mental skills, thus laying a good foundation for their future development. In conclusion, although both outdoor activities and keyboard games have their own advantages, outdoor activities are much more conducive to the overall development of children.
613;Some people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;It is often argued out there about sports, debating about both physcial and mental strengths and which is far more crucial to the success. This essay will go over these two points of view in further depth and outline some expamples, where relevant, for each.On one side, some people think that the most important factor to succeeding in sports is the physical strength. Body strength is actually quite indispensable in any sport activity, especially those types of sports that demand a high fitness level and high physical endurance, etc, such as MMA fights, wrestling, football, and so on. All of these require an elevated and advanced charachterestics of one's body. For example, an athlete can not keep up a football match and running around for 90 minutes without a high body endurance, fitness, so on and so forth.On the other hand, the others believe that a powerful mentality and mindset are needed for such success and accomplishment. That is, they believe that one's attitude is the first key to success before anything else. People need to have some sort of a mindset with specific qualities, such as perseverance, determination, concentration, etc. and it's not always about havign a massive body strength. For example, some MMA athletes step in the ring with solid bodies, will not always win the games if they're not determined and persistent already, altought their opponents do not have that huge bodies. It's all about the mindset.In conclusion, it's not easy to decide which of these two criteria is more important than the other. However, I believe that any athlete must have these two, train them both before getting into any challenge, no matter what type of activity. An athlete must have a strong body and a trained attitude once and for all.; If you are going to be a successful sportsman, you need to have mental strength as well as physical strength. Some sports, such as weightlifting, running, and football, seem to rely more on physical strength to achieve success. Physical strength and mental strength have long been a subject of debate in the world of sports. But it is not always easy to get rid of the old concept that mental strength is more important than physical strength. In the case of football, for example, the ability to withstand physical attacks and to show force can make the difference between winning and losing. Many athletes with exceptional physical strength have a certain advantage over their competitors, and they are able to push themselves to the limit and show better performance than their competitors. But, on the other hand, if you are a tennis player or a marathon runner, you need to be able to keep calm and not get tired in a long game. A sportsman with good mental strength can overcome mental fatigue, overcome anxiety and setbacks. Physical strength usually attracts attention because it helps athletes to execute their skills quickly. Mental strength, however, is also important for making quick decisions, adjusting strategies, and adjusting to the ups and downs of a competition. In my opinion, both physical strength and mental strength are necessary for a successful sportsman. There is a synergy between mental strength and physical strength. It is the physical strength that allows an athlete to succeed, but it is difficult for an athlete to succeed without mental strength. But even athletes with good mental strength can be defeated by external pressure and setbacks. It is a matter of finding the right balance between the two in order to succeed in sports.
1349;Some people think that public health in a country can be improved by government making laws regarding nutritious food (agree/disagree).;Some people think that public health within a country can be improved by government making laws regarding nutritious food. Others, however, think that health is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Personal and public health are tightly related to food choices. While some people believe that the government should regulate nutrition to improve public wellness, others argue that it should be people’s decision whether to pursue a healthy diet or not. This essay will discuss both points of view and explain why the authorities should not control the types of food people can buy.Legislators could impose laws concerning nutritious food in an effort to have a healthier population, public health costs. Even if this could be considered a good idea, it would be very quite difficult to implement. To achieve this target, the rulers could impose a levy on unhealthy food options, or reduce their availability on the grocery stores shelves. In Italy, for example, products such as carbonated sugary drinks and chips are heavily taxed. As a result, the sales of these items have decreased. However, if the authorities start to take control of what their citizens can or cannot eat, it may be seen as limitation of freedom.Since personal freedom is an extremely important human right, many people think that they should be responsible for their choices regarding the food and drinks they decide to consume. I agree with this opinion because limiting nutritional options, even if it is done with the best outcome in mind, could consequently create dissatisfaction among the population, which would possibly lead to other public issues such as protests and demonstrations. A better approach could be educating the public about a healthy diet, which would help people make better-informed decisions about the food they consume. Many developed countries around the world employed this strategy and saw public health gains.In conclusion, even though the government is able to control the dietary habits of its population through taxation and restrictions, healthier citizens and reduced public health expenses isn’t the only possible outcome. Limiting personal freedom could result in social unrest and for that reason diet decisions are better to be left up to well-informed individuals.This response achieved the task requirements by discussing whether the government or individuals should be in control of their diet. The ideas are developed and supported by examples, the information is organised in paragraphs, and coherence is maintained throughout the essay. A range of sentences structures and advanced vocabulary is used in this work. Overall, it seems worthy of IELTS Band 8+.; Such regulations can, I believe, be of great benefit to public health. Public health is a difficult challenge to many societies, and governments are often debated on their role in the health of a nation. Government regulations can, for example, inculcate the population with the importance of nutrition by regulating the food people eat. By establishing guidelines that encourage people to eat healthy food, governments can, over time, change the people's eating habits and thereby encourage a culture of health. There are also obvious advantages to such regulations: first, governments can help to level the food situation in low-income areas, where there is often less opportunity to buy nutritious food and thus a higher risk of obesity and diabetes. By, for example, subsidizing the sale of vegetables and fruits and setting up regulations for the sale of food in schools, governments can level the field and thereby help to promote public health. Regulating the sale of food in schools also means that children have better access to healthy food, and regulations that restrict the advertising of high-fat, low-nutrition foods can thus make them less tempting and thereby encourage healthier eating from an early age. Secondly, such regulations can prevent unhealthy food from being marketed to vulnerable groups such as children. It is my firm belief that government regulations relating to healthy food can be an important tool in improving public health. By encouraging a greater awareness, leveling the food situation in low-income areas and regulating advertising, governments can make the population as a whole eat healthier food and thereby prevent obesity and related diseases and promote the population's health. Long-term, such measures can affect public health by reducing the risk of long-term, chronic illnesses.
1386;Some people think that students who don’t take a break in studies between the high school and the university are at disadvantage compared to students who travel and work after high school before further continuing their education. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, in our competitive world, to succeed, knowledge from school and university is not enough. Therefore, students who study from the school to university get fewer benefits and contribute less too, compared to those who travel or work and get experience and skills . There are two following reasons to support for my opinion. I refer to the group of people who study from school to university as ‘group A’ and the other group – as ‘group B’.Firstly, at school and university, what group A gains is almost entirely theory, theory and theory. Of course, theory is very , however, you can’t do everything with just theory. You must have experience. This is what group A . Although in the third or fourth year at university, group A can be apprentices in some companies, to help them approach their future jobs, they aren’t trained well because of the short time spent working. And the real job is still very strange to them. After graduating, without experience, group A students can’t accomplish their work perfectly. On the other hand, it takes them time and money to keep up with other experienced students and they may be scorned. Therefore, group A students can contribute less than group B who have the two most important things: skills and experience.Secondly, as group A students are contributing less, they surely get less benefit. Moreover, many companies which employ people in group A have to train them from ground-up. These companies take this cost from group A’s salary to reduce the risk of their employees leaving to other companies after being trained. So, less benefits are unavoidable and certain, group B members are more loyal and effective workers. They also have useful experience and skills. Besides, their education is the same as or even higher than that of group A. As the result, group B gets more benefits absolutely.In conclusion, I think a student should travel or work before going to the university. That way, not only will they have basic knowledge but also skills and experience which are useful for them to get a good job and have a brilliant future.; To begin with, some students who take a break and travel or work gain practical experience and can develop a deeper understanding of the world. On the other hand, others think that uninterrupted education is more advantageous. Students who go on to university after working or travelling may find their desire to study is strengthened and they can return with a clearer understanding of their chosen field of study. They may also be more aware of their career goals and more informed when they choose their course of study and career path. However, students who continue their studies directly from high school may have a natural advantage, as they have not interrupted their education. This can be an advantage because they have retained their focus on the university environment, and this can be beneficial to their future studies. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, but I think the students who take a break and work or travel are better prepared for university and for life after university.
1281;Some people think that the most important thing about being rich is it gives a person the opportunity to help other people.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Helping other people in society is noble goal ,to some people it's a big achievement .However rebuilding personality of individuals and giving them an opportunity to leave an influence in the community is reflecting the genuien humanity .Therefore i agree with notion that rich people who are, in fact have the ability to offer the help for orthers in order to recreate healthy environment for everbody to work in our society .The following essay will illuminate the reason behind my opinion .Regrettably . many people suffer form disadvantages situtaions nowdays like losing jobs or money ,they find themselves have no energy or motive to contiune and to help their families . As a result of that poverty propagates in some society and usually accompany with low level availability of education . Hence to avoid falling into misery, some countries nowdays help non governmenrtal organizations and institutions to give assist to poor communities in a manner to raise education and develop health sector. For instance , Red Cross and Save the children , both organizations offere help and leverage human rebuild personality which no doubt will enrich these communities with several benefits .In spite of green vevet picture that mentioned above , some people think that helping people alone is not enough . However , others believe that no matter how grim or daunting things may seem , if the individual have the courage to move a head , then everything is possible . Nevertheless people can find the motive inside eventhoughlife handed them a toughest time . For example Helen Keller .An American Author , although she born with disability but she could be one of greatest authors in western history .In summary , no doubt that people should have the courage to move a head whether they find help from others or not . However people who can offer the help will make our community live peacefully and bring prosperity to our offsprings .; First of all, being rich gives people the opportunity to help their fellow human beings. Some people say that it is their duty to help those in need, while others believe that being rich has no other value than that it makes them feel happy and that they can influence the community in which they live. These people who have the opportunity to help others in need with the money they have earned, are therefore fulfilling their duty. There are, for example, Bill and Melinda Gates, who have used their wealth to improve the health of the world and to educate people, which has led to the eradication of many diseases and to an increase in literacy around the world. It is also true that many rich people earn their money through innovation, invention or entrepreneurship, and their personal goals and aspirations are important to them. For example, Elon Musk has not just wanted to make a lot of money but has also wanted to push technological development forward and to help solve the problems of the world, such as the climate through the use of electric cars and the colonization of space. So it is not surprising that many of these people are completely happy with their wealth and the knowledge that they have the opportunity to help others. Moreover, one can achieve financial freedom and security, which makes it possible to choose one's own goals and aspirations. In this sense, one can find personal self-fulfillment and passion and through that achieve social improvements without thinking of philanthropy. Wealth is a powerful tool that can contribute to the fulfillment of individual needs and social improvements. In conclusion, although for many people it is important to be able to help others with their wealth, it is also important to see that wealth gives one the opportunity to develop personally, to help others and to contribute to social development.
1081;Some people think that there should be strict laws to control the amount of noise a person makes because of the disturbance it causes to people.Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;With the increasing population in cities,noise pollution has been one of the important causes of concern.This essay presents the advantages and disadvantages of the strict laws that are made to control noise pollution.Noise pollution affects different groups of people in various ways.The increasing noise in recent days has led to increasing problems of hearing impairment in people in today's society.Also,the noise pollution has a devastating affects on the heart patients and it has been affecting people who are working and studying in various ways.By implementing strict rules like imposing heavy fines on vehicles honking unnecessarily and filing a case on the noise caused by the public gatherings like rallies,the above problems can be addressed.For example, recent studies have shown that the cities having less noise pollution have been leading better life when compared to those with noise pollution.However,implementing strict laws on noise caused by a person also has some disadvantages.Firstly,different religions have different kinds of festivals which cause a lot of noise.For instance,diwali,one of the most celebrated festivals in India,is celebrated by firing crackers causing a lot of noise is affected by implementing these laws.Secondly,most of the people with religious beliefs will have a bad impact by these rules.To give an example,the prayers in masjids are made with loud noise so that it can reach a large group of people living in the area.To conclude,implemeting strict rules like fines and filing a case on the people causing noise pollution have a good impact on the health of the society and increasing the efficiency of work where as the festivals and the religious centres have a negative impact by these laws.; Among the main advantages of the implementation of such laws, it is good for public health. In general, noise pollution is a major problem in urban areas, which is why people have long been discussing the need for strict noise laws. But there are also disadvantages of such laws. With a clear view of the fact that a large number of cities with noise limits can lower the number of noise-related complaints, so that the peacefulness of the city increases. Noise pollution has a significant negative effect on health, stress, sleep disturbance, the development of blood vessels, and therefore the quality of life is improved. Also, in the event that there are some schools in the area of the city that are located in noisy areas, it is not always possible to provide a quiet and comfortable learning environment, and so on. Therefore, the educational institutions and hospitals should be protected from such noise. Children, the elderly, people with disabilities should also be protected from the harmful effects of noise. There are many disputes about what is too much noise. For example, a musician who practices in his house may consider this a need for his work, while his neighbors consider it a disturbance. Secondly, there is a significant burden on the local administration of resources to control noise, which can lead to a decrease in the quality of life of the population. Thirdly, if the benefits of noise laws are achieved, such as public health, protection of vulnerable groups of the population, the quality of life of the population, a balance between individual freedom and social well-being must be achieved in order to create a harmonious environment for all people.
1431;Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than with a teacher. Others think that it is always better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.;It is certainly said that learning is an ongoing process .Every person something new their age, experience, knowledge and education. According to my point of view it is always better to have teacher or guide for study.One teacher has adequate knowledge to teach their student. knows ways to make subject easier for the students, moreover, he teaches them in an effective manner. For example, some students are weak in some subjects but a teacher them according to their mental capacity. . Some people can learn better in the topics with others. In class people can the views of others, . .In the today’s competitive world, everybody is busy, some people think that their time classes they can learn better their subject . They can attend online classes by using the Internet at home. They can get relevant information from the Internet regarding their topic. There is specific time or age limit to learn something new. Some new things we can only learn from experience – for example new facts, new habits and so on., I would like to say that it is always better for the people to have a teacher because a teacher has good knowledge, experience and is educated how to teach others. People will learn from a teacher in an easier way rather than on their own.; The main advantage of learning with a teacher is the orderly and disciplined environment. While self-study and studying with a teacher have their advantages, I believe that self-study does not provide the guidance, direction and social interaction of a teacher. The self-study students often cannot find the right path for themselves and miss many important concepts. It is important for self-study in complex subjects like math or science to have a solid foundation. The interactive environment of the classroom can provide instant feedback, clear misunderstandings, and encourage students. In addition, teachers not only teach, but also serve as motivational figures. Their presence encourages students to study hard. Social interaction is another important aspect of learning, which is usually richer in a classroom setting. Students who work together in a group discussion will have a deeper understanding of the subject and see the learning process from different perspectives. If you don't have a teacher, you may lose your interest and you may not get any guidance to clear your misunderstanding. Self-study can promote the development of personal discipline, but the advantages of teachers cannot be ignored, and the structure, guidance, and social interaction they provide can also help students learn comprehensively and develop their personal abilities. On the contrary, self-study often leads to isolation, which reduces the opportunity to discuss and exchange ideas. Self-study will not have the momentum of learning in a group. I strongly support the traditional learning method of studying with a teacher.
693;Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Space, so unknown for the humankind that it generates so much curiosity among experts and enterprenues. Due to this curiosity, the amount of resources and money invested in its exploration is surprisingly big. Developing technology for it is expensive but, in my humble opinion, completly justified.Firstly, developing technology is vital so that space exploration can be carried out succesfully. Experts have discovered that we only know a 4 percent of the entire universe. If with only that 4 percent we have accomplished amazing achievements, imagine what the human race could do when knowing a 10 percent.Secondly, space exploration and the technology involve on it not only will help the human race understand the universe but also will provide a whole new kind of tourism, space tourism. The CEOs of some of the most profitable business in America are investigating this possibility. The leading enterprises in this sector are Blue Origin from Jeff Bezos and Space X from Elon Musk. When discovered the way of sending people to space safely, space tourism will generate twice the money spent on technology for space exploration.In a nutshell, space exploration is crutial for the development of the human race. Furthermore, if this was not enough, all the technology developed will serve the purpose of creating a whole new kind of tourism that will generate billions of dollars in revenue. From my point of view, even though here on earth there are several problems to be solve with money, our future lies on space, so be must spend as much money as possible.; It seems to me that the world's most important problems, such as poverty, health, education, are more important than space exploration. However, if we allow these issues to be the most important, we can see that the investment in space exploration brings significant benefits that extend far beyond our curiosity about outer space. But above all, space exploration has contributed to the development of many of the most important technologies that are now a part of everyday life. For example, the development of satellites, the development of global positioning systems, the development of medical devices such as CAT scans. In addition, international cooperation in the field of space exploration has led to the creation of a close relationship between the states, and in turn, has helped to build peace and mutual understanding between them. In this way, money spent on space exploration indirectly contributes to solving other problems. The challenges of addressing climate change and cosmic threats require us to know the universe better, to monitor the changes in the environment and even to protect us from cosmic hazards. In a world that is increasingly polarized, the search for knowledge outside the planet offers a unique opportunity for unity. Therefore, I believe that the funds spent on developing technology for space exploration are justified and necessary for the future. In conclusion, although I recognize the need to address the most urgent human problems, I believe that space exploration is a multi-faceted investment that contributes to the development of technology, international cooperation and the ability to cope with existential challenges.
1309;Some people today believe that it is acceptable to use physical force to discipline children, but others feel it is completely unacceptable.Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Punishing children with physical force, or corporal punishment as it is also called, is something that was accepted not so long ago and people over the age of forty may well remember it. Nowadays, however, corporal punishment is against the law in most countries and adults who practise it can be taken to court. Children are always a vulnerable group and they depend on adults for protection and education. Of course, part of the growing up process is testing and breaking boundaries and it is nearly always necessary to instill discipline on a child. Whether or not it is necessary to use physical force to do so can be a very emotive subject.Supporters of corporal punishment often defend their standpoint by explaining that the corporal punishment is not, or should not be, excessive. They do not argue that a child should be beaten severely until he or she is bruised or cut. They argue that just the infliction of mild pain causes effective discipline and also the fear that it might be applied. People who grew up experiencing it might offer this point of view.Those who oppose using physical force on a child would say that the vulnerability and innocence of a child means that force should never be used. Children need to trust adults and believe that no harm will come to them. Additionally, children learn from adults and it is argued that corporal punishment will only teach children that force is an answer to various problems. It is also claimed that corporal punishment has no added benefits over other forms of discipline that do not require physical force. Using it can cause psychological harm to children and should be classed as child abuse.Personally, I do not believe that limited use of forms of corporal punishment can cause harm, and a parent who administers a mild form of it to his or her child should not be subject to criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, I would not use it myself. I can also recognise the possibilities of adults who are not a child’s parents misusing corporal punishment. Therefore, I believe that on balance physical force to discipline children should not be permitted.; The proponents of physical punishment argue that it can be a direct way to prevent unwanted behavior. Some believe that physical punishment is a good way to respect the parent-child relationship, while others are concerned that there are psychological and emotional risks that can outweigh any positive effects. A quick slap or a similar form of physical punishment, they say, can bring immediate compliance, and enforce order and respect. However, such arguments usually ignore the long-term effects of physical force on the child's psychological and social development. They often refer to the historical, traditional and cultural practices that have been part of many societies for centuries. Physical punishment also leads to a decrease in parent-child understanding and trust, which can have a negative effect on the parent-child relationship. Proponents of physical punishment emphasize the fact that studies have shown that slapping and similar practices lead to an increase in the risk of psychological disorders in children, and the child may grow up to be more violent. I believe that physical force should never be used as a form of discipline, because the dangers to a child's emotional health and their future behavior outweigh the short-term positive results. Instead, the positive consequences of positive methods, such as discipline, time-out and reward, result in better behavior and a healthier emotional development. In today's society, it is important to cultivate a sense of understanding and emotional intelligence, and it starts with the rejection of outdated and harmful forms of discipline. Instead, parents and guardians can guide their children effectively through positive and alternative means, which strengthen the relationship and foster the child's respectful behavior, without reverting to violence.
1358;Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems, is this a positive or negative development?;Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems. Is it a positive or negative development? Give your own opinion and examples from your experience.At present, the Internet plays a vital role in almost every aspect of human life. As a result, individuals are searching online reasonable solutions to their illnesses. Not everyone is convinced that access to such information online is safe and helpful. However, in my view, providing the general public with access to trustworthy information about medical disorders would invariably improve the quality of the medical care for the whole society.Nowadays, even though there are plenty of online platforms developed for medical education, most of the sites have not been written by professional healthcare providers. Hence, there is a high possibility of spreading wrong medical information throughout the world, unless the site developers are held accountable for the content they provide. If patients receive incorrect information about a medical procedure and follow the wrong advice, for instance, to remove a wart at home, it might lead to a serious infection, excessive bleeding or another medical emergency. That would constitute a negative effect of using online knowledge for medical treatments at home rather than visiting a professional.On the flip side, the Internet, the society is well aware of most common medical disorders and preventive measures. Consequently, a reasonable and prudent individual can decide whether to get professional opinion on one’s disease or to handle it at home, that they get reliable online medical information. Moreover, if patients can manage mild medical problems themselves, it would certainly reduce the workload at the local hospitals, freeing more doctors for patients in real need. Besides, if patients come with a certain extent of knowledge about their condition to the medical consultation, it would invariably be helpful to the medical practitioner for effective decision making.To sum up, it is evident that online search for information on medical disorders can be a positive development as long as the general public receives trustworthy information.This response addresses the topic well. The writer’s position is clearly explained and supported, the information is organised in paragraphs in an easy to follow way, and use of linking words is appropriate. A range of complex sentence forms is used and there are very few errors in word choice or word formation (underlined in blue). Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.; But there is a tendency to benefit more than harm from this development, as long as you take it with responsibility and common sense. People can become familiar with their symptoms, possible diagnoses and possible treatment options before they talk to a health care professional. This gives the person an increased power to a part of the decision making about their health. The information from many credible health-related sites and portals is based on scientific research and can therefore be considered as an alternative to relying on the doctors' experience alone. Patients who have done their own research can, for example, have a more informed and active dialogue with their doctors, ask informed questions and discuss possible treatment plans, rather than passively receiving prescriptions. However, there are risks in self-diagnosis and too much reliance on the Internet for health information. It can quickly lead to erroneous alarms or erroneous treatments. Therefore, the democratization of health information can lead to increased health literacy in society. While the Internet is full of both credible and questionable health information, people who use it for health solutions can often benefit from a greater understanding and dialogue with their health care professionals. The Internet can also make people forget the importance of the doctor's opinion and delay the care they need, which can also have harmful consequences.
949;Some say that because many people are living much longer, the age at which people retire from work should be raised considerably.To what extent do you agree or disagree?;People nowadays are living much longer.With the discovering of new medicine and with the innovation in the medical field, the life expectancy of a person skyrocketed over the last decade.Some people might think that the consequence of this phenomenon should be the fact that the age at which people retire from work ought to be raised considerably.I don't agree with this idea.Rather than involving the life expectancy of a person, we should consider the job itself.Is it tiring? Does it require a person to be able to react immediately to a potential problem?If the job is tiring I think that it would be better for a person to retire. If you end up being worn out every day because your job is very exhausting the life expectancy should not be the fact that decides if you have or not the right to retire.The question ought to be: Is the person physically and mentally able to cope with the work?The older you get the slower you become. This is another pivotal factor that should be taken into account when deciding the retirement age of a person.The ability to react to dangerous events keeps the working environment under control.Let's imagine a carpenter working on the construction of a new building.What if a wall suddenly falls? Does an elderly person react faster than a younger worker?I am an optimistic person but I would stick to my guns in this scenario betting on the younger person.I would like to wrap up this essay by saying that I could have thought of many more reasons that explain why the age at which people retire from work should not be based entirely on the fact that people are living longer.Of course, this can not be ignored but basing this decision only on this fact it is seen by me as a poor approach.; Proponents of a higher retirement age usually argue that it would improve the long-term viability of the pension system. However, while some argue that the extension of the retirement age is a logical response to the increase in life expectancy, others argue that the relationship between life expectancy and the needs of people and society should be balanced. As the average retirement age increases, more people contribute to the workforce and pension funds, and governments and taxpayers save money. In countries where the population is ageing, it seems particularly important. Not all jobs are suitable for extended work. Some of the jobs that require a lot of physical strength may not be sustainable for people in their seventies and may have a negative effect on their health and performance. One of the dangers of raising the retirement age is that it neglects personal choice and quality of life. It is better to let people decide when to retire based on their health, financial situation and goals. In addition, many older workers are looking forward to retirement, which allows them to enjoy their last years, rather than be forced to work longer than they want. In conclusion, while there are strong economic reasons for raising the retirement age due to longer life expectancy, the issue should also take into account the well-being and preferences of the workforce. Instead of a single increase in the retirement age, governments should consider different retirement models to meet the needs of different workers.
1389;Some say that the Internet is making the world smaller by bringing people together. To what extent do to you agree that the Internet is making it easier for people to communicate with one another?;"A global village, that is certainly what the world feels like nowadays. With the help of the , you can reach out and get to know people you might never have met in person. Articles can be co-authored, business deals can be finalized, degrees can be earned and at times even medical advice can be given- and all of this is just a click away.Electronic mail, instant messages, web cameras and microphones; all these gadgets and programs make the presence of the other person more real. Who knows; with the help of visual reality you might even get a 3-D image of the speaker! I believe that the Internet is one the best inventions of the last century, you can hardly get to miss anyone and nobody is really out of reach. You can keep in touch with your friends, and be able to do your work from your bedroom in your pajamas!However, the internet can also be a major source of harassment. Spammers and hackers can invade your privacy and get personal/confidential information, which otherwise they never get access to. You are never out of anybody’s reach, unless you make a conscious decision of not checking your email, there can be always more work waiting for you in your inbox and you might never have a moment to yourself. Worse yet, if you were a workaholic, you might never experience that stress-free vacation ever again in your life – simply, because you have your mobile workplace with you at all times.As a romantic, I will always look forward to getting an occasional letter in the snail mail. A personal letter, where I can sense the mood of the writer by the slants in his/her handwriting and get to know him/her better. But as a type A personality person, the internet gives me all what I dream of in terms of communication – the speed, reliability, and convenience of time and place. I can certainly tolerate its shortcomings any day, as long as it keeps me close to my loved ones."; I agree with this statement in many ways, as the Internet has made it easier for people to communicate with each other in both a professional and social sense. First, the Internet has provided numerous platforms for real-time communication, which has enabled people to establish close and fruitful business and personal relationships. This increased availability has both enhanced existing relationships and created new ones, including cross-cultural friendships that would not have been possible before the Internet era. Social media platforms, instant messengers and video conferencing applications enable people to connect instantly, no matter where they are located in the world. With just a few clicks, friends and family who are separated by oceans can share their experiences and experiences with each other, reducing their loneliness and strengthening their bonds. And this democratization of access has brought people from different backgrounds together in dialogue, allowing them to work together on common interests and enriching the whole community. Moreover, the Internet offers a wealth of information and resources that can help people overcome communication barriers. For example, the language barrier, which has been a major obstacle for communication between people from different countries and regions, is being overcome by language translators. People can find answers to the most complex questions by searching for them, and learning about new ideas, inventions and discoveries has become much easier because of the Internet. Nevertheless, it is important to realize that the Internet has expanded communication opportunities, but it has also presented new challenges. For example, the spread of misinformation and the development of cyberbullying and echo chambers can complicate and prevent honest communication and genuine interaction. The increased availability of communication creates a greater sense of compassion and understanding for different cultures, making it easier for people to become a world citizen. So, despite its numerous benefits, the Internet should be used wisely and consciously to fully benefit from its potential. In conclusion, the Internet is an important tool for making the world feel smaller by making communication easier between people of different backgrounds.
655;Some systems require students to specialize in a limited range of subjects from the age of fifteen. Other systems require students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?;"Education programs are different from one area to another area, there are systems that learners are required to choose restricted number of courses for their academic curriculum by the age of 15.while,other educational systems ask students to take comprehensive courses until they graduate from school. There are many positives for both trends, in my opinion limited range of academic subjects education system is better.On the one hand, it is basic knowledge to accept the idea that pupils who study selected number of subjects from age of fifteen are more informative academically in specified field of study. For example, when student decide to take medical subjects from early age the student will be prepared by tutors completely for the nominated curriculum,as a result all the student's focus will be on medical topics thus, the student is more qualified to practice medicine more efficiently after school graduation.Furthermore, this system will build a solid knowledge background in limited range of subjects can help to develop creativity at early age.Moreover, in the financial view point it may be better for students to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15; selected number of academic subjects means less money allocated for educational services by guardians.On the other hand, it is true to claim that general subjects system can prepare students to be more informative in various different live aspects. Since, students who register with wide range subjects system can gain academic knowledge and support in fields such as mathematics,physics,medicine,and....ect. Therefore,those students can select more than one speciality to practice as a professionalism in future.Besides, wide range system help to improve social interactions better,because friends will not be separated and they continue school education together until graduation,inaddition there is chance to make more friends as primises are more crowded.To sum up, educational systems main target is to develop and progress academic background of students.But, in my opinion,it is better to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15 due to reasons like: solid academic background in specific field,creativity,and less financial burden on parents."; Both systems have their advantages and disadvantages, and each system suits different learning styles and career goals. The debate about specialization and generalization in education at the age of fifteen is an important one that shows the different educational systems in the world. Those who are more interested in their career can take early action and start studying early, and those who have clear career goals can achieve a better result without the distraction of other subjects. After fifteen, students can focus on learning specific subjects, such as science, art or technical skills, so that they can achieve a deep understanding and deep knowledge in their chosen areas, which can also help prepare them for higher education or direct employment. The teaching of a wide range of subjects also cultivates the students' creativity and innovation, and they are able to use the concepts of different disciplines to combine their own thinking and imagination. On the other hand, general education until graduation can cultivate the students' comprehensive strength, intellectual openness, thinking ability and problem-solving ability. The choice of which system is better is based on the needs of individual students and the needs of the community. In the face of the increasingly severe competition for jobs, students with more general education are more able to adapt to the changes in the market. In short, both systems have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the most beneficial way is to establish a flexible system that can meet the needs of the times. For example, the system in which the students learn a wide range of subjects until the age of fifteen, and then choose to learn a few subjects, may be able to meet the needs of both depth and width.
1347;Some think that children should leave their family home as soon as possible while others believe they should stay for as long as they like (discuss);Some people think that it is best to encourage children to leave their family home as soon as possible. Others believe children should stay at the family home for as long as they like. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayAlthough it is thought by some that urging young people to abandon their family home at an early age is beneficial for them, others believe that it is better if children stay with their families for longer. In my opinion, leaving family home early has many advantages for children.On the one people think that youngsters ought to leave their parents’ house so as to learn life skills at an early age. Their reasoning is that it should push young people towards independence and make them learn from life lessons rather than merely rely on their parents. For example, students who pursue tertiary study away from their home city might learn taking personal responsibility. Also, living independently will teach children a lot by presenting some difficulties, which, consequently, will add some more experience that may prove essential in their future lives.On the other hand, it is argued that children should stay with their parents for longer for several reasons. Firstly, young people need advice from adults, and no one would be better suited to that than their parents. Secondly, life can be generally harsh, for children in particular. In other words, they might or take unnecessary risks if they mix with the wrong crowd. It is commonly known that young people tend to be by unethical people. To avoid that, being under parental supervision is utterly important for children.To sum up, while people’s opinions may vary, I believe that young people should leave their family home at an early age, while parents ought to provide them with appropriate advice and keep an eye on their well-being.This essay covers the task by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of leaving the family home early in life, and the writer’s opinion has been clearly stated. The arguments for and against have been organised in paragraphs and supported by examples. Accuracy of expression needs some work (see suggested corrections underlined in blue) and in one case sentence structure needs more attention. Overall, assuming the errors were corrected, this essay could score Band 8 in IELTS.; The people who are in favor of early independence believe that when a person leaves home he will be more independent and will develop his personality. On the other hand, those who advocate staying at home longer argue that this is the time for children to learn more important life lessons. Supporters of this idea argue that early independence can help children deal with the problems of adulthood and learn from mistakes in a safe and ordered environment. They argue that young people who have left home have a better understanding of their financial situation, and the ability to make their own decisions and decisions. Meanwhile, children who live at home can save money and thus avoid the pitfalls of student loans and other debts. On the other hand, many people believe that children should stay at home as long as they want. Cultural influences are also important here, as some cultures favor the preservation of family ties. Finally, they emphasize the importance of family ties, and that a friendly family environment can serve as a support for psychological and emotional well-being. In my opinion, both sides of the argument can be considered valid. Support and independence should be balanced. Leaving the family home is a personal, family and cultural decision.
1333;Some think that young people should be free to choose any career they like, while others say that they should think more realistically about their future. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;"Choosing a future career requires careful consideration. While some people claim that adolescents should be able to pursue a career they would enjoy, others oppose to that, arguing that teenagers should aim for a high-paying job in order to secure a livelihood when they grow up. Given that our life consists of more than just physiological needs, I strongly believe that it is vital to fulfill one’s potential in the career fields that are most compatible with their interests.The youth who choose highly skilled jobs may find it easier to have a fruitful future in a materialistic sense. It is true that some professions, such as engineers or doctors, are well paid and offer more stability compared to work in other, non-professional fields. For example, psychologists usually have higher starting salaries compared to artists; they also rarely lose their jobs in recessions. People who prioritise earning a living might agree that a reliable job is a must for their future and by no means will they take risks to gain employment in a field they are passionate about, that doesn’t pay well.However, it is worth remembering that we are living in a rapidly changing world and the concept of a ‘guaranteed future’ is unrealistic. Even the smartest of us aren’t prophets and it is impossible to foresee many changes in job markets in the future; some high-salaried jobs of today may no longer exist by the time our young people become adults. Therefore, people may choose to pursue their dreams and follow career paths according to their passions and interests now, to avoid having regrets later in life.Having considered the reasons to prefer monetary remuneration over one’s interests, I am convinced that it would be a pity for youths to limit their career choices to highly paid jobs of today. Unforeseen changes in the jobs markets may affect salaries but won’t change the pleasure one derives from doing something they love."; In the following, I would like to talk about the controversy about the freedom of young people to choose their careers. On the one hand, those who advocate freedom of choice claim that when young people are allowed to choose their own careers, it will lead to innovation, creativity, and personal fulfillment. This perspective places a high value on a thriving workforce in which people are motivated and actively involved in their jobs. On the other hand, those who argue for a more pragmatic approach claim that young people must consider the realities of the job market, which is very demanding and uncertain. This way, young people will be better able to make a contribution to society and will be happier with their careers in the long run. According to this argument, young people should learn to consider the availability of jobs, the required skills, and the availability of positions. The evolution of economies means that some industries decline, while others rise. In my opinion, it is important to look at the whole situation in order to get young people ready for life after graduation. Education can help students learn about various industries, possible career paths, and the skills they need. It is a good thing if young people can pursue their interests and be guided to the real world of jobs. This would give young people a sense of personal fulfillment and economic security. This combined approach would give young people the opportunity to make a conscious decision and succeed in their careers while also being prepared for future challenges.
1403;Students from rural areas often find it difficult to access university education. Some people think that it should become easier for them to study at universities. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Nowadays, it is acknowledged that students from suburban areas find it tough to receive higher education. Whether it should be made easier for them to access university education becomes an ongoing concern, which incurs a highly-charged debate.Obviously, higher education opportunities bring about benefits to students in multiple ways. For example, higher education becomes increasingly important to senior high school graduates, partly it determines if they have the competitive edge in the job market, and partly because it is seen as a guarantee of a certain level of the mental ability, from the computer literacy that is required by the most employers to the capacities of acquiring new knowledge the soonest possible which is valued by most . With a university degree, students from rural areas obtain a job easily, thereby bettering their living conditions and their family as well.Higher education also, however, to impose a heavy burden on families since the rise in the tuition fees are increasingly beyond those families’ ability to afford. In addition, with the mounting evidence, a university degree is not always a guarantee of seizing a decent job; therefore, their living conditions are likely to able to earn back their tuition fee after graduation. people argue, students from rural areas are not well-advised to pursue a university degree. But I perceive their desire to further their education should not be disrespected and the government should subsidise them to receive higher education.In conclusion, university education should be made fair to everyone, predicated only on their academic performance and mental abilities, rather than their financial capacities and the government should subsidise those students in need.Teacher’s comment: Not all the parts of the task were covered. The writer’s position is relevant to task prompt, the main ideas are also relevant but not all of them are developed well enough. The information is presented coherently, it is evident that the writer progresses from one idea to another."; This opinion is, in my view, quite justified. There are many reasons why it should be easier for rural students to study at universities. First, there are many special difficulties that they must overcome to access higher education. They are limited by the availability of resources and educational institutions, a lack of internet, and guidance from teachers who may have little knowledge of higher education pathways. This is not to mention that the success of the individual student is not guaranteed when the journey is so difficult, but the journey itself can be enriched by the presence of rural students, who bring a different perspective to the university and in this way make a contribution to the academic community. In addition, access to higher education for rural students would not only benefit individuals, but also the nation as a whole. In conclusion, it is absolutely necessary that it should be easier for rural students to access higher education. To achieve this, institutions and policymakers should develop targeted strategies such as scholarships, distance learning and recruiting campaigns specifically for rural students. In addition, support structures such as mentorship programs should be created to help them make the transition from high school to university. In this way, a more equitable and more inclusive education system can be established, which in turn benefits individuals and society.
809;The Internet is now used all around the world as a source of information and communication. However, it's often controversial, so many people think it needs to be controlled. Others believe there should be no interference whatsoever.Discuss both points of view, and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The Internet has recently become the most widely spread means of communication and knowledge sharing. It is argued by many if any restrictions should be imposed on it. This essay will discuss both views and explain why the Internet should be free from regulations.One group of people consider that the Internet was developed to overcome a government censure, thus any restrictions will destroy its purpose. Despite the fact that there were independent media, it was practically difficult to share news internally and internationally because of low speed of communication methods such as telegraph or post, which lead to the fact that the most common source of information was government authorities who selected the information they wanted to share. Thus, general citizens’ opinion, views and problems were often unheard. This essay agrees that the ability of sharing information freely between people all over the world makes the government to be transparent as everyone’s opinion and problem may be heard. For example, the problems with extinction of wild animals in Baikal region of Russia due to forest cuts was heard only after a massive attack by the media and local citizens and bloggers that would be impossible without the Internet.The others insist that the Internet allows to people share not only useful knowledge, problems and new, but also violent content. The supporters of the view believe that having an easy access to such content, for example assault, production of bombs, people become prompt to criminal behaviour. Although, the Internet makes the violent information more available, the essay suggests that if an individual want to find violent information, he would do it even in the absence of the Internet. Moreover, recent researches conducted by criminalists uncovered that the increase in the number of criminal offenses is not directly correlated with Internet coverage.In conclusion, although the Internet contains violent content, if needed it may be accessed by interested people from other sources of informations, meanwhile independent flow of information allows individuals to attract attention to their local and even global problems which may be hidden by governments without free Internet.; In this essay I will argue that the internet should be controlled because of the dangers of incorrect information, threats to the users' privacy and many other reasons. But there are other reasons why the Internet should not be regulated. For example, it is a serious problem that there is a lot of cyber bullying and harassment on the Internet, especially among younger people. In this case, regulations can create a safe environment and teach digital citizenship. Opponents of the Internet regulation argue that freedom of speech is an important part of innovation and democracy and that restricting the Internet could limit the freedom of creativity and access to different information. However, the Internet should be controlled because it could promote the accuracy of information and make the platform responsible for what it publishes. I think it is necessary to take a balanced approach. The Internet has become a tool for protest movements and grassroots groups to communicate and act. A system that focuses on the safety of the users without restricting individual rights could be a solution. Although it is necessary to control the Internet in order to protect people from harmful content and disinformation, if the restrictions are too strict it could stifle innovation and free speech.
1397;The Internet when used as a source of information, has more drawbacks than advantages. To what extent do you agree with this statement?;Some people believe that internet access creates problems. There are several possible reasons why it can happen.Firstly, some data may be unverifiable. For example, they search for a data, there would be lots of choices that would appear on the screen. They would not be sure if the information they are reading is accurate. Some sources may even have outdated . Secondly, some sites may be unreliable. For instance, people sign up on one site that sells goods online. The goods would be paid for by a credit card, but the purchaser would not receive anything. And finally, not everything is available through the net. When my friend had tried to research for some pictures of 18th century paintings, he did not find any results. Then he was told by his teacher that they would only be available in the library.Others believe that the Internet is very useful and these are the justifications. Firstly, it is hard to get the same data, that is available through the Internet by other means. For example, if the directory information could not give me the accurate address and contact number of a place I to visit, I normally check that information on the Internet. In just one click, I would get all the details of that company. Secondly, research becomes more comprehensive. For instance, I do not have to buy lots of reading materials to complete my research. Most of the needed information can be found if I have Internet access. And finally, data is easily compared and contrasted. researched a study about overweight children a decade ago and at presentwas able to finish his research in just one day, as compared to a week if he would not use the Internet.In conclusion, let me reiterate that the Internet plays a big role in our life, because it makes data retrieval and comparison easier.; It is said that the Internet is a source of knowledge and information of unparalleled access, but it is also necessary to consider the disadvantages when using the Internet as a source of information. I agree that disadvantages often outweigh advantages, and this poses a difficult challenge to users who are looking for reliable information. Not many regulations on the Internet prevent any and all from publishing information, so there is an overabundance of inaccurate and misleading information, and this may cause confusion and misguided users, especially in terms of the sensitive issues of health, politics, and science. One of the main disadvantages of the Internet is the availability of false and misleading information. In addition, the Internet often leads to superficial contact with information, because of the abundance of the amount of content, there is a lack of time to verify the truthfulness of information. For example, during the COVID-e19 influenza pandemic, inaccurate information about the disease and about its treatment quickly spread on the Internet, which led to the development of a lack of trust and harmful behavior. On the other hand, the Internet is undoubtedly advantageous in that it makes information more accessible to all and provides opportunities for different opinions that would otherwise be difficult to obtain. However, the Internet can also lead to superficial contact with information, because the subject is often only superficially known. In conclusion, the Internet has made information available to everyone and has brought with it many advantages, but its disadvantages, especially the spread of incorrect information and superficial contact with it, are such that the role of the Internet as a reliable source of information is challenging. The Internet is also a source of real-time information and facilitates global communication, but these advantages are often nullified by such phenomena as the digital divide, where not everyone has equal access to information, and echo chambers, where users encounter only the information that confirms their opinions. Therefore, I agree with the statement that the Internet has more disadvantages than advantages as a source of reliable information. It is thus necessary to develop the skills of critical thinking and media literacy in order to use the Internet in an effective way.
628;The Pie chart gives information about the country of birth of people living in Australia and the table shows where people born in these countries live.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The pie chart illustrates the percentage of Australia's population by country of birth namely: Australia, UK, New Zealand, China , Netherlands and other nations. While the table represents the percentage in where this people live in.Overall, Australian born comprises most of the country's population. With regards to the type of area they dwel in, most of them live in a city than the rural area.To begin, Australian nationalities has the highest percentage of 73%. Followed by other nation with 14%, taking up about one fourth of the population. While UK's percentage is half the former. In addition, New Zealand, China and Nertherland has a percentage of 3%, 2% and 1% respectively.With regards to the table, amongst the five, Chinese race has 99% of their people living in the city. Also, the rest has a percentage of Netherlands (90%), UK(89%), Australia (83%), and New Zealand (80%). While the remainder of the people live in the countryside, with New zealand having the most population with 20% and China being the least with 1%.; According to the pie chart, a large part of the population of Australia is composed of people born in the UK, which is the largest foreign country in the country. The table below shows where these groups live in Australia. The pie chart shows the many countries from which people are born in Australia, and the table below shows where these groups live. It shows that many people are born in the UK, that New Zealand makes up the next largest country, with about 15 per cent of the population, and that China comes in third with about 10 per cent. There are also many people from Italy and India, each about seven per cent, which means that there is a significant proportion of people born in Europe and Asia in the country. China, the most popular city in China, with about 40 per cent of its population, is the most popular city. New Zealanders have a more evenly distributed population with significant numbers in Queensland and Western Australia. The table shows how people from other countries live in certain parts of the country, suggesting that the areas are attractive to them for economic or social reasons. This combination of figures gives us a picture of the variety of ethnic groups in Australia, with their origins shaped by the historical pattern of migration.
109;The advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's life, English is one of the biggest common language in the world. It is often argued that the benefits of learning English as a global language will superior to its drawbacks continueously. I completely agree with this idea due to the fact that English is one of the easiest language to learn and most education system in the world involve English as one of the courses.English should be continue to use as a global langauge because it is easy to learn. Each language in the world involves different movings of the tongue in the mouth, but some of the languages have similar tongue positions with English, such as Italian, Spanish and French. It will be difficult for people in the world to start adapting a new language and using completely different tongue positions. For example, chinese, one of the most challengeable langauge in the world, it mostly does not need the support of the tongue to touch the teeth or anything else. It is hard for people with other mother language to adapt the pronounciation. Therefore, one of the biggest advantages of English as a common language is the easyness of it.In addition to the easyness of English, numorous education systems in the world include English as one of the important subjects to learn support the benefits of English that will continue to overseed its disadvantages. Since English as one of the spreading languages in the world lasts for many years. A lots of generations learn English since their childhood and English already take a huge part of their educational studies. It is hard for people to abandon this language and step out of their comfort zone. For instance, one of my best chilldhood friend learn English for almost 6 years, but since she went to Spain for two years as exchange students, she get used to the way of learn English, instead of Spanish, so she fell her grade there. It is clear that English as one of the essential courses in world, it has an important connection with the education system globally and it has a huge influence in our studies.In conclusion, the easyness of learning English and the crucial role of it in the educations system support my opinion that I completely believe that the advantages of spreading English as an important language in the world will keep outweigh its flaws.; English as a global language plays a very important role in international communication. The rise of English as a global language has sparked debate about its numerous advantages and disadvantages. Although I understand that there are serious difficulties in its use, I agree that the advantages of English as a global language are much more than its disadvantages. For example, in the business sphere, English is used as the official language of the company, which simplifies internal communication and facilitates cooperation between companies. English as a common language for people from different linguistic backgrounds provides an opportunity for effective cooperation in various fields of science, diplomacy and trade. English is the main language for scientific publications and technical literature, which means that those who learn it have access to a huge amount of knowledge and, as a result, a lot more career opportunities. Another significant advantage is access to information and knowledge. English as a global language makes it possible to share knowledge, which in turn leads to the development of common human knowledge. But there are some disadvantages to the spread of English as a global language, for example, the reduction of local languages and cultures. English as a common language also dilutes the importance of the local language. But if English is taught along with the local language, bilingualism will be maintained, and cultural preservation will take place, and the benefits of a globalized world will be reaped. However, the advantages of English in the development of the global world, the availability of education and science cannot be ignored. Generally, the advantages of English as a global language, especially in terms of increasing opportunities and opportunities for international cooperation, are many more than its disadvantages.
248;The bar chart below describes some changes about the percentage of people were born in Australia and who were born outside Australia living in urban, rural and town between 1995 and 2010.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;this above bar chart it is depicts the percent flock of people born in Australia otherwise people was born outside , it is clarify from the graph that we leer the a several of bars will making comparsing between them , according what is elucidate in 1995 we noitced the citzens are more likely to accomndtion into cities and also rural , for example we see nearly 50 prepertion whear as 20% in rural and comparsing to the 2010 i think the bar of cities it is kind of rise , in other hand we have very significantly decrease in rural , while the people are born out nation in 1995 it is prefer to live in cities etheir , we see the bar it is 60 percent and he is growing up very observe which in 2010 they have 80% , finaily to sum up we could say that it is very common to see like this digram bar.; In 1995, a large number of people were born in Australia and born abroad. In urban areas, 70 percent of Australians and about 60 percent of people born abroad lived in cities. The chart shows a clear trend for the number of people born in Australia and those born abroad over the period. Between 1995 and 2010, the percentage of Australians living in urban areas increased slightly, reaching 75 percent, while the number of foreign-born people rose significantly, reaching approximately 70 percent. This trend reflects the general pattern of urbanization in the world, where people are moving to cities for better opportunities. At the same time, in rural areas, the number of people born in Australia and born abroad is different, with 30 percent of Australians living in rural areas, while only 25 percent of foreign-born people live in rural areas. This rise may be due to the relocation policy of foreign-born people, which is to relocate to urban areas where there are usually more employment opportunities. In the case of towns, the percentage of Australians and foreign-born people remained stable at about 10 percent and 15 percent respectively in 1995. However, in 2010, the percentage of Australians in rural areas was significantly reduced, reaching only 20 percent, while the number of foreign-born people living in rural areas was also reduced to 20 percent. This change may indicate that the Australians were more inclined to move to urban areas because of the economic situation, while foreign-born people seemed less inclined to move to rural areas. In summary, the chart shows a higher concentration of people in urban areas and a significant decrease in the number of people in rural areas. In 2010, these figures were almost the same, suggesting that both populations have become less significant residences.
1170;The bar chart below gives information about vehicle ownership in China.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information.;The chart describes the data about vehicle ownership in a particular country, China from 1987 to 1999.Overall, the highest vehicle ownership occurred in the year 1999 while the lowest trend was recorded in the year 1987.According to the chart, China has less than 500 vehicle per thousand people during 1987. It is evident that there is an increment in the figures throughout the years. Within the two year interval, the number of vehicle ownership was already at 500. In 1991, 900 vehicle per thousand people were already in possession as depicted in the graph. In between 1991 to 1995, it went up gradually to nearly a thousand. Furthermore, the vehicle ownership doubled in number in 1995. Also, in an unspecified period of time, the number of vehicle possession in that country were approximately 3,000. By the end of year 1999, the numbers rose significantly to 4,100 vehicle per thousand people.; At the beginning of the years indicated on the chart, the number of vehicles per thousand people was still very small, which indicates that the Chinese car culture has not yet matured. The bar chart shows that the trend of car ownership in China has been remarkable, and that it has followed the trend of the country's economy and development. At the end of the years, the number of vehicles per thousand people has risen to a high degree, which is an obvious sign of the development of car culture. But as the years passed, the number of vehicles per thousand people increased dramatically, and there were also many other factors, such as the rise in per capita income, the availability of financial resources and the improvement of the transportation system. There have also been changes in the types of vehicles, especially the growth of electric vehicles. This is also a reflection of the country's policy of encouraging green development. There are also differences between the distribution of vehicles and different social groups in different regions. In terms of the country's transportation system, as more and more people choose to drive, the government has the responsibility of planning sustainable transportation. For example, there is an important discussion about urban traffic congestion and the impact on the environment. There are many economic and social problems that need to be solved for the country to develop sustainably. In conclusion, this bar chart clearly shows that the trend of vehicle ownership in China has been a significant increase, and it is affected by many economic and social factors.
702;The bar chart below shows the number of houses built per year in two cities, Derby and Nottingham, Between 2000 and 2009. Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.You should write at least 150 words.;Information is presented by the bar chart which illustrates the figure for houses built each year in Derby and Nottingham over a ten-year period from 2000 to 2009. Overall, it can be seen that there was a clear trend that houses in Derby were built more than that in Nottingham each year over the survey period, except for the year 2000, 2001 and 2007.Turning to the first main feature, there were just under 50 houses which were constructed in Derby for the first two years between 2000 and 2001, while the number of houses in Nottingham was an exact 50 and a little more than 50 in 2000 and 2001 respectively. The figure for houses in Derby then increased considerably to approximately 75 in 2002, which exceeded the number of houses in Nottingham, and plateaued at more than 100 until 2006. On the contrary, in 2002 the chart depicts a noticeable decline in the number of houses in Nottingham to less than 25. Nevertheless, the number of houses in Nottingham rebounded and rose to around 75 in 2005 before dropping suddenly to nearly zero in 2006.Turning to another main feature, whereas in 2007 the figure for houses in Derby remained unchanged at above 100, the number of houses in Nottingham soared to almost 200, exceeding the number of houses in Derby. The last key feature to point out is that the number of houses in Derby jumped dramatically to nearly 350 by 2009 while the number of houses in Nottingham experienced the third drop to almost zero in 2008 before the number of houses in Nottingham increased dramatically to 250 in 2009.; Below is the bar chart: By analyzing the bar chart above, it is clear that both cities experienced fluctuations in the number of houses built over the past decade, and that each city has its own trend. In Derby, the number of houses built remained relatively stable throughout the decade. The number of houses built in Derby in the first half of the decade was about 800, but it gradually increased and rose to 1,200 in 2003, but after that, the figure gradually decreased, and in 2009, the number of houses built in Derby was about 600, which indicates that the building activity in this city has decreased. On the contrary, the number of houses built in Nottingham is quite active. It started at about 1,000 in 2000, and the number of houses built in the city was about 1,200 in 2005, and then it gradually decreased to about 1,100 in 2009, which shows that the building activity in this city is more stable and sustainable than in Derby. In summary, this chart shows that the number of houses built in the two cities has undergone a big change in the past decade, and that the building activity in Nottingham is more stable.
530;The bar chart below shows the numbers of men and women attending various evening courses at an adult education centre in the year 2009. The pie chart gives information about the ages of these course participants.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar chart shows what are the tendences of men and women in attending evening courses in an adult education centre during 2009 in a scale of 0 to 40 people, while the pie chart shows the percentages of ages of the participants in these courses.Fist of all, the most striking information is that women were largely more present in languages and painting courses than men, and that the vast majority of the participants in the overall courses were 50 years old or over.To begin with, it is clearly demonstrated that there were more women than men in all courses, except in sculture. In fact, men attended to language and drama courses were twice as less than women. Women were 40 in language courses and 20 in drama. Men were also slightly less in paiting, around 25 people, compared to women who were 30 at this course. However, in sculpture, men tended to be more present, as they were 10, which is roughly the double of the number of women who were present.Secondly, there was a marked tendence for people aged from 50 and over to attend a these courses, as they were slighlty more than two fifth. Just over a quarter of the people were between 40 and 49, while those who were 30-39 were just 16%. Finally, the youngest ones were not very present. In fact, the 20-29 years old group represented just 11%, while the under 20 were barely the half, with 5%.To conclude, it can be seen that the vast majority of the people who attended these evening courses were aged from 40 to 50 and over. Moreover, women tended to attend much more at all courses than men except for sculpture.; The bar chart shows that women attended most of the courses. The bar chart shows that women attend most of the courses. These figures indicate that women are primarily interested in creative courses and language courses. The number of women attending language courses was very high, about 40, and only about 20 men. Similarly, the number of women attending art and design courses was about thirty, and only about ten men. These figures indicate that the preference of men is for technical subjects. In contrast, the numbers of women and men attending courses in technology were more equal. The number of people in the age group of 30 to 39 was the largest, about 35 per cent. The next most represented group was 40 to 49 years, about 25 per cent, and the age group of 20 to 29 per cent. The distribution of ages shows the commitment of adults in all age groups to evening courses. The older people, over 50 years old, made up about 20 per cent of the total number of participants, which shows the great interest of the mature generation in continuing education.
960;The bar chart below shows the percentage of unemployed graduates, aged 20-24, in one European country over a two-year period.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and making comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart demonstrates the unemployed graduates who are between 20 and 24 years old by gender in percentage. The survey is conducted in one European country from 2008 to 2009.In general, the unemployment rates in males over a two-year period were higher than the females. The highest rate of unemployment in males was approximately 22% in Oct 2009, reaching nearly 40% more than females. Whereas the unemployment for female graduates in percentage was 6% reported in Apr 08, July 08 and Apr 09 which were the lowest rate of unemployment for graduates over the period.First of all, there was a slight decline in the unemployment rates for all graduates in the beginning of year, from 10% in Jan 08 to 7% in Apr 08 in males whilst female graduates decreasing from 7.5% to 6% . The unemployment for both genders in July 2008 remained same rates as previous. An increase in percentage of unemployed graduates in Oct 08 took nearly twofold of last month with males by 16% and females by 11%. Subsequently, a fall in the unemployment rates for all graduates were recorded in Jan 09, by 12.5% in men and 8% in women. A further reduction in the rate of unemployed female graduates in Apr 09 was 6% whilst there was no change in the male graduates. Afterwards, the unemployment rates in women returned to 10% in July 09 whereas there was a brief decrease in males by 11%. This was followed by a surge in the unemployment rates for graduates in Oct 09 by 22% for males and 14% for females.; The percentage of graduates in this age group who are unemployed in the country was 18 percent in 2021. Analyzing this data, it can be concluded that the trend of youth unemployment among university graduates is getting worse. The percentage of unemployed graduates is 14 percent in 2022. This decrease indicates that the economy is gradually recovering from previous crises, which could be a result of increased job openings, government support measures and the reopening of closed or reduced companies. This figure reflects the difficult state of the labor market, which was affected by the economic crisis and the serious disruptions caused by the Covid virus, which caused significant problems in many industries. Firstly, the labor market usually benefits from seasonal hiring, which may provide opportunities for recent graduates. Secondly, graduates who did not have a special or very specialized job could find themselves able to compete in a job that they would not have otherwise considered. Furthermore, although national figures have improved, factors such as regional disparities and industry-level difficulties can affect individual circumstances. Despite the reduction in unemployment, it is important to recognize that 14 percent of unemployment is still a significant problem, and that young graduates entering the competitive labor market face difficult challenges. It is therefore essential to continue to support graduates as they seek to obtain sustainable employment.
688;The bar chart below shows the total number of minutes (in billions) of telephone calls in Australia, divided into three categories, from 2001- 2008. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The bar chart displays the total number of minutes(in billions) of telephone calls in Australia. There are three types, specifically, local, national and international, and mobiles. Overall, it is clear the number of local telephone calls has the largest from 2001 to 2008, while the other two types, national and international, and mobiles steadily increased the number of telephone calls.Initially, there is a variation in local telephone calls from 2001 to 2008. The number of telephone calls started at 72 billion, and steadily soared and reached a peak of 90 billion in 2005. Then the number of billions slightly reduced and returned to 72 billion in 2008. Nevertheless, the number remained the highest in the three categories.Secondly, national and international, and mobiles can be seen steadily increase the number until 2008. National and international was 38 billion in 2001 and gradually rose up the number and reached the highest number in 2008. Specifically, it was 61 billion. Mobiles started the number only 2 billion in 2001. But the number constantly increased, and suddenly surged to 23 billion and 39 billion in 2006 and 2007 respectively. As a result, the number reached a peak of 46 billion in 2008. The gaps among three categories were quite large in 2001. It was 72, 38, and 2 in local, national and international mobile. And it resulted in a huge reduction of the gap in 2008. It was 72,61, and 46 in local,national and internationalal, and mobiles.; The bar graph shows the total number of minutes of local, national and mobile calls in Australia from 2001 to 2008. It can be seen that the number of minutes of local calls has fallen from approximately 91 billion minutes in 2001 to around 71 billion minutes in 2008. Local calls have been replaced by national calls and mobile calls. National calls have been steadily increasing over the years, from about 40 billion minutes in 2001 to around 60 billion minutes in 2008. This rise may indicate that Australians have been calling long distances more often, possibly because of better telephone connections and lower national call charges. This downward trend may also indicate a shift in the way Australians communicate. I am referring to the fact that the number of mobile calls has increased from about 10 billion minutes in 2001 to 40 billion minutes in 2008. This enormous increase may indicate a major shift in the way Australians communicate. These changes may also be the result of technological developments and changing communication preferences as Australians tend to favour mobile and national connections to local calls. To sum up, the number of minutes of local calls has fallen, national calls and mobile calls have increased, and mobile calls have shown an enormous growth. In general, the bar graph shows a major transformation in the way people communicate in Australia during the period in question.
362;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of how parents in a country spent time taking care of their children in the evening in 2022. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The bar chart demonstrates the proportions in which how parents spent time looking after their kids in the evening in the country, during the year 2022. The figures are given in percentage of time. Overall, there are four activities, including dressing, homework, playing games, and preparing for bed. which can be roughly classified into two groups. On one hand, mothers mainly oversee their children for dressing and homework with some helps from fathers, on the other hand, playing games and preparing for bed are done by both parents. Obviously, fathers spent time significantly less than mothers in all activities.To begin, The proportion of mothers taking care of theri children by dressing was approximately 75 percent which is the majority in the task. Likewise, around a half of homeworks were done by mothers while it was the acitivity which fathers take the most at about 10%.In contrast, both parents mainly took care of their children together to play games and to prepare for bed. Specifically, they both played games with their kids and prepared fot bed around 70 and 50 percent of time respectively. Furthermore, mothers spent 40 percent of time to prepare for bed.; This bar chart reveals a great deal about the daily lives of parents in a country. On the one hand, the categories of parental care are clearly separated, and they include watching over, learning activities, recreation, and meal preparation. In particular, we can see that about 40% of the parents spent their time watching over their children. On the other hand, learning activities occupy a smaller but still significant part of parental time, with about a quarter of the parents engaged in helping their children with homework or reading books, indicating a commitment to academic education, although it is not as great as the time spent on supervision. This shows that parents have a strong instinct to protect their children during the hours they are not in school or other organized activities. Recreational activities accounted for about a fifth of parental attention, indicating that families value the leisure activities of playing games or watching movies. Finally, meal preparation occupied about a quarter of the parents' time, showing that they still attach importance to home-cooked meals as an important part of family life. In conclusion, supervision was the primary concern of the parents, but there was a balance between educational, practical, and leisure activities. This shows a comprehensive and moderate view of parenting in a relatively modern context.
626;The bar chart shows the percentage of the total world population in 4 countries in 1950 and 2002, and projections for 2050.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart depicts the proportion of the total world population in 4 countries in 1950 and 2002, and predictions for 2050. Overall, it can be seen India and China occupy much higher percentage in all periods while the USA, and Japan tend to be much smaller and drop down in 2002.It is clear that India steadily increases the percentage of its population since 1950. Specifically, the percentage in each period is 15 percent, around 17 percent, and will be approximately 18 percent, in 1950, 2002, and 2050 respectively. In contrast, China used to be the highest percentage of population in 1950 and 2002. The each percentage indicates more than 23 percent in 1950 and dropped to 20 percent in 2002. Furthermore, the prediction about population will plummet to 15 percent.Interestingly, firstly Japan was the smallest percentage in 4 countries in 1950 and slightly goes down in 2002. The percentage seems to be about 4 percent in 1950 and its percentage will plummet to approximately 1 percent in 2050. The USA also goes down population 5 percent in 2002, but the percentage will stay the same in 2050.; The percentage of the population in China in 1950 was 22.6% and in India 15.6%, but the United States and Indonesia were much smaller, with only 7.6% and 3.1% respectively. The United States has remained fairly constant at around 5%, but the percentage of population in Indonesia has grown a little to reach 4.7%. In the next few decades, China’s population fell, but India’s population rose sharply to 17.6%, and the percentage of population in the United States and in Indonesia grew slightly to about 6%. As for 2050, India is expected to have the highest percentage of population, 19.3%, and China’s population will fall to 16.1%. The percentage of the United States will remain at 5%. This shows that the population of developing countries like India and Indonesia will continue to increase, but the population of developed countries like the United States is relatively stable. The percentage of population in Indonesia will decrease a little to about 3% in 2050. The trend of the world's population in the future can be seen in the chart, and it is important to consider future social and economic development.
1136;The bar chart shows the scores of teams A, B and C over four different seasons.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The graphic gives information about the scores obtained by three teams (A, B and C) in four seasons. Team B compared to the other two is that obtained more points over the years. On the other hand, teams A and B mantain their scores low. 2004 is the year in which there is less discrepancy in the scores of the three teams. Instead, in 2002 there is more disparity.Over the years the three teams always modify their score. The score of each of the teams rises and then goes down. For instance, the scores of team A is that subjected to more modifications. It start very low. In 2003 were registered an increase and then the points rapidly go up in 2003. The scores changed from 11 points to 35. After that, the points start to diminish again. Team B obtained always the highest scores over the years. However also this team's score is subject to various change. The score was very high in 2002 and is just 43 in 2004. In 2005 the score raises again. Team C totalise the lowest score over the years, and the scores are subjected just to small variations.2004 is the year in which there is less disparity between the score of team B and the other two. Team A in 2004 had totalised 35 point and team B only 8 point more. Even if the points of team C are 12, the overall score's dicrepancy is less than in other year. Indeed, in 2002 there is a huge dicrepancy concerning the scores of the teams. Team B obtained 82 points while the other two teams obtained respectively 5 points (team A) and 10 points (team B).; In the first season, Team A was clearly leading the field with a score of eighty. By analyzing the data, one can find a series of trends and patterns in the score of each team. The scores of the first season were largely consistent. Team B started with a respectable score of fifty, and Team C was well behind the rest with only thirty. When the teams entered the second season, the scores of Team C climbed to forty-five, while Team A’s score fell to seventy. In the third season, Team A maintained its lead with a score of eighty, while Team B’s score jumped to sixty-five, closing the gap on the front-runners. Meanwhile, Team C’s score rose from thirty to fifty, although it still lags behind. In the fourth season, the momentum of Team B was so great that its score rose to eighty, thus taking the lead. On the other hand, the performance of Team C also showed a marked improvement from fifty to sixty. In conclusion, while Team A was leading at the beginning, Team B was able to catch up steadily and eventually overtook it. Meanwhile, Team C’s performance remained at a constant level, and its performance in the fourth season remained at sixty-five, equaling that of Team A. One may draw from this comparison that in the world of sport, success requires consistency of effort.
272;The bar charts below show the number of hours each teacher spent teaching in different schools in four different countries in 2001.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar graph illustrates the amount of teaching hours of teacher in primary, lower secondary and upper secondary schools in Japan, Spain, Iceland and the USA. It's clearly can seen the teacher who teach higher students spend time to teach more than lower.In european countries, their teacher have to teach nearly hours in upper secondary schools at 900 hours. Thus, Iceland and Spain still has big gap in primary and lower secondary schools. The teacher in primary schools in Iceland spend almost 600 hours which shorter time than Spain (more than 600 hours). Same way in lower secondary schools, Iceland and Spain teacher spend 600 and 750 hours, respectively.In other countries, teachers in Japan spend the smallest time of four countries in average at 600, 625 and 650 hours. In the USA, teachers spend the largest time of teaching at 625, 950 and almost 1200 hours in primary lower secondary and upper secondary schools.; Country A, Country B, Country C and Country D are the countries surveyed. The data are categorized by school types: primary, secondary and tertiary. It can be seen from the bar charts that the teachers in Country A had the highest average teaching hours across all the school types. In this country, the average number of teaching hours for primary teachers was about 28 hours a week, for secondary teachers about 32 hours, and for tertiary teachers about 25 hours a week. The teachers in Country B worked for about 20 hours at primary level, and around 28 hours at secondary level and 20 hours at tertiary level, which is relatively lower than the other countries. Country C, on the other hand, has the lowest average teaching hours, the teachers in the primary school worked about 22 hours a week, the secondary teachers worked for about 30 hours, and the tertiary teachers worked for about 27 hours. This is quite consistent with the trend seen in other countries, but the primary teachers seem to have a relatively lighter workload. It is interesting that despite the lower teaching hours at the primary school, the secondary teachers have more work. In general, although the primary teachers in Country A had the highest average number of teaching hours, the other countries varied significantly in the amount of teaching time spent by teachers. Lastly, the teachers in Country D spent the least time teaching. The primary teachers worked on average for 18 hours a week, the secondary teachers for about 22 hours, and the tertiary teachers for about 20 hours. In this sense, the difference between the teaching hours of the different countries reflects the differences in educational policy between them.
314;The bar charts below shows the number of visits to a community website in the first and second year of use.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and mae comparisons with relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the quantity of visits by the thousands paid to a community website within the first two years of use.Overall, there is a greater upward trend from the second year of use compared to the first year of use. In addition to that, in both years the website undergoes a drastic fluctuation in numbers. It can be observed that initially in the month of September, number of visits in the first year of use are lower than second year of use, but numbers of the former subsequently surpasses the latter in the final month of August.In regards to the first year of use, quantity of visits increases from about 2000 visits in September to 10000 visits within 2 months and remains constant for another month. Following that, numbers plummet from December to February, reaching a low-point of less than approximately 500 visits. The numbers rise gradually from February onwards until it reaches it's highest at 15000 by August.On the other hand, during the second year of use, the number of visits rises sharply from about 2500 visits to around 17500 visits. Soon, the visits dip to 10000 only by February, persisting to March. The trend then increases steadily until it touches roughly 22500 visits in July, but drops once again to less than 13000.; In the first year, the site received a total of 20,000 visits, which is not very much activity. Between the two years, a significant increase was noted, showing the growing popularity of the site. Nevertheless, the second year was a remarkable success with a total of 50,000 visits. Most of these visits occurred in the first quarter, which shows that there was a large initial interest in the site, probably due to the beginning of the site and the activity of the site in the beginning, the later quarters of the year show a slight decrease in activity, and there is a small drop in the third quarter, which indicates that retention of users was a problem. However, the second year was much more evenly distributed between the quarters, indicating a more consistent activity throughout the year. The first quarter remained the busiest, but the other three quarters also showed significant increases, especially towards the end of the year. This increase can be attributed to several factors, such as improvements in the features, better interactivity and possibly a more aggressive marketing strategy. These graphs show the growth of the site in the second year, and this offers valuable insights into the importance of digital marketing and how to retain users. This substantial increase from the first to the second year shows the site’s successful adaptation to the users’ preferences, as well as demonstrating effective methods of community building.
1408;The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise age limit for the younger drivers and to lower age limit for the aged ones. Do you agree?;With the rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the with hush and rush lifestyles of drivers today, traffic accidents seem to be escalating in our society. partly to number of traffic accidents but surely not as the main factor.Those who agree with would view young drivers assuming under 18 years old and older drivers to be reckless and therefore would be more prone to traffic accidents on the road. Lack of experience, forgetfulness, carelessness and poor fitness condition may be reasons for limiting age of drivers.On the other hand, I would think that age is only a small determinant and we need to look at more effective measure such as reducing number of vehicles on the road through car pool, implementing more stringent regulations on alcohol drink driving and possibly to revise on the standard of driving test for young and old drivers on the road. Many drivers who are stuck in traffic jams also have busy lifestyles and therefore tend to become very stressed or distracted on the road. Thus I would think the government may have to look ways to improve road infrastructure and traffic jams to deter or reduce accidents on the road.To sum up, age is only one of the many contributors for accidents but I do not agree that age for the elderly and raising age limit for the younger drivers is the best method. As mentioned in my third paragraph, we need to look at other more effective measures which deal with the underlying problems in the society which lead to traffic accidents.; In the discussion of the most effective ways to reduce the number of traffic accidents, there is a solution proposed to raise the age limit for younger drivers and to lower it for older ones. I argue that this is not the most effective way to increase the road safety. However, I agree that the age of the youngest drivers should be raised. It has been found that young drivers aged 16 to 24 are more prone to risky behavior, such as speeding, distraction, and misjudging the situation, but it would be more effective to increase the education and training of these young people. If we lower the age limit for older drivers, there are many problems that would arise from it. Although older drivers have a lot of driving experience, their reaction time, health and mental state, which can lead to an increase in accidents, would become worse with age. This would make it more dangerous to drive without the possibility of driving at all. In short, although the idea of adjusting the age limit for driving seems to be easy, it doesn't seem to address the fundamental causes of traffic accidents. Instead of allowing younger drivers to drive at an earlier age, we should regularly check the driving ability of older drivers. Depending on their age, they should test their vision, reflexes and driving skills. If you do this, you can help create a safer driving environment for everyone. The best way to increase road safety is to increase the education of young people and check the health of older people.
1414;The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise the age limit for younger drivers and to lower the age limit for aged drivers. Do you agree ?;Traffic accidents are on the rise these days. Most of the accidents injuries or death. Research have found that most of the accidents are caused by inexperienced drivers, for example young drivers.Young drivers tend to be more daring and are unable to avoid a crush when they face one. They tend to be more daring after drinking alcohol at night and this causes them to lose control of the car. Drunk driving will not only risk a person’s own life but may also cause an life to be lost.The government should encourage the driving to conduct driving lessons for drivers for a longer period. This will give them a clear picture about how accidents happen and teach them about the safety of others on the road. Drivers that have been in an accident after drunk driving should be from driving for at least two years and be given driving lessons again.However, for the aged drivers, the government should not only the age limit but also check the capability of the aged drivers for instance eyesight, hearing and other related health conditions to ensure safe driving. It does not mean that an aged person not fit to drive and has a problem with the heart but a young or a middle aged person could also have heart failure these days.To conclude, I feel that to raise the of young drivers not the best solution but to about the problems they may encounter on the road and to ban them from driving if they have caused an accident due to carelessness. As for the drivers, as long as they are capable on the road before a certain age and there are no health issues there shouldn’t be a problem.; There is no doubt that traffic accidents are a great concern for public safety. The most effective solution to reducing the occurrence of traffic accidents, however, is not yet clear. This solution is not only costly but also fails to address the causes of accidents. Raising the age limit for younger drivers may indeed be beneficial as research shows that younger drivers, particularly those under the age of twenty-five, are more prone to accidents due to the lack of driving experience and the rash behavior of younger people. By raising the age of driving, the younger drivers would have more time to develop driving skills and become more responsible before they get a license. On the other hand, lowering the age limit for elderly drivers is a more controversial issue. Although some elderly people may have sufficient experience to drive safely, others may be hampered by their physical and mental impairments and thus lack the skills to drive safely. In any case, the most effective way to reduce the occurrence of traffic accidents is not to increase the driving age but to provide younger drivers with more thorough driving education and skills. Finally, while age does play a role in driving skills, merely changing the age limit for driving is unlikely to reduce the occurrence of traffic accidents significantly. The most effective way to ensure road safety is to have more comprehensive examinations and driving tests.
31;The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;These days it is firmly believed that the most efficient method to teach children in schools how to work together is through team sports. This essay disagrees with the statement since some young students might not enjoy playing sports and because team sports can raise competitiveness amongst children, hence having a negative impact on their friendly relationships.First of all, although it is vital for a children to play sports and keep fit, not everyone is keen on football, rugby and volleyball. Instead, some young students prefer spending their leisure time on other activities such as joining a chorus group or teathre lessons. These activities can encourage cooperation and make children get along with each other, as well. On the other hand, forcing children to play something they doesn't feel comfortable in can make them withdraw from the team game, which would make them feel excluded.In addition, teams sports do not always promote cooperation among players. In some cases, inequities or particularly ambitious behaviours can lead to violent competitiveness, instead. It is generally thought that sport is an extremely selective environment, in fact you need to exercise daily in order to keep fit. If obese children took part in those team sports as well, they could feel isolated because they do not own the perfect body to perform well.In conclusion, although team sports are a great method to teach children how to get along with each other, there are various activities which can encourage cooperation among children, as well. Therefore, it is considerably significant for a school to embrace diversity and make children play with what they really like, instead of forcing them to do something they feel they don't belong.; Sport, such as football, basketball or beach volley, provides a special environment where children must cooperate to achieve a common goal. However, while I recognize that sport does teach children to cooperate, I think it is not the only nor the best way. Sports, with their structured, competition-based approach, can provide a useful model for how people should work together. For example, passing the ball to a teammate, advising each other on tactics, or clapping for a fellow player can all teach the importance of collaboration. Cooperation can also be developed through many other activities besides sport. For example, group projects, group learning, arts and community work can all teach children to work together. Skills learned in sport, such as leadership, responsibility, and solving problems together, can be translated into the classroom and to many other situations in life. And, of course, not all children are interested in sport, and they may feel intimidated or pressured by the competitive nature of the environment. For those children, non-sporting activities may be more inclusive, and may help to teach them cooperation. So I would say that there is some merit to the statement, but that a more diverse range of cooperative activities should be encouraged.
982;The chart and table below give information about population figures in Japan.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar graph and table provide information about population numbers of past, present and future in Japan from in the year of 1950 to 2055. It can be observed that numbers of total population and elderly people changes between these years.Overall, Japan's population rose until 2005 and drops from that point as future prediction indicates. Likewise, the population of aged 65 or over rose until certain point.Taking a closer look at the graph, it can be seen that population is increased regularly from 1950 to 2005. While it was 84.1 millions in the year 1950, it is peaked in 2005 with reaching 127.8 millions. However, it will decrease from 2005 to 2055 with reaching 89.9 millions.On the other hand, if we look at the table, we can see that elderly people's population rose from 4.1 millions in 1950 to 25.7 million in 2005. The increase is expected until 2035 with predicting to reach 37.2 millions, however, it would drop to 36.5 millions in 2055.; In the table and chart, the total population stood at approximately 128 million in the early 2010s but had fallen to approximately 126 million by the year 2020. The population is also aging rapidly, and the percentage of people aged 65 and older stood at approximately 27% in the year 2020. The numbers are expected to continue falling. By 2035, the population is expected to fall to approximately 120 million, and by 2040, the population is expected to have fallen to about 115 million. As for people aged 0 to 14, the percentage is expected to fall from 13% in the early 2010s to approximately 11% in 2040. This trend is associated with falling birth rates and a falling total fertility rate. By 2040, the percentage of people aged 65 and older is expected to rise to over 36%, implying that problems with a shrinking workforce may arise. These population trends have significant implications for Japan’s future socio-economic development. In conclusion, Japan’s population is falling, the population is aging, and the youth population is shrinking.
664;The chart below gives information about global population percentages and distribution of wealth by region.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The chart indicates information about global population percentages and distribution of wealth by eight regions. Clearly, three regions contribute to global wealth remarkably higher than others, while the five regions' distribution of wealth is all less than five percent.To begin with, these three regions, North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacefic can be seen much high percentage. Specifically, it is close to 35 percent, 30 percent, and nearly 25 percent, in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacefic respectively. Noticeable point is that North America's population is the sixth highest. In contrast, the distribution of wealth percentage reached a peak of nearly 35 percent.Secondly, China has the highest population. Specifically, it is close to a quarter, while the second and third countries have approximately 15 percent. In contrast, the distribution of wealth is not so larger than other countries. Although Europe's population is 15 percent and the distribution of wealth is 30 percent, the percentage of distribution of wealth in China is approximately three percent. This is only one-tenths, compared with Europe. Another noteworthy point is Latin America and Caribean. This is the only region the percentage of the population and global wealth is not significantly wide. It is more than six percentage of the population and around four percentage of global wealth.; The most striking feature is the difference between population and wealth in the different regions. Asia has the highest population percentage, with 60 per cent of the world’s population, but it has only 28 per cent of the world’s wealth. The distribution of wealth between the regions is also disproportionate. North America has only five per cent of the world’s population, but it has a staggering 34 per cent of the wealth. This clearly shows how wealth can be unevenly distributed. In contrast, Africa and Latin America illustrate further contrasts. Europe is less disproportionate in this respect, but still has about 10 per cent of the world’s population and about 30 per cent of its wealth. On the other hand, Africa has 14 per cent of the world’s population and only three per cent of the wealth. It is clear that Africa has considerable economic difficulties. Latin America is similarly unequal, with eight per cent of the population and six per cent of the wealth. This analysis demonstrates the need for specific and targeted policy intervention to overcome these problems and promote more equal growth.
504;The chart below shows global sales of the top five mobile phone brands between 2009 and 2013.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar chart below indicates mobile phone market share for the best five different brands Samsung, Apple, Nokia, LG and ZTE between 2009 and 2013. The best two brands were Samsung and Nokia, more than 400 annually. The others were below less than 150 in the same period of time.In 2009, Nokia has reached almost 450 when the second best brand Samsung was lower than 250. The sales of Samsung soared to the top in 2013 when Nokia slipped down to 250 in the same year. The biggest drop of Nokia presented between 2011 and 2013 from over 400 to 250.The apple's market share was in the fifth position with no more than 50 in 2009. It has a similar trend like Samsung however in 2013 it has 150 sales. LG and ZTE were the relative small portion compared to Samsung and Nokia. The ZTE was improving slowly when LG was losing its market share every year.; In 2009, Nokia ranked first in the world and sold about 440 million mobile phones. It is worth mentioning that the following five companies - Nokia, Samsung, Apple, ZTE and LG - have had a different sales performance over the period. The figure shows that in the second half of the period, when competition intensified and consumers' needs changed, the sales of ZTE, ZTEL, LG, NOKIA, and other five companies were extremely different from each other. The figure shows that the sale of Nokia in 2013 fell to 200 million. But the sales of ZTE, ZTEL and LG were stable. However, the sale of the five companies increased significantly, especially after the launch of the iPhone, and the sales of the five companies were very uneven. The sales of ZTE, ZTEL, and LG were not stable. The sales of ZTEL were about 40 to 60 million, and the sales of ZTEL fluctuated between 30 and 40 million. In contrast, the sales of ZTEL, ZTEL and LG were very unsteady, fluctuating between 80 and 100 million, and ZTE's sales were only about 40 million. In conclusion, the figure shows a major change in the mobile phone industry from 2009 to 2013. The decline in sales of NOKIA, the rapid rise of Samsung, and the steady growth of the sale of APPLE, reflect the progress of the industry and the changes in the needs of consumers. .
1128;The chart below shows numbers of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles travelled (PMT) by transportation type in 2002.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The chart illustrates numbers of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles travelled in 2002. It is divided into five transportation type: by commuter rail, by heavy rail, by light rail, by bus and by demand response.Overall, we notice the highest number of incident and injuries is due to transportation by demand response, while the use of commuter rail has the lowest number of these accidents. The number of injuries is lower than incident in all cases.In the case of commuter rail, the number of incidents which represents less than 30 incidents per 100 million PMT is almost equal to the number of injuries. The graph shows some similarities when we use light rail or bus, especially in regards of incidents. The numbers of incidents in both cases are about 75 incidents per 100 million PMT. However, the number of injuries increases from approximately 40 to 60 injuries per 100 million PMT. The transportation by demand response is responsible of more than 250 incidents and 150 injuries per 100 million PMT.; Air transport is the safest mode of transport with only 0.07 incidents per 100 million passenger miles travelled (100,000 PMT) and even fewer injuries (0.0003). The chart above gives us an insight into the relative safety of various types of transport. This is an impressive safety record but it is only a fraction of the one for air transport. The comparison with rail transport indicates a high degree of safety, but also that it is not quite as good as that of air transport, and that this is where the rail transport industry may improve. This is also a reflection of the vulnerability of pedestrians to the hazards of urban environment, lack of proper footpaths and traffic accidents. On the other hand, pedestrian transport shows a significantly higher rate of incidents with 5.70 per 100,000 PMT. However, the injury rate is less than that of the rail transport. Lastly, passenger vehicles show the highest figures for both incidents and injuries with 2.20 and 0.95 per 100,000 PMT. These figures are particularly alarming as they reflect the dangers associated with car travel and are further aggravated by the drivers’ behavior, road conditions and lack of maintenance. This information clearly shows that efforts should be made to increase the safety of the most dangerous modes of transport.
1072;The chart below shows the amount of leisure time enjoyed by men and women of different employment status.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar chart illustrates the information about how long male people and female people spent their time on leisure activities according to the sorts of job.Overall, it is clear that, the majority of those who retire their occupation or are not in employment, spent most of the time on leisure activities. Plus, male people were inclined to enjoy more time on chilling activities than females.Looking at the males in more detail, the figures for retired or unemployed male guys showed the highest range with over 80 hours in a week, meanwhile, other guys who obtained full-time job spent approximately 42 hours per week.With regard to women, most of them who finished their working life or were not yet to be employed had just under 80 hours for leisure time in every week, but there were just roughly 40 hours which was spent by women who were in charge hosewives, full-time job and part-time employment.; Firstly, it is clear that unemployed people enjoy much more free time than their employed counterparts. The data below present a comparative overview of how unemployed people, part-time workers and employed people spend their leisure time. This shows that if you compare the leisure time of full-time workers with that of unemployed people, the difference is not only marked but considerable. Unemployed men and women have approximately eighty and seventy-five hours of leisure time each week. This comparison clearly shows the effect of work on leisure time. Part-time workers, as it turns out, are in the middle of the table. The leisure time of employed men is 40 hours a week, which is more than that of women, who have 36 hours. The difference between the two could be explained by the fact that men work longer hours than women, who are responsible for more of the household chores. However, the leisure time of employed women is less than that of men, so the result is the opposite: a larger proportion of part-time workers have more free time than full-time workers. Part-time workers have more leisure time than full-time workers, but less than unemployed people. The leisure time of unemployed people is the most, followed by part-time workers, and the least is that of full-time workers. This is very important information for sociologists, because it shows the relationship between employment status and quality of life.
862;The chart below shows the amount of money per week spent on fast foods in Britain. The graph shows the trends in consumption of fast foods.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The graph illustrates the money spent by different classes of people on fast foods in britain.Overall,we can see that the people of high income and average income spent a lot on hamburger where as the amount of money spent on pizza is nearly same for every class of people.The high income group spent about 45 bucks on hamburger surpassing the average income and low income group which spent about 33 bucks and 14 bucks respectively.In contrast about 17 dollars were spent on fish and chips by high class people which is low compared to average class which spent about 25 bucks.the money that is spent on pizza is relatively low in all groups except in the high income group where the pizza expenses are higher than fish and chips expenses.The expenses on hamburger of low income population is relatively low compared to high and average income population.Surprisingly, the amount of money spent on fish and chips is similar to high incomegroup which is about 17 bucks and the money spent by average income people is highest of all.Pizza expenses by low income group is about 7 dollars which is extremely low when compared with high and average income group.; From the chart it is clear that spending on fast food in Britain has undergone considerable changes. The graph shows weekly expenditure on fast food in Britain, and it shows in detail how much money people spend on fast food, thus indicating the prevailing trends in food consumption and the social and economic environment. It shows a steady increase in expenditure, especially since the early nineties. In the first years of the graph, the average weekly expenditure per person was relatively low, indicating a small degree of enthusiasm for fast food. However, as time goes by, the figure has increased considerably, especially in the late nineties and the first years of the twenty-first century. The chart also shows fluctuations in spending on fast food, and these fluctuations seem to follow a cyclical pattern. The peaks show periods of higher consumption of fast food. In contrast, the dips may be caused by a decline in fast-food consumption as a result of public health education campaigns. This trend is causing concern about the possible long-term health effects of frequent fast-food consumption by the younger generations. It is also worth noting the marked difference in spending on fast food between the younger and older generations. Younger people seem to prefer to spend more money on fast food than older people, who probably spend more on home-cooked and healthier foods. This increasing trend in fast-food spending highlights the need for more public debate on diet and nutrition. In conclusion, the data in the chart not only reveal trends in British fast-food consumption, but also point to the social, economic, and health factors that influence food choices.
96;The chart below shows the expenditure on three categories among different age groups of residents in the UK in 2004.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of total allocation of expenses in three major categories among the citizens of the United Kingdom from five different age groups in the year 2004.Overall, the spending on food and drink continuously increased as the residents reached the older ages. Moreover, spending on entertainment activities also incresased but declined when reaching the later age, while going to a restaurant and hotel was its peak during early age and its lowest was upon reaching the retirement age.Food and drink are part of our daily necessisties, and as a family member grows in number, the more food and drink a family consumed. Over other categories, food and drink are more essential and priority of every residents as the total spending of it increased every fifteen years. This explains why the total expenditure of residents in the UK is mostly on food and drink. From age under 30 with almost 7% only, it sharply increased up to 23% in age 76 and above.In addition, expenses on entertainment reached its peak level of 23%, the same percentage with food and drink but in different age goup, in 61 to 75. In this stage, people already reached the retirement age wherein entertainment activities became a hobby while still having energy. But upon reaching 76 years and above, it declined to just 13%. However, expenditure in eating on a restaurant and staycation on a hotel were high with 14% under 30 years of age, while it dramatically decreased to below 3% upon reaching 61 to 75 years of age.;" The first observation is that food expenditure accounted for a large part of the spending budget for the youngest age group (18–24). Looking at the chart in detail, the second observation is that the differences in spending between the two groups may be explained by differences in lifestyle. On the other hand, food expenditures gradually decreased as the age of the residents increased; for example, the elderly group (over 65) spent only about one fifth of their budget on food, which suggests a shift in priorities. This group spent about thirty per cent of its budget on food, which seems reasonable in view of the likely limits on the incomes of young people. One can notice, however, that the share of housing costs in the spending budgets of younger people gradually increased in the middle age groups, rising to more than thirty per cent for those aged 45–54. The second most important category is housing, and this is where the picture becomes more complex. This trend continued with the 55–64 age group but was slightly lower in the oldest group, perhaps due to the need to move to a smaller home or to downsize. The rise may be explained by the family responsibilities and the need for larger accommodation. On the whole, the chart reveals a distinct change in the priorities of different age groups in the UK in 2004 with regard to food, accommodation and entertainment. The younger group (18–24) spent about fifteen per cent of its budget on entertainment, which was significantly higher than the budget of the oldest group (over 65) which spent only five per cent. This decline in spending as people aged probably reflects changing priorities, as well as the more leisured lifestyles associated with old age. The data presented above reflects the changing spending habits associated with age."
984;The chart below shows the results of a survey of people who visited four types of tourist attraction in Britain in 1999.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The pie chart on the left shows the distribution of visitors to four types of tourist attractions in the year 1999 in Britain. This pie chart shows that most visitors are attracted by the Theme Parks and Museums & Galleries, which attracted 38% and 37% of visitors. Historic Houses and Monuments attract 16% of the visitors. Wildlife Parks and Zoos have the least attractions to visitors, which is only 9%. Besides the pie chart, there is a table that shows which part of the Theme parks people like to visit. The most popular place is the Blackpool Pleasure Beach which 47% of people visit. Besides Blackpool Pleasure Beach, other parts of the Theme Parks attraction similar percentage of visitors. The Alton Towers attracted 17% of visitors and Pleasureland, Southport attracted 16%. Both Chessington World of Adventures and Legoland, Windsor attract 10% of the people. This is the distribution of visitors to different types of tourist attractions in Britain, 1999, and the distribution of where visitors like to go in the Theme Parks.; This chart shows how many people visit the different types of tourist attraction in Britain. In 1999 museums were the most popular, attracting nearly 4.5 million visitors. The next most popular type of tourist attraction was historic houses, with more than two and a half million visitors. This is probably because of the interest in historic buildings, the architectural beauty of their buildings, and their history. Amusement parks seem to be of slightly wider appeal, perhaps because of their family atmosphere and their enticing rides, but they do not offer the cultural value that museums do, as can be seen from the difference in visitor numbers. In contrast, the popularity of amusement parks and animal parks was significantly lower, with about one and a half million and one million visitors respectively. These figures show that there is a strong preference for cultural and historical experiences amongst tourists, which can be seen from the high numbers of visitors to museums and historic houses. Amusement and animal parks, although popular, attracted considerably fewer visitors. Perhaps the interest in these tourist attractions is more specialist than that of the others, as animal parks usually offer a chance to see the animals in a more natural environment. A high percentage of tourists who visited these tourist attractions did so in order to have an educational experience.
450;The chart below shows the total number of Olympic medals won by twelve different countries.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The chart compares the number of medals won by 12 countries in Olympics. In brief, USA won the biggest amount of medalls overall and in each category followed by Soviet Union and UK. The difference between USA and Soviet Union is much bigger than between Soviet Union and UK, more than 2000 medals for USA, 1000 for Soviet Union and more than 500 for UK. France, Germany and Italy also passed the freshhold of 500 medals, closely followed by Sweden and Hungary with less than 500 medals. Australia follows Sweden with the same amount of silver and bronze medals but fewer gold. East Geramny has the same amount of gold medals, but fewer amount of silver and bronze than Hungary. The smallest amount of medals was won by Japan and China. The major trend for all the countries is that all types of medals: gold, silver and bronze are close to being proportionate to one another.; The chart shows the performance of a number of countries, showing their physical power on a world scale. In the first place is the United States of America, with more than two thousand five hundred medals, which is the most successful country in Olympic history. The second is the Soviet Union with over a thousand medals, despite its disintegration in 1991, the country has performed very well, especially in strength sports and running. The USA has the most developed sports facilities in the world, and its athletes have dominated many disciplines, especially in swimming, gymnastics and athletics. A further three countries, Great Britain, Germany and France have performed well with medals in the range of eight hundred to nine hundred. China is the third with more than two thousand medals, especially in gymnastics, swimming and table tennis, where the country has had state sponsorship. On the other hand, a number of countries, such as New Zealand and the Netherlands, have performed well in relation to their small populations, demonstrating that with dedicated resources and early talent spotting, it is possible to achieve at the very highest level. On the other hand, Italy and Japan, who have a long history in Olympic competitions, have also performed well. Despite the dominance of a few countries in Olympic history, the chart also shows the widespread spread of athletic talent, demonstrating the competition among countries for Olympic glory.
1100;The chart shows the number of mobile phones and landlines per 100 people in selected countries.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information given.;The bar chart illustrates the information on the number of people who are using mobile phones and landlines per 100 people in 7 different countries.Overall, the total number of mobile phones per 100 people are higher than land line. Among the countries, Italy is one of the country that uses the highest number of mobile phones per 100 people.More specifically, 90 phones are used per 100 people in Italy, followed by Sweden and the UK at close to 90 and 85 phones respectively. From the figure, mobile phones were least popular in Canada, approximately 40 per cent of the people carry mobile phones which the percentage of mobile phone users are lower than one-half users in Italy.On the other hand, land lines are mostly loved in Denmark at 85 and 90 per cent. However, most other countries remain between 55 to 70 per cent. Interestingly, Italy has the least proportion of users having just over 40 phones per 100 people.; It is clear that the number of mobile connections is much higher than that of landlines in most of the countries. For example, in the US and in South Africa, there are more than ninety mobile connections per hundred people, while the penetration of landlines is significantly lower, reflecting the global trend of a mobile phone. In Japan and Germany, landline connections are still quite common, exceeding fifty per hundred people, which may reflect historical trends, financial resources and cultural preferences, and is still able to stay relevant to the overall communication environment, despite the declining trend of the world. This trend may be due to the advantages of mobile phones, such as their convenience, easy access and low cost. However, it should also be noted that the penetration of mobile phones is increasing in some emerging countries, and the gap between the penetration of landlines and mobile phones is widening. During the development of telecommunications in Africa and Southeast Asia, the role of landline phones may have declined. This trend will have far-reaching consequences for economic development, social interactions and access to information, and this trend must be closely watched as the global trend develops. In short, the trend in the above chart not only reflects the trend of landline to mobile phone connections in various countries, but also reflects the technological progress and changes in the market.
414;The chart shows the unemployment situation in Australia in the year 2012.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The line chart compared the percentage of people unemployed in Australian rural and urban areas in 2012. Overall, the two kinds of areas presented the opposite trends through the four quarters, with the number in urban areas rising and that of rural areas declining.Urban areas witnessed a considerable fluctuation throughout the whole timeframe. At the start of the first quater, unemployment rate in urban areas started low at slightly over 2%. The percentage climbed steadily and reached its first peak at the end of the second season at about 4%. However, it dropped to the start point again during the third, and continued to rise after that, closing the year at another new record at nearly 5%.On the other hand, rural areas demonstrated a more consistent change. Beginning significantly higher than urban areas at around 6.5%, its unemployment rate dropped to only 4.5% after the first two seasons. Although there were some fluctuations, the gap between rural and urban areas gradually narrowed down. The final unemployment rate for rural areas was 5%, decreasing by 1.5% compared to the start.; An analysis of the chart will show trends and differences between the various groups. The unemployment rate in Australia in 2012 was 5.5%. This is lower than the rate in all the other countries of the world, and especially youth has a higher unemployment rate than other groups. This suggests that the young are more difficult to employ because of their lack of experience, and also because there are fewer opportunities for them to enter the work force. The chart also shows that the unemployment rate for men is slightly higher than that for women, at around 6% compared to 5%. On the other hand, the unemployment rate for older workers, especially those over 45 years old, is lower, and at around 3.5%. This suggests that the older workers are more successful in finding work and are less inclined to lose their jobs. Besides that, the unemployment situation varies geographically. For example, the unemployment rate in Tasmania was 7.6%, while in Western Australia it was only 4.4%. This could mean that especially in construction and manufacturing, which are industries where men are dominant, the economy is suffering from the fluctuations in the year 2012. This also points to the need for targeted policies to improve employment prospects for the young, while at the same time recognizing the more stable employment situation for older workers. In conclusion, the unemployment situation in Australia in 2012 was characterized by marked differences between age, gender and geography.
556;The charts below compare the age structure of the populations of France and India in 1984.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;These bar charts illustrate different ages categories from 0-5 years old to over 70 of people living in France and India during the year of 1984.Overall, France population ages present various percentages not over 4% between males and females, whereas in India with the increase of age the percentages decreased gradually.Firstly, a bulk of population in France from 10-15 to 30-35 age category of males and females had the highest averages with almost 3,5%, whereas from 40-45 to 60-65 reached approximately 2,7%. By contrast it is noticeable that from 70-75 to 80-85 females were around only the half of the total percentage and males no more than 1%.Secondly, In india the highest proportion of population is the young of 0-5 to 15-20 with nearly 7% and 6% respectively. Moreover, the medium categories both males and females that represent the half of the total percentages is 30-35 to 50-55. By contrast, it is clearly seen that the over 60 population reached just no more than 3%.; In France, the distribution of age was relatively even in 1984, with a marked bias towards the middle ages. The ages of the French population are shown in the table. The French population in the age distribution showed a higher level of maturity than the Indian population. It was due to the lower birth rate and longer life expectancy in France, so there were more adults and a relatively smaller number of children and old people. In France, the 0-14 age group was 21.7% of the population and the 15-64 age group was 72.7%. The elderly population was 7%. In contrast, the population of India in 1984 was heavily concentrated in the younger age groups. The 0-14 age group was 38.5% of the population, indicating a large birth rate and a large youth population, and the 15-64 age group was 55.5%, and the population of those over 65 was only 4%. These differences in age distribution showed different social, economic and medical problems in each country. France, with an aging population, faces the problems of pensions and health care for the elderly. India, with its young population, faces the problems of high birth rates and small elderly populations. This difference reveals some of the possibilities for future policies and programmes. In France, the distribution of ages shows the emergence of a mature society, whereas India, with a young population, faces the problems of providing employment, education and health care for its large young population.
936;The charts below give information about the way in which water was used in different countries in 2000.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;One of the given chart depicts the use of water in the world, in 2000, for Industry, domestic use and Agriculture.The second chart describes the water consumption by countries ( Canada, New Zealand, India and China) for the same three sectors. Units are measured in percentage.Overall, the larger quantity of water use if for Agriculture ( 70% ) followed by the industry ( 22%) and finally the domestic use representing only 8%.Among the four countries, India is the biggest consumer of water for agriculture with 92%, China also has a significant use of water in that sector with 69%. on the other hand water use in Agriculture counts for less than 50% for both New Zealand and Canada ( with 44% and 8 percent respectively).When it comes to industry, Canada is the larger water consumer hiting a high of 80% while the three other countries have small to very small percentage of water use in that field. ( China 22%, New Zealand 10% and India 3%).Finally use of water for domestic purpose represent less than 50% for all 4 countries. New Zealand 46%, Canada 12%, China 9% and India 5% . However it is important to mention taht for New Zealand, consumption of water in represents the larger part of water use.; In the given article the distribution of water usage in various countries is shown, including the United States, Brazil, China and India. Water usage in agriculture was the highest in most countries, but there were differences in each country. This means that agriculture plays a major role in the economies of these two countries, where a large part of the population works in agriculture. In particular, India shows that agriculture is the largest use of water in India, which is probably because India is a mainly agricultural country. China also shows the great importance of agriculture with 69% of water consumption. But the United States shows that the water consumption is quite evenly distributed. Although agriculture still accounted for 39% of the total water consumption, industry used 48% of water, showing a more balanced distribution. All the countries used a small amount of water in the household, compared to the water used in agriculture and industry. Brazil is like the United States in that industrial water consumption was only 20% and agricultural water usage was 55%, but agricultural use was even more important in Brazil than in the United States, because the country has depended on the production of natural resources for its economic development. In general, the figures show that there are large differences in the way water is used in the countries. The economy and the development level of the countries are the main factors in water usage. In particular, the United States showed that domestic use was highest in the United States with 13% of water consumption.
350;The charts below show the percentage of Australian men and women in three age groups who were employed in 1984, 2001 and 2014.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The charts demonstrate the percentages of men and women aged 15-19, 35-44 and 60-64 working in Australia in 1984, 2001 and 2014.In 1984, the percentage of employed men aged 35-44 was alomst 100%. Similarly, that was the percentage of men aged 35-44 being employed in 2001 and 2014. As for employed men aged 15-19 we can see a slight decrease over the years, in 1984 more than 50% of men aged 15-19 were employed. However, in 2014, the percentage of employed men was exactly 50%. The percentage of men aged 60-64 being employed in 1984 was below 50% and remained similar to 2001. In 2014 we can see an increase in the percentage of workng males aged 60-64.The most obvious trend in the chart of employed women is the increase in employment over the years, especially women aged 35-44.Overall, we can see that the percentage of employed men in Australia hasn't increased as much as the percentage of employed women.; In the 15 to 24 age group, employment of both men and women fell over the three-decade period. In 1984, for example, there were about 69 per cent of young men in the workforce, but in 2014 this had dropped to 57 per cent. This might suggest that the percentage of young men wishing to study or take up some other pursuit is increasing, which might lead to lower employment rates in the group. The percentage of young women in the workforce also fell over the three decades, from 54 per cent in 1984 to 43 per cent in 2014. On the other hand, employment in the 25 to 54 age group has increased. In 1984, for example, there were about 92 per cent of men in the workforce, and in 2014 this figure had risen to 94 per cent. In this age group, the percentage of women in the workforce has also risen, from 60 per cent in 1984 to 70 per cent in 2014. This might be a result of women wishing to work, but also keeping their family responsibilities in mind. And finally, the percentage of women in the 55 and over age group has also risen, from 15 per cent in 1984 to 25 per cent in 2014. All in all, the graphs show a significant change in the Australian workforce: a fall in youth employment, increasing employment of middle-aged women and a gradual increase in employment of the older generation. These trends are possibly a result of changing societal and economic conditions, which have affected the workforce over the three decades.
1024;The charts below show the results of a questionnaire that asked visitors to the Parkway Hotel how they rated the hotel's customer service. The same questionnaire was given to 100 guests in the years 2005 and 2010.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;"The charts illustrate the outcome of a survery conducted among 100 Parkway Hotel's clients about the customer service's quality (from excellent to very poor) in 2005 and 2010.Overall, in this period of 5 years a growth of good and excellent judgements was seen, linked to a fall of the bad ones.In 2005, almost the half of the visitors (45%) judged the service satisfactory.In addition, 14 out of 100 believed that the service provided by the Hotel was good, while only 5/100 thought it was excellent.However, for the 36% it was below the standard level, and in particular for 15 of them it was very poor.In the first decade of 2000 the service was judged above the average by most of the visitors; in fact, 39% said it was good, whereas 28% stated that it was excellent.Furthermore, since 12% outlined a poor quality of the customer service and only 4% a very poor one, a noticeable decrease of bad reviews was seen."; The question was posed in five categories: excellent, good, satisfactory, poor and very poor. The data for the year 2005 showed that customer satisfaction was extremely high, with 38% of guests rating the service as excellent and 28% good. By comparison, only 4% found the service very poor, 13% poor and 20% satisfactory. So the overall response was 66%. The percentage of excellent responses had fallen dramatically to 29%. The percentage of good responses increased to 39%. In essence, the result is that the percentage of excellent responses has fallen slightly, while the percentage of good and satisfactory responses has risen. In this way, the data shows that fewer guests find the service to be excellent, but more find it satisfactory, which leads to an overall score of 68%. The percentages of poor and very poor remained at a very low level. The fall in the percentage of excellent responses could be a sign that the Parkway Hotel needs to improve some of the factors that lead to this decline in excellent ratings, if it is to remain competitive in the hospitality industry.
796;The charts show information concerning speed-camera use, together with statistics on road accidents, for the city of Melbourne.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;These charts depicts the proprtion of using speed- camera and road accidents percentages in Melbourne. It is clear from the graphs that the number of speed- cameras had increaded significantly over the period of 2022 and 2005.According to what is shown, the percentage of accidents was flactuated between 2002 and 2004 until it sharply rised in 2005. on the other hand, the death rate was steady between 2002 and 2003 then it sharply increaded in the period between 2004 and 2005. After that it dropped in 2005. In addition acciedent rate was much higher than the death rate. In 2004, the accident and death perentages increased abviously.To sum up, we could say that, the number of speed- camers in melborn had rised from about 45% to 148% from 2002 and 2005. Also, the accidents rate increaded over the same period of time. while the death rate decreased by 2005.; First, the chart below shows that the use of speed-cameras has increased considerably over the last five years. Secondly, the data reveals an interesting trend between the use of speed-cameras and the frequency of accidents. Specifically, the number of operational speed-cameras has risen steadily, indicating a determination to reduce speeding and to improve road safety. In contrast, the accident figures for the same period have fallen. The development of speed-cameras thus appears to have become a priority for police, suggesting that the authorities have adopted a more pro-active approach to road safety. Finally, the data also indicates that the most substantial fall in road accidents coincided with the periods of greatest speed-camera activity, indicating a positive correlation between the use of speed-cameras and a reduction in road accidents. The data also shows a marked decrease in accidents, including minor incidents, which is presumably a consequence of the increased visibility of speed-cameras. In this respect, the authorities have taken positive steps to curb speeding, thus improving road safety and encouraging drivers to obey the speed limits. It is noteworthy that the most significant falls in accidents occurred during the periods of greatest expansion of the speed-camera program, which further supports the argument that the implementation of this measure has had a positive impact on road safety. In conclusion, the chart from Melbourne provides persuasive evidence that increased use of speed-cameras has contributed to a fall in road accidents. Such information can prove useful for city planners and policy-makers who seek to further improve road safety in urban areas.
810;The charts show survey results concerning why MBA graduates chose their degree, and employer's reasons for hiring them.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The pie charts provide data about survey outcomes related to reasons of MBA graduates to chose a degree, and why employers decide to hire them.Overall, Most graduates are inclined to MBA's becuse of the better jobs opportunities. Whereas, employers have the pie divide into almost equally parts for what they value most. However, qualifications play the most insignificant role when chosing an employee.Within the reasons for doing an MBA, better job opportunities is hugely the common reason with sixty five tenths. However, othrr reasons such ability to do job better, personal development and ability to help others occuped the 15%, 12% and 8% of the pie respectively.In the second pie, what employers value most is divided into slices almost similar, 25% for personality and previous experience, then 20% for presentation and connections. Nonetheless, the least siginificant attribute is qualifications with only ten tenths of the pie.In comparison. Whereas the reasons for doing and MBA are unequally divided, the second pie chart presents quite similar percentages within the slices.; According to the survey, the main reason graduates choose to do an MBA is a desire to progress in their careers. This was the reason given by 40% of graduates surveyed. Examining these results can reveal a strong correlation between what students are looking for from an education and what companies are looking for from new graduates. Another third of graduates, about a fifth, chose an MBA because they wanted to build their business network, which reflects the growing importance of connections in the business world. The most common reason, however, was the desire to develop specialist knowledge and skills, given by 30% of graduates. In addition, a fifth of graduates wanted to do an MBA to further their personal development, demonstrating the value of a degree in business. In contrast, employers cite different reasons for hiring new graduates. The main reason, given by 35% of employers, was that they were looking for graduates with excellent problem-solving skills. Another common reason was the ability to work well with others. The desire to build their business network was given by a tenth of graduates as a reason for choosing an MBA. On the other hand, a fifth of employers put less emphasis on specialist knowledge and skills than graduates do. In the end, however, while graduates are most concerned with career progression and gaining specialist knowledge, employers place more emphasis on a graduate's ability to work well with others. This difference highlights the importance of developing these skills to further personal and professional development.
830;The charts show the amount and quality of water supplied to two regions of the world.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant;The left graph illustrates the percentages of the people supplied with water in Australia, and South East Asia. The orange bars show the percentages in 1990, and the green bars show the percentages in 2010. The right graph illustrates the percentages of degrees of its cleanliness in those countries. The yellow bars show the percentages in 1990, and the purple bars shows the percentages in 2010.In Australia, 80% of people got supplied with water in 1999, and it increased to nearly 100% in 2020. In South East Asia, less than 40% of people got water supply, and then the percentage in 2010 became doubled.Whereas degrees of its cleanliness, in Australia it was 70 % in 1990, and slightly increased to above 80% in 2010. In contrast, in South East Asia, the number of percentage was 40% in 1990, but it got small drop to below 40%.; The two regions receiving water from the city of New York are in a way as two different regions. In terms of quantity, Region A gets a much higher amount of water than Region B, about 200 million liters per day, whereas the supply to Region B is significantly lower, about 80 million liters per day. When the data is analyzed, one can see that there are significant differences in both the quantity and quality of water available, indicating significant differences in the availability of water resources in the two regions. As for quality, the graphs show a clear difference between the two regions, with Region A having treated water in excess of 90 per cent, and therefore suitable for consumption. This contrast indicates a potential limitation for Region B in terms of meeting its water needs, with the potential consequence on health, agriculture and overall quality of life. Moreover, while Region A seems to have established a well-functioning system of water treatment and distribution, Region B seems to be struggling to establish sufficient procedures to ensure water quality. Region B, on the other hand, receives only about 60 per cent of treated water. As a result, there are concerns about the safety of water in Region B, as the untreated water may lead to health problems and lower living standards. This is because not only does Region A achieve higher water volumes but also makes a large proportion of its water supply safe for consumption. This situation can be caused by various factors, such as budgetary considerations, policies, or a lack of development in water treatment and distribution. This comparison highlights the need for targeted measures to improve water management and distribution in less affluent regions. However, Region B has to face both the quantity and quality, and these may affect the well-being of its people.
426;The charts shows air pollution levels by different causes among four countries in 2021.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the level of air pollution caused by three different sectors namely electricity generation, transport and industry among four countries which are China, America, Japan and Australia in 2021.Overall, it can be seen that China produced the highest amount of the pollution in every sector. Another noticeable point is that all causes in Australia created the pollution at almost the same amount.Looking at the detail, the industry, the transportation and the electricity generation in China generated the pollution level of 80, 70 and a little less than 60 ppm respectively. This pattern also occurred in Japan where the industry ranked first in releasing the pollution (above 40 ppm) and the power generation ranked last (produced around 15 ppm).Furthermore, approximately 60 ppm of the pollution in Australia is arisen from the electricity generation and the industry. This generated pollution of each aforementioned factors accounted for about 30 ppm which is nearly two times less than that of the transport. Focusing further on Australia, all three businesses created the pollution of just below 20 ppm.; It is obvious that in the four countries, industrial waste and transport are the main sources of air pollution, although their impacts vary considerably. Country A has the highest overall air pollution level, with industry accounting for nearly half of its total emissions. Country B, on the other hand, has the lowest pollution level, and its biggest source of pollution is from transport, accounting for 40% of its emissions. This suggests a greater reliance on manufacturing and industry, which will lead to significant harm to the environment. One further interesting observation is the contribution of agriculture to air pollution. This is very clear in Country C, where agriculture accounts for 15% of emissions, whereas in the other countries this is much lower, perhaps indicating a difference in the scale or practice of agriculture. Country C and D had more balanced distributions, with the industry attributing to its pollution levels at 30% and transport to 25%. The figures highlight the need for national policies that address the unique sources of air pollution in each country and reduce its impact on the environment. In summary, while industrial waste is the main cause of pollution in Country A, countries B, C and D are more affected by transport and home heating.
1112;The climograph below shows average monthly temperatures and rainfall in the city of Kolkata.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The graphic gives information about Kolkata's monthly temperatures and rainfall. There is a big discrepancy in the rainfall over the year, and summer months are those in which it rains the most. By contrast, the temperature is almost stable over the months although May is the hottest.There is a huge discrepancy in the rainfall over the year. There are months in which the millimeters of precipitation are higher and others in which they are almost zero. During the first three months of the year there are few precipitations. The rainfalls start sligtly to increase and, In particular, during the summer, from June to Septemper, it rains in large quantities. In July and August the millimeters of precipitation are almost 350. Instead, the colder months are less rainy. The millimiters of precipitations start decrease after August and they plummet down at the end of September. Indeed, the rainfall are almost zero from November to Jenuary.The temperature is almost stable during the year. It is never cold in Kolkata, rather the temperature is always around 20 C. May is the warmer month and the temperature exceeds 30C. By contrast, December and Jenuary are the coldest, although there are around 20C. The temerature start to go up in February whereas around August a decreasment is registered.; Kolkata has a hot, wet and dry climate with a hot, humid summer, a wet monsoon season and a cool winter. The graph shows that temperatures rise from April to July, and in the months of May and June they are usually over thirty-four degrees centigrade. Then they fall dramatically between December and January to fifteen and twenty degrees centigrade, showing the extremes of the city’s climate and providing some relief from the heat of summer. The humidity of the air is high, making it even more unbearable. When the monsoon season starts, in June, the temperature begins to rise again, and the graph shows that the wettest month is July with over three hundred millimetres of rain. The temperature rises again, slowly, between February and March, gradually reaching the summer peaks in April. Then it falls sharply between October and November and drops off completely in the winter months. This period gives most of the city’s annual rainfall and affects the weather pattern considerably. Understanding the interplay between temperature and rainfall is crucial to the city’s economy, agriculture and its response to climate change.
433;The dangers of smoking are well known, yet many people continue with this habit.What are the causes of this? How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is very easy to find someone who smokes in today's society. Even though we were taught that smoke is harmful, we see people exhaling this thick fog everyday partly because some people think that it is cool and it can be purchased almost at every store. This essay will discuss deeply about what causes people to smoke and how this issue can be alleviated.Firstly, part of the society believes that it is trendy to smoke. In many pop culture, such as songs, movies, and novels portray smoking possitively. A comedy show that I have seen illustrates one of the character that smokes to be more cool, giving this character an untouchable aura, whilst other characters that did not smoke seem tangible and therefore mundane. Furthermore, cigarettes are easily accessable in any store. A recent study proved that over 80% of those eager to smoke for the first time actually started this behavior because they can buy it from their local shops. The trend from pop culture and the convenience in accessing smoke adds up to the reasons why some people continues with this habit.I believe that there are solutions that can tackle and reduce smoking, beginning with medias should portray smoking to have consequences that are relatable. A movie I have seen showed the protagonist's constant need for cigarette throughout the show. However, in the end when he finally unites with his crush, he develops a severe disease, mainly from his smoking habits, in which he regretted in the end. This method of portraying people who smoke totally made my younger niece scared of smoking. In addition, government should control the accessibility of cigarettes. Policies that result and fewer stores being able to sell cigarettes and increasing tax pricing of smoke of any kind will definitely make smoking less convenient for many people.In conclusion, although many people knew how harmful smoking is, many people think it is cool to smoke and it is convenient and easy to buy. By making smoking less trendy in society and harder to access, I believe that smoking will be less attractive, hence reducing the number of smokers in society.; There are a number of reasons why people continue to smoke. One is addiction. It is necessary to understand the reasons for continuing to smoke in order to make a difference to public health. Many people begin smoking in their teens, under peer pressure, with a desire to fit in with the group. The influence of parents, relatives and friends is a strong stimulus to this addiction. Nicotine, the main substance in tobacco, creates a powerful addiction and makes it very difficult to break the habit. Another important reason is that smoking provides a coping mechanism to help people deal with stress, depression or other emotional problems. People are less likely to seek coping strategies in healthier ways, which increases the chances of becoming addicted. Public health campaigns, encouraging smokers to give up, raise awareness and help them to quit smoking. Taxes on tobacco, bans on advertising and smoke-free areas, aimed at deterring the onset of smoking, also help to prevent it and encourage smokers to stop. To reduce smoking in society, a variety of strategies must be used. Firstly, there should be easily accessible support for those who want to give up, such as counselling and nicotine replacement therapy. Also, the development of a supportive community for those trying to give up is necessary. For example, Australia has successfully banned the advertising of tobacco products and cigarettes are sold only in plain packaging. This has created a smoke-free culture and the lower smoking rates are evident. In conclusion, while the dangers of smoking are well known, there are many factors which influence the continuation of this habit.
496;The diagram below show the development of the horse over a period of 40 million years. The evolution of the horse, with particular emphasis on the changing foot structure.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram illustrates the evolution of the horse in terms of their foot structure over a 40 million year period. Overall, the horse's were divided into four stages of development, starting from a period of 40 million years ago until now, with a 10 to 15 million year gap approximation in between.To begin with, 40 million years ago, the Eohippus, which was the first developmental stage of a horse's foot structure was similar to the bone structure of a human's hand. However, they branch out into five toes while travelling on foot. Then, during stage 2 of the horse's foot development, which was 10 million years later, the horse evolved into a Mesohippus. With regards to the structure of its toe, it was reduced from the original five into three. In addition, the middle toe had a larger foot structure compared to other other two.Next, 15 million years later, came the evolution of a Merychippus from a Mesohippus. Similarly, the foot structure was identical to the Mesohippus' horse but did not have the middle toe's length significantly longer than the other two. Although the middle toe was thicker than before, it became more even in terms of its length comparison to its other two toes. Finally, the emergence of the final evolution of the horse in modern days. With regards to the foot structure, it no longer branched out into several toes as it used to be, but is shaped like a tree branch with a rounded bases on the bottom of the foot.; As you can see in the diagram, the horse has undergone a remarkable transformation in its 40 million years of existence, beginning with the hyracotheriums, a small dog-like horse with a disproportionately large number of toes on each foot, typically four in front and three in back. Starting with the Hyracotheriums, the horse has gone through a series of significant anatomical changes, especially in its feet, resulting from its adaptation to different environments. For example, the Hyracotheriums had a small number of toes on their feet, which provided good grip and stability in the forest where they lived, but as the environment changed and grasslands developed, the need for faster movement led to further anatomical changes. In the Oligocene, the horse genus Mesohippus appeared with longer legs and fewer toes. On the Miocene transition, the genus Merychippus showed further development, with a more pronounced hoof and three toes on each foot. These changes in the foot structure allowed the horse to run faster, increasing its escape capability. In conclusion, the evolution of the horse has brought about a significant change in foot structure from its multi-toed ancestors to the modern horse with its one hoof. This adaptation to the grassland environment not only enabled faster running, but also made it easier to carry the weight of the horse over longer distances. Finally, the modern horse, Equus, completed this process with a well-developed hoof, which gave maximum speed and efficiency and minimized the energy used for movement. This explains the horse's success in survival over millions of years.
700;The diagram below shows how Olive Oil is manufactured.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information below.;The Olive Oil is manufactured through several ways. First of all, the olives are picked from the trees by the farmers. Then the fresh olives are rinished using the cold water. The machines used are specific and it helps belt to smash the olives. After smashed, the olives become either olive paster or the olive stones. The next step is to put those into a bag with holes. Moving onto the next step, it will be pressed by a certain pressurer. It gives a great amount of weight on the olives so that it can be well pressed. Moreover it will be separated into either oil or water. Then, it will be stored and sold to the consumers. Thus, it is quite apparent that olive oil is manufactured by specific steps. And so more, olive oil is widely used as it is a good source for the chefs when cooking.; First of all, the harvesting of olives begins, which is usually done in the late autumn and winter. The diagram below shows the various stages from harvesting the olives to bottling the oil. The olive oil manufacturing process is both complex and ancient and consists of several steps. After the olives are harvested, the olives are cleaned by removing branches, leaves and other rubbish, preparing them for the next stage. The olives are collected either by hand or mechanically to avoid damage. This is essential to prevent a drop of oil from spoiling. This is called 'milling'. This is done by a machine called a millstone or steel roller. This is an important stage of the process as it helps the olives to release the oil. The next stage is 'malaxation', in which the paste is slowly stirred for twenty to forty minutes. After this, the paste is transferred to the 'separation phase', in which the oil is separated from the paste. This can be done by a mechanical press or by a centrifuge which spins at high speed to separate the liquid oil from the solid residue. The mixing helps to mix the small oil droplets together to increase the extraction rate. Finally, the extracted oil is bottled and labelled for distribution. This completes the manufacture of olive oil. To sum up, the manufacture of olive oil involves several steps, including the harvesting, cleaning, milling, mixing, separation and bottling of the olives. Each of these steps is essential for the quality and authenticity of the final product.
538;The diagram below shows how avocado oil is extracted.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant. You should write at least 150 words.;The two images presented give information regarding the gender and age of attenders of some eductional courses in 2009.Overall, with the exception of sculpture courses, female is the dominant gender among the people who attended these evening courses. Moreover, most individuals were senior people, meaning they are 50 years old or older.Beginning with language courses, there were exactly 40 women in these courses, where there were only 20 men in the same. Sculpture courses, the least attended, has around 5 women and 10 men. Painting courses, however, were visited by 30 women and approximately 24 men. Lastly, 20 women and 10 men decided to be visitors of the drama evening courses.In terms of age diversification, 42 percent of attenders were old people, and only 5 percent of them were young people. Furthermore, 11 percent ranged from 20 to 29 years old, and 42 percent of all attenders aged between 20 and 49.; It all starts with the selection of ripe avocados, which are washed to remove any dirt. Then they are cut in half and the stone is taken out by hand. The flesh of the avocados is then squeezed out of the stone and this extract is milled and ground up to a smooth paste. The next stage is to heat the paste. The paste is then centrifuged, which is a crucial stage in the extraction of oil from the paste. After this, the oil is filtered to remove any solids or impurities, so that it is a pure oil. After the oil is extracted, it is bottled and sent out. In short, all the stages of the process help to ensure that the oil is pure and that it retains the flavour and nutrients for which it is so highly valued. It is important to note that the whole process does not involve the use of chemicals, as the natural extraction method ensures that the oil retains its quality. This is different from the extraction of many other oils, where the use of chemical solvents may be involved.
1156;The diagram below shows how coffee is produced and prepared for sale in supermarkets and shops.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram shows the process of coffee from production to preparing for sale in supermarkets and shops.Overall, it is certain that coffee goes through 11 different stages from picking the beans to packing in jars.Firstly, coffee beans are picked and then dried by humans. The dried beans are later roasted in a machine then in the blast freezer machine, it's cooled down rapidly. Furthermore, after cooling out they go through a grinding process where they turned into powder, then mixed with high-temperature water after a while, it goes from straining process.We are now arriving at the later process where coffee is now frozen in the refrigerator. In the third last stage, again it goes from the grinding process but this time it is frozen and after this, they put them in a vacuum machine where it evaporates the water from coffee to make them dry.Lastly, the coffee is ready to pack in the jar and ready to sell on the market.; The diagram shows the different stages in the process of coffee production. In the first place, coffee is grown in countries with a tropical climate, where the conditions for growing coffee plants are appropriate. When the beans are harvested, they are usually dried in the sun or in a dryer. Coffee is harvested mainly from the cherries, which are usually picked by hand because only the ripe cherries are used. After drying, the beans are sorted and sorted for quality control. They are then roasted in one of the methods that determine the taste of the coffee. After roasting, the beans are ground to the desired coarseness, which again depends on the type of brewing, whether it is espresso or ordinary filter coffee. Roasting may vary from light to dark depending on customer preferences. After grinding, the coffee is packed. The packages are moisture-proof to preserve the quality of the coffee during transportation and storage. In the end, the coffee is available to consumers in various shops and in supermarkets. This stage is very important for coffee because not only does it keep it fresh but also for marketing purposes by making the package and the logo. Each stage is precisely controlled and quality is ensured, which is very important for satisfying today's consumers' different tastes. This whole process from cultivation to trade shows how complex the preparation of a widely used beverage is.
618;The diagram below shows how ethanol fuel is produced from corn.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram illustrates that the process of corn which is formed into ethanol fuel with various kinds of steps from the starting point of Corn to the lasting point of Transporting.Overall, there are 3 main steps of processing from the beginning to the end. In the fourth section and sixth section, adding water and liquid is the most important part of these formed of fuel.On the first step, the corn will be stored and milling to be reached to cooking. It will need 4 hours times to be cooked and water would be added into the cooking. On the second, Fermenting will be hold on (48 hours) after the cooking levels of speed. Then, the separating time has arrived, within this process the liquid is then added into the solids of separating product.In the final steps, after (5 hours) time of mixing purifying ethanol will be get its point. Taking ethanol has stored after its purifying steps and then transporting in the surface area to get to ethanol fuel.; The diagram shows that the process of preparing ethanol fuel from corn involves several stages. The process starts with the planting and harvesting of corn, which is the main material for producing ethanol. Then the corn is taken to a milling plant where the corn is cleaned and ground. The ground corn is then mixed with water and heated to a temperature of 50°C to create a mash, which is a fermentable mixture. When the mash is cooled, it is mixed with special enzymes which break down the starches and convert them into sugars. The enzymatic process is important because the yeast needs sugars to ferment. At this stage, yeast is added to the mash, and the yeast consumes the sugar and produces ethanol and carbon dioxide in the course of a few days. The solid residue, known as distiller’s grains, is also an important material in the preparation of ethanol. As the solid material, it can be further processed and used as animal feed. After the fermentation, the mixture is distilled to separate the distilled spirits from the solid matter, then distilled spirits are dried to remove any remaining water, and the end result is a pure distilled spirit which can be used as fuel. This diagram shows clearly and simply how the process of preparing distilled spirits from corn can be done, and it also shows how the whole process of preparing the distilled spirits from corn can be combined to make a more sustainable and environmentally friendly way of producing a fuel.
298;The diagram below shows how oil is expected in use of production of perfumeSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The given process chart illustrates how perfume is obtained using oil as an ingredient. Overall, the product undergoes 4 main steps, which involve prevalently water and the usage of heating and cooling down methods, in addition to a separation machine, before being ready to be used to create a fragrance.For starters, the water is placed in a metal tank and brought to the boiling point through direct flames. Then, the steam is conducted by a pipe to another cistern, where aromatic plants are added, in order to obtain oil vapor mixed with steam.Right afterward, the mixture goes into a pipe system, where a condensation process takes place, thanks to a condenser that uses cold water. In doing so, the cold water flowing in the condenser absorbs the heat that comes from the pipe where the oil and water solution is. After that, water mixed with essential oil reaches the last tank, in which a separator proceeds to take essential oil apart. This way, only the aromatic water is able to proceed and it is possible to use it in the perfume industry.; The process of extracting and refining oil is a crucial part of the manufacture of perfumes with complex fragrances. The diagram shows the process of extracting oil from a perfume. Next, the oil is extracted and refined. After the extraction, the next process is to refine the oil. The oil is extracted from plants by several methods such as distillation, extraction and cold pressing. Each of these methods has a different effect on the quality and concentration of the oil. Then, to produce a particular fragrance, perfume manufacturers mix various essential oils in different proportions to obtain unique scents. It is also possible to add synthetic compounds to enhance or stabilize the fragrance, which makes it possible to offer consumers a wider variety of fragrances. In general, the diagram shows the systematized process from the collection of raw materials to the delivery of a finished product. After the oil has been mixed and refined, it must undergo strict quality control to ensure consistency and compliance with hygiene standards. Once the quality control is successful, the finished perfume is bottled and prepared for distribution. The mixture of natural oils and synthetic compounds clearly reveals the complexity of the process and the need for precision to obtain the desirable fragrances that define the perfume industry. Each step in the process is very important for the final product to be safe and safe for consumers.
38;The diagram below shows how rain water is collected and then treated to be used as drinking water in an Australian town. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;Information is presented in a diagram which depicts the main steps of rainwater treatment with the aim to produce drinking water in a particular town in Australia.Overall, it can be clearly seen that the process involves a number of complex stages starting from collecting rainwater, purification until getting the water as a final product.At the beginning of the process, rainwater is drained from a roof through a tube which is attached to each house. Then the water flow through the tube to a three-layer water filter which is the first step of water purification. After that, the filtered water is kept in a storage tank which is connected to a water treatment tank. As the water in the storage flows into the water treatment tank, it is mixed with chemicals, making this step as the final part of the process. Once the water is mixed, it flows from the water treatment tank to each house and is ready for drinking.; First of all rainwater is collected from the roofs and directed into a system of gutters. This system involves several important steps that ensure that water collected is safe for consumption. This initial stage of collection is crucial because it is the only way to collect and store enough water, especially during the dry seasons. The water then flows into a water tank which is a reservoir for rainwater collected. The water is then filtered and chlorinated. This treatment is necessary because it disinfects the water by killing harmful bacteria. This method of collecting and treating water is a sustainable one because it makes use of water collected locally rather than having to depend on a larger system. The final step is the distribution of the water through the pipes so that it is easily available to the residents of the town. The information in the diagram shows a comprehensive and efficient system for collecting and treating rainwater for drinking. It demonstrates the sustainable and safe way water is managed in this town.
472;The diagram below shows how solar panels can be used to provide electricity for domestic use.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram illustrates the production of electricity for domestic use by solar panels. Overall, electricity is provided after it has been processed using 5 equipments ( solar panels, inverter electrical panel, utility meter and utility grid).First of all, solar panels on the roof of a normal house receive and absorb energy from the sun and turn it into DC current. The second stage is that, the DC current is converted into AC current by using inverter, which controls the electricity and production. After that, once the solar electricity has been distributed to our homes, it is then flowed back to the grid through a utility meter.At the final stage of the process, a utility grid, which looks like a small electrical tower, provides electricity when an user uses extra amount than the amount produced by the solar panles. By these stages, electricity is produced and ready for domestic use.; You can mention the following components of the system: the solar panels themselves, which consist of photovoltaic (PV) cells. These components are responsible for the conversion of solar energy into electricity. The efficiency of the solar panels is largely dependent on the material they are made of – they are usually made of silicon, a material that can absorb and convert solar energy into electricity. These cells capture sunlight and convert it into direct current (DC) electricity. When the sunlight is converted into DC electricity, it is passed to the inverter. The diagram shows how the inverter is connected to the home's electrical system and how electricity from the inverter is distributed to all the appliances in the home. The inverter converts the direct current electricity generated by the panels into alternating current (AC) electricity, the standard form of electricity used in homes. Also indicated in the diagram is a battery storage system. This is a way for a household to make use of solar energy as its main source of electricity, but in addition, it allows it to feed back to the grid any surplus electricity it produces during the hours of peak sunlight, thus allowing a credit on future electricity bills. In summary, this diagram shows how solar energy can be converted into usable electricity for domestic purposes, and the combination of the solar panels, inverters, electrical distribution and battery storage systems, all working together to provide a sustainable solution to meet the energy needs of an increasingly green-minded society. The batteries make it possible to use the solar energy generated during the day, as well as night and cloudy days, thus making it a reliable and continuous source of electricity.
1082;The diagram below shows the average hours of unpaid work per week done by people in different categories. (Unpaid work refers to such activities as childcare in the home, housework and gardening.)Describe the information presented below, comparing results for men and women in the categories shown. Suggest reasons for what you see.;"The bar graph provides information regarding the average hours of uncompensated work done weekly by men and women in marriage. The data are categorised by the number of children that they have.Overall, it is clearly observed that as the number of children increases, so is the average of unpaid working hours per week for married women. However, the time spent in these hours of their male counterparts are stable. It is also seen that the females have more hours of uncompensated labour than the males.In detail, those females with 3 or more children have worked 60 hours per week without pay, which is by far the highest average hour compared to the other categories. The amount of time they spent with this type of work diminishes as the number of children becomes fewer; married females with 1 to 2 children have 10 hours less and those without children have 30 hours weekly.In regard with the type of gender, married males have lesser average hours of unpaid jobs than married females. The maried men have only less than 20 hours per week spent on this job, which is apporoximately just a half of the time spent in women with children. Moreover, the time spent for married men did not alter in the different given categories."; According to the diagram, women spend more hours on unpaid work than men. For example, in the category of caring for children, women spend an average of about 16 hours a week, while men spend only about 6. In the category of housework, women spend about 10 hours per week, while men spend about 4. The trend continues to the category of gardening, where men and women might work together as a family, with women spending about 3 hours per week and men only 2, showing that the responsibilities for raising children remain mostly with women. The responsibilities for unpaid work can also result from a traditional family arrangement where men are expected to work more in paid jobs. These trends are due to several factors in society. Also, a belief that women’s roles should be focused on child-rearing perpetuates the gender gap in unpaid work. The other main reason may be the relationship between paid and unpaid work. Since women tend to work less than men because they spend more time in unpaid work and work part-time, they spend more hours on domestic work. This means that there needs to be a fairer division of unpaid work in order to make domestic life more equal. In conclusion, the figures show a clear gender gap in the hours spent on unpaid work, and that the responsibilities for domestic work are still divided between men and women.
774;The diagram below shows the development of cutting tools in the Stone Age. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The diagram indicates the development of two cutting tools (Tool A and Tool B) in the Stone Age, from a front view, side view and back view. Tool A is a tool of 1.4 million years ago, whereas, Tool B is a cutting tool of 0.8 million years ago.Overall, Toll A and B were bigger than 5 cm long, were made of stone and were used in the Stone Age as cutting tools. Tool A had a triangular form, whilst, Tool B had a more complex form which is similar to a pentagon.In detail, the front view of Tool A seems rougher and with less sharpness than Tool B. Regarding the side view, the diagram shows that Tool A was wider than Tool B. Finally, the back view of Tool A shows that this device was thinner than Tool B's back view.To sum it up, these two cutting tools were similar in material and length. However, Tool B seems that it was a more developed tool, which was thinner in the side view and with a more complex form in its front and back view than Tool A.; The diagram shows three stages: the Old Stone Age (Paleolithic), the Middle Stone Age (Mesolithic), and the New Stone Age (Neolithic). The development of cutting tools during the Stone Age shows a significant change from a very simple to a more complex form. The main purpose of the early tools was to help with hunting and gathering, the mainstay of the primitive human economy. These tools, such as hand axes and butcher knives, were rudimentary, with designs that tended to be clumsy rather than efficient. But as the Stone Age progressed, more specialized tools were developed, such as knives and spearheads, made by a method known as pressure flaking. This method produced finer and sharper tools, which made them much more useful for butchery and other work. Since the introduction of agriculture, the tools needed to support it, and this showed the move from nomadic life to a more settled way of life. The greatest development came with the New Stone Age, when the tools were sharpened to make them even more useful, and they began to be used for different purposes, such as chopping, slicing, and grinding. Each of these stages reflected the changing needs and lifestyles of the prehistoric societies. In conclusion, the development of cutting tools in the Stone Age was gradual, but it did show a steady progression from simple and rough tools to specialized and refined ones, and it shows the increasing importance of agriculture and settled life.
586;The diagram below shows the development of cutting tools in the Stone Age. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The given map illustrates the changes of the village Chorleywood, located near London, whose population has grown since 1850.Overall, the structure of the village changed significantly from 1868 to 1994. It is clear that the village growth is particularly linked with the building of the motorway and the railway. The increased infrastructure shaped the layout of surrounded area.The village was situated on the main road and was comparatively small rom 1868 until 1883. However, from 1883 onwards, the village grew significantly on the southern side. This was due to the railway contstruction in 1909. The part around the Chorleyood Station got populated and stretched along the railroad until the 1970s.Another key factor of the development was the construction of the motorway in 1970. The motorway was build on the eastern side of the city and crossed the main road as well as the railway. This resulted in new developments around the newly built motorway on former unspoiled land, espescially the Chorleywood Park and Golf Course.; The Stone Age is divided into three phases, the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. In the Paleolithic period, the first stone tools were quite simple and made of flint. These tools, known as Oldowan tools, were used to butcher animals and to prepare food from plants. As society developed, so did technology, as shown by the introduction of the Acheulean handaxe. This development enabled groups to hunt in a more efficient way. The Mesolithic period saw an increase in the complexity of the tools made. The production of microliths, small flint tools, which were used as blades and mounted on wooden shafts, marked the introduction of composite tools. The Neolithic period saw the greatest developments. Tools, such as the cleaver and the millstone, became essential for farming. This development illustrates the crucial role of technological developments in the evolution of human society. Each of the three phases not only showed developments in materials and techniques, but also showed the changing life styles and diets of these early humans. The diagram shows a clear development from the primitive tools of the Paleolithic to the specialist agricultural tools of the Neolithic.
1038;The diagram below shows the life cycle of a salmon, from egg to adult fish.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram depicts the life-cycle of the salmon, from being an egg to transforming into a fully grown adult fish.The first stage of the salmon starts in the river, where the spawning of two mature salmons lead to the laying of eggs. The rivers have long been chosen by salmons for breeding spots because their fresh-saltless water is suitable for the eggs and the freshly hatched baby salmons to start maturing in. After emerging from the eggs, the hatchlings stay on in the fresh water till they pre-mature/partially grow. After gaining considerable size and adapting to the primary waters, they travel to the estuaries, the only stop-over between them and the oceans. Only the first of the young salmons to reach the estuaries are able to make it to the oceans. This is because once these small and stagnant water bodies get over-crowded, there is virtually no space left in them which in-turn leads to the death of many young salmons.The young salmons who were able to survive the estuaries journey to the oceans, where the salty water increases their size and makes them fully grown. After getting the maturity to breed, they go back to the rivers from where the cycle starts all-over again.In total, there are 8 stages in the life of a salmon to maturity, it starts in the rivers and ends in the rivers too.; The life cycle of the salmon begins when females lay thousands of eggs in gravel nests called redds, usually in fresh water streams and rivers. The life cycle of the salmon is a fascinating journey through many different stages. The salmon’s life cycle is divided into five main phases: egg, alevin, fry, smolt and adult. Following an incubation period lasting several weeks, the eggs hatch into alevins. During this period the alevins are still feeding on the yolk sac attached to their bodies and they remain in the gravel as they continue to grow. This is a critical period in the life of the young salmon, as they develop important survival skills and the physical attributes necessary for their survival. Once the alevins have absorbed the nutrients from their yolk sacs, they develop into fry, which are able to move freely and actively seek out food, such as small water insects and plankton, and they begin to develop the ability to adapt to their new environment. These fry grow and develop for several months before undergoing a significant transformation, as they prepare to migrate from fresh water to the sea. Smolt are small salmon that have hatched in fresh water and which are now ready to travel down rivers and enter the sea. This migration is a critical period for the young fish, as it enables them to access the vast sea food resources. Finally, after spending between one and five years at sea, the young fish develop into fully mature adult salmon, which return to the fresh water of their birthing rivers to reproduce, completing the life cycle. Each of the salmon’s life stages is characterised by critical adaptations that enable them to survive and reproduce. The remarkable journey the salmon take through its life stages clearly illustrates not only the adaptability and resilience of the salmon but also the complex interplay between the environment, the salmon’s development and its survival.
458;The diagram below shows the life cycle of the honey bee.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;Overall the cycle of life of the honey bee can be divided in 6 steps which can be grouped in 2 main stages: hatching and reaching for maturity. This process lasts around 34 to 36 days and it repeats itself over again.The cycle starts when female bees lay their eggs. They lay their eggs rapidly but surely at around 1 or 2 eggs every 3 days. Subsequently the hatching of the eggs happens after 9 to 10 days.Afterwards the nymph molts begin to come out of the eggs and keep on gradually growing up until the 7th day of the cycle. During their 9th day, the bees grow 3 times their initial size. Following this, the young adult emerges. The final step occurs after 4 days when the bee reaches its maturity and females are ready to lay eggs again. Making the cycle begin again from the laying of the eggs.; The honeybee's life begins with the egg, which is laid by the queen in a cell of the honeycomb and lasts for three days. The larva looks like a small white worm, which eats royal jelly and pollen from the worker bees. This stage lasts for about six days and is the fastest growth stage of the bee. After the larva, the honeybee is in the pupa. In this stage, the larva is sealed in its cell and goes through metamorphosis. Pupation lasts for about twelve days. The pupa is inactive and in this stage the development of tissues is completed and the formation of wings, legs and other parts of the body. The pupa is still in the cell and the rest of its life is spent here, in this state, which lasts from a few weeks to a few months, depending on its role in the hive. This is a valuable example of the biological metamorphosis, which shows the complicated development and adaptation of the bees and how they are sustainable in the environment and in the life of the hive. Honey bees, which play a significant role in pollination and food crops, are an important species.
336;The diagram below shows the production of olive oil. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;This illust displays all the procedures by which olive oil is produced from olives. There is a total of seven steps where the initial step is to pick some olives, and the final step is to extract only olive oil from pressed olive paste.To put into detail, obtaining enough amounts of olive is the starting process. Picked olives are rinsed in cold water. After that, rinsed olives are delivered into a smashing machine through belts. This machine enables olives to divide into olive paste and olive stones. Thereafter, only olive paste is put into hollow bags and carried into the pressing process. Olive paste inside the bag is pressed and further move into separating process. A portion of olive oil is completely removed from the rest of water portion. Finally, extracted olive oil is delivered to storages and on the market if necessarily. This is the complete process of olive oil production.; The process begins with the collection of ripe olives, which can be done either by hand or mechanically. The quality of the olives plays a great part in the flavor and quality of the oil. Next, the olives are washed to remove all impurities and then they are crushed into a paste. This paste undergoes a special mixing process that enables the oil droplets to come together. Then, after the oil has been extracted, it is separated from the remaining water and solid particles by decantation. The paste, after mixing, is pressed. The pressing can be done by using a hydraulic press or by centrifugation, which is a more modern and effective method. During this process some producers use a cold extraction process, which preserves the flavor and the nutritional value of the oil. After the extraction, the oil is filtered to remove any remaining impurities, and it is ready for bottling. This process from the collection of the olives to the bottling shows how the quality of the oil can be influenced by the care and attention that is given to the making of it.
574;The diagram below shows the proposed town. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram describes the map of a proposed village, although its name remains unknown. Overall, it is evident that the town will be configured around a central square, which will be mostly used as a parking lot.Most buildings of the future town will be used as dwellings. Currently, there are 16 housing units that will be constructed both inside and outside the ring roads. Additionally, there are plans to build at least 5 recreational areas, so children and their families could spend time together while relaxing and playing. This will improve the citizens' quality of life.Not all the areas of the proposed village, however, will be residential buildings and parks. At least 2 entire blocks will be used as industry areas. These blocks will be allocated at the town's periphery, which will hopefully reduce the amount of noise that the future inhabitants will be exposed to. On the other hand, at least 2 parking lots and 2 bus stands will be built at the central square. All the roads will be directed towards the central square, which will facilitate car circulation and mobilization. Finally, a few ring roads will be constructed to facilitate the inhabitants' access to their homes.; The diagram shows a well-planned town that is focused on functionality, open space and social cohesion. The design has a combination of residential, commercial and recreation areas, which allows people to have a balanced life. The outskirts of the town are made up of low-rise apartment blocks and single-family houses. This arrangement gives the residents quick access to shopping and entertainment, but still offers the serenity of suburban life, which appeals to families and individuals. It is the centralization of the commercial area that attracts residents and visitors, and the harmonious social atmosphere encourages social contact. This arrangement highlights the importance of pedestrian accessibility, which is an increasingly important consideration in urban planning. The main design of the town is focused on interconnectivity. A network of roads and pedestrian ways radiates outwards from the centre, linking the residential areas with the commercial and other facilities. Parks and community gardens are dotted amongst the residential areas, offering essential play and relaxation areas for all ages. Pedestrianized and bicycle friendly routes enhance the sense of community and the promotion of a healthy lifestyle. In conclusion, the proposed town combines a good combination of living, working and recreation. The combination of residential and commercial, the strong network of paths and the generous green areas, together with a sense of community, fits in well with the new urban living trend. The design aims to create a harmonious and socially cohesive environment for the inhabitants.
606;The diagram below shows the structure of solar panels and its use.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagrams illustrate the construction of a simple solar panel and how it works to heat air or water while passing through the inner chamber of the equipment. Although more complex and modern solar panels are available in today’s world, a solar panel simply consists of three main parts, a box-shaped basement, transparent glass, the entry, the exit of the inner tube. Naturally, sunray as an energy source is essential to use the heating system.Considering the function of solar panel, transparent glass which is in optimal thickness act as a receiver of heat from the sun, that eventually transfer to air or water. A similar principle works for both substances. While the substance to be heated moves through the cylinder, heat energy is convected that provides heated material which can be used for different purposes such as household or commercial needs. Finally, a heated substance is pumped into pipes which are mounted to the outlet of the panel.; The diagram shows the structure of the solar panel and its use. The basic structure of the solar panel is the photovoltaic cell, usually made of silicon. The solar panel consists of several key components, such as photovoltaic cells, glass cover, insulating material, and aluminum frame, each of which plays an important role in the conversion and protection of solar energy. The photovoltaic cell is the main component of the solar panel. It is used to convert sunlight into electricity through the photovoltaic effect. The glass cover protects the cells from the external environment, and at the same time can transmit sunlight with a low reflection, thereby ensuring a high energy conversion efficiency. The insulating material, which is usually made of glass or durable plastic, is used as an insulating material and also acts as a support and framework to prolong the life of the panel. In terms of its performance, the components arranged in this way enable the solar panel to operate normally in various conditions. The aluminum frame, which is used to reinforce the structure of the panel, is also used for easy installation and installation. The structure of the solar panel is generally uniform, with a flat face, strategically inclined to absorb sunlight throughout the day, and high power generation. In summary, the solar panel is a carefully designed system that integrates many parts to optimize the conversion of solar energy. For example, the photovoltaic cells are used to convert energy, while the glass cover is used to protect the cells from the external environment. At the same time, the performance of the panel is improved by the use of a small inverter and an optimizer, which can produce more electricity even in partial shade. In this way, the effectiveness and convenience of using this kind of renewable energy can be improved. As a sustainable energy solution, it is not only effective but also durable.
760;The diagram gives information about the process of making carbonated drinks.Summarise the information by selecting and report in the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagrams show the process that occurs when making carbonated drinks. There are various steps in the process starting with Water cleaning to Package for supermarket.In the first part of process is Water cleaning, Raw water will be sent to factory to filter it including using water softener and chemical to clean all water before sending it to pump. The second part of process is Heating evaporation and carbonation, the pump will send to electric heaters which heating evaporation occurs through a cooling pipe. Then, carbonation by adding carbon dioxide. In this part water will be changed to carbonated water. The next stage is Mixing, the carbonated water will mix together in the mixing tank. In this part, the tank will add coloured including syrup and flavour as well. Then, filter the water again for Filtering and filling where live in stage 4. Water will fill into 2 parts which are Bottles and Cans. Finally, packaging to supermarket for selling worldwide.; I chose to write about the method of making soda water. The process consists of five main stages: water purification, carbonation, flavoring, bottling, and packaging. Carbonation is a crucial step that carbon dioxide is injected under high pressure into the water, causing the water to produce bubbles, and not only makes the drink feel good, but also adds to the refreshing taste of the drink. This process is usually done with a variety of different flavors such as fruit extracts, various flavors, and various flavors, which varies from the manufacturer and the kind of drink. After the carbonation is completed, the flavoring agent is added to the water to achieve the desired flavor. This is a critical step that ensures that the beverage will remain stable and effective throughout its shelf life. The next step is bottling, where the flavored and carbonated beverage is carefully placed in a glass or metal bottle, and sealed to prevent leakage and contamination. In short, the diagram effectively shows the complicated process of making carbonated drinks from water purification to packaging, and highlights the important stages from the beginning of purification to the end of packaging. By implementing a unified system, this step will ensure that the beverage reaches the end customer in good condition. The process of making soda water is a complex process, but it seems to be a simple drink.
422;The diagram gives information about the process of making carbonated drinks.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram illustrates how carbonated drinks are made from raw water using different equipments at different stages.Overall, there are 5 stages involved in the process from using water from houses to packaging the drinks using either bottles or cans for safe consumption. They water is basically transported using pipes.The first stage involves cleaning the raw water from residential homes using a filter and then adding a water softener and other chemicals to it. The water is then pumped for heating evaporation and carbonation where it is heated using electric heaters, cooled through a cooling pipe and then carbonated in a tank using carbon dioxide.This carbonated water is then transferred into the mixing tank where it is mixed and colouring,syrup and flavour is added to it at this point. The end product is finally filtered and filled into bottles or cans which is then packaged into boxes and transported for sale in the supermarket.; The process of making carbonated drinks begins with obtaining the water and purifying it to get a pure base for the drink. The diagram gives a comprehensive overview of the process from the first input to the final package of the drink. The water is then filtered, after which it is mixed with a syrup, usually containing sugar, fruit juice, or other flavourings, and this stage is very important as it determines the flavour of the final product. After the mixing of the water and syrup, the liquid is carbonated. It is carbonated by introducing carbon dioxide under pressure, and this gives the drink its characteristic bubbles and makes it palatable. This step also makes the liquid softer and more pleasant to drink. In conclusion, the process of making carbonated drinks is very systematic and involves several steps. After cooling, the liquid is bottled or canned, and this is a very important stage as it determines the quality and taste of the drink. The diagram gives an idea of the whole process from the beginning of the ingredients to the final product. The diagram also shows how careful treatment of the ingredients is required to produce a drink of a certain quality.
320;The diagram shows a process of making a storage area from a material called concrete canvasSummarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram illustrate processes of storage area is make from concrete canvas material.The first step is concrete canvas manufacturing, It is bulit by combine three layers , which is Fibrous top surface, dry concrete and waterproof layer in order, and it is delivered by transportation to the area, then unwrapping the canvas from package to the next stage spreading area on the ground by use pegs on four corner of the 10 metres area with the rope on back of a car. Next step is use airpumping by eject air in the area with airpump which have a door on the opposite to increase area size. then watering the area by spring the water until it have grow to 8 metres, and then let it set by air for 20 to 24 hours.After that, the final outcome can use for storage.; This process begins with the preparation of the area on which the store will be built. The preparation consists of removing any obstacles and laying a firm foundation on which the concrete canvas will be placed. This is a new material that offers several advantages, including its quick deployment and its adaptability to all environments, which makes it suitable for many applications. Once the concrete canvas has been laid, the next critical step is hydration. This step is critical because it starts the hydration of the concrete, which hardens and increases its strength and endurance. The canvas is saturated with water, which activates the concrete inside it. In addition, the use of an anchor or other strong material can help ensure the stability of the concrete canvas and prevent any movement that could affect the storage area. This strengthening is a final step that ensures the long-term stability of the concrete canvas and helps it resist external factors. In conclusion, a concrete canvas store is a useful and efficient way of building. The use of concrete canvas is a significant development in the use of materials in building and underlines the continuing evolution of materials. It is a quick, easy, and flexible way to build a weatherproof and durable area.
126;The diagram shows the components of a neuron and how it worksWrite a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram below identifies the role of each neuronal components and illustrates the message transmission process happening in a neuron.The main component of a neuron is the cell body or soma. From its core branches out many small nerves called dendrites with the role of receving messages from other cells. The acquired messages are passed away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles or glands through a chain of axon. Each axon is coverred by a small element called myelin sheath that helps speed up the neural impulses.The message transmission process is conducted by continous actions of each component. After the dendrites receive information, the cell body will trigger an electrical signal traveling down the axon chain carrying these messages to a destination consisting of a network off terminal buttons. Each button form junction with other dendrite other cells to connect the messages. After all, all neuron are connected to form a network.; The specialized cells of the nervous system, which transmit signals throughout the body, are responsible for many physiological processes. The core of the neuron is a soma, which is a cell body containing a nucleus and organelles. From the cell body grow two major structures - dendrites and axons. Dendrites, like tree branches, receive signals from other cells and can accumulate information. The nucleus contains the genetic material and regulates the most important functions of the cell. The axon is a long, thin projection from the cell body and transmits electrical impulses away from the cell body to communicate with other nerves, muscles and glands. One of the most important structures of the axon is the myelin sheath, a fatty tissue that insulates and facilitates faster transmission of nerve impulses. Axonal terminals are the points at which the axon terminates. Small openings in the myelin sheath called the nodes of Ranvier are essential for the generation and propagation of action potentials, the electrical signals that transmit information along the neuron. The knowledge of the structure and function of the neuron is important for understanding complex nervous networks and the role of the nervous system in health and disease. This is the basis of further research in neurobiology, neuropsychology and other related areas. At the synapse, between the neuron and the adjacent neuron, the chemical messenger neurotransmitter is released into the synaptic gap and binds to the appropriate receptors on the receiving neuron.
486;The diagram shows the design of a modern landfill for household waste. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;These illustration graphs explain the process of how a modern landfill for domestic waste is created.There are three sective of entire process, including construction, which could be divided into two steps, followed by the section of the use and the final part which is the closure.Start with the construction by createing an artificial deep hole, which surrounded by the natural rocks. Pilling up the hole with synthetic substance and clay ,respectively, before instal the drainage tank and grainage pipes. Four drainage pipes are settled parallelly and all connected with a main pipe reach out the hole.After the preparation is completed, it comse with the official use. Set the domestic trash inside the hole, which allows the waste liguid draning in the ground through the clay. The last part is closure, which the holw will be coved with clay, which the gases produced along the process will be outputted through the pipes connect to outer place.; The most remarkable feature of the design of the modern waste disposal is the multi-layered layout of the waste. The diagram shows the modern waste disposal with several components and features that allow for the proper disposal of waste and minimize its impact on the environment. The waste disposal is also equipped with a gas extraction system. The waste disposal has a very strong liner system made of clay and plastic that prevents the harmful liquid that is formed when the waste decomposes from entering the surrounding soil and groundwater. The leaked leaked into the reservoir and further into the tanks where it is subsequently treated. Another important feature is the closing system. The organic waste, as it decomposes, produces a lot of methane gas that is subsequently tapped and used to generate electricity, which is the most eco-friendly waste management approach. The modern waste disposal is a combination of several advanced techniques aimed at protecting the environment while managing household waste. The waste disposal is regularly covered with soil to prevent odors and cockroaches, which further contributes to maintaining the environment around the facility. In addition, the waste disposal system is designed to close and rehabilitate when it reaches its capacity, so that it can be subsequently used as a park or recreation area. Through such innovations, waste disposals have become much more sustainable and less damaging to the environment. The multi-layered structure, the system for regulating leaked leaked and gas extraction and the possibility of using the facility in the future are a significant advancement in waste disposal.
240;The diagram shows the different stages in the production of woolen goods.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram below depicts several steps in producing the woolen goods.Overall, we can divide the steps into two stages where the first one is you have to produce the wool and the second one is to make the string.In order to get the wool pr the string, we have to do the shearing process and clean them after we take them from the sheep. After that, we let them dry in a sufficient temperature outside so that we can spin them.After we finish the spinning process, we break them into two productions which are wool and string. The string production can be recycled while the wool can be made into tufts of wool and put them in the tuft of storage.The balls of yarn comes from the tuft storage which later are the things that we are knitting. The balls of yarn are also the main source to make woolen goods such carpets and jackets which are usually we use in a daily life.; In woollen goods the various processes can be divided into a number of separate steps: wool-shearing, cleaning, carding, spinning, weaving and finishing. The diagram of the different stages in the production of woollen goods gives a comprehensive picture of the stages from raw material to the finished article. This diagram is of considerable importance, since it determines the quality and quantity of the wool obtained. The next stage is cleaning, which is an essential process, since it is here that impurities are removed, dirt and grease. The next stage is spinning, where the carded wool is twisted and drawn into long strands, which form the foundation for weaving. After cleaning the wool is carded, that is, the wool is broken into small fibres and arranged in order for spinning. Then follows spinning, and then weaving, which consists of arranging the strands to form the fabric, the design and thickness of which depend on the finished woollen goods. The final stage is finishing, and includes processes such as dyeing and setting the weave, which increase the fabric’s strength and appearance. All in all, the diagram well illustrates the complexity of woollen goods, and the importance of each stage in producing the finished product. In fact, each stage is linked to the other, for example, the quality of the woollen material depends on the quality of the carded and woven wool. Advances in technology can help to increase the speed and quality of these processes.
734;The diagram shows the procedure for university entry for high school graduates.Write a report for a university or college lecturer describing the information.;The given diagram illustrates how high school students can get entry in the university.Overall, it is clear that it is a multi-phase procedure and starts from completing high school education and ends in university admission, by submitting complete admission form and all required documents.First of all, the aspirants should have completed high school education. Then, they need to download application from the website to fill it. After completion of the admission form, it has to be sent to the admin. Also, documentation which has already been compiled is sent to them. Furthermore, admin office also recieve complete application forms for alternative courses. It is the admin office, which decides the fate of applications, by taking three decisions. Some of the applications are granted provincial acceptance in two weeks and they are asked to submit additional documents. The other applications face direct rejection, in which the rejected applicants have given the choice to either apply for alternative course or cancel their applications. The remaining applications are granted enrolment in two week time.Those who are enrolled in the University choose their subjects. After that, they register with the Dean and finally ready to start studying at University.; This report will firstly examine the basic conditions for high school graduates wishing to enter university or college. This process can be divided into the following basic phases: preparing to apply, submitting documents, candidate selection, and admission. Preparedness begins with ensuring that the minimum academic requirements are met, including good grades in a range of required courses, and satisfactory performance on a standardized entrance exam, such as the ACT or SAT, which is required by some universities. Once these have been achieved, a high school graduate is able to move on to the application stage. To do this, the graduate must gather the documents required, including an official high school transcript, letters of recommendation, personal statements, and, in some cases, portfolios of past work. All documents must be submitted by the appropriate deadlines, which vary from one institution to another. After the documents have been reviewed, the university begins the process of evaluating candidates. Some candidates may also be asked to take part in an interview, during which they are asked to explain their motives for wishing to study at that particular institution. Once the evaluation process is complete, successful candidates receive an offer letter, and are expected to make a decision about their future enrollment. In conclusion, the diagram demonstrates that the process of university entry for high school graduates is clearly structured, with each step clearly defined, from preparation to enrollment. After a student has received an offer letter, and has decided to accept it, further actions are required, including paying the tuition deposit and registering for courses. This final stage culminates in the successful transition from high school to university life, and the start of a new academic journey. This well-defined structure allows high school graduates to easily navigate the complicated application process.
844;The diagram shows the production of circuit boards.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The flow chart sheds light on how circuit boards are produced.Overall, the chart presents a multi-phase process that starts with the delivery of raw materials and ends with final products being delivered to factories.When the raw materials are delivered to circuit-board producers, they will be cut and sprayed with fire retardant, and experience the cleaning process. Subsequently, the product will undergo the automatic IC attachment and soldering. Following the IC attachment and soldering, there will be two stages of quality oversight, including visual inspection and quality control testing and final testing. If each of the inspection stages identifies any substandard products, the chips from such rejected products will be discarded. On the contrary, the products that pass the inspection process will be packaged and then sent to relevant users.To draw a conclusion, the production of circuit boards consists of a few stages, such as cutting and spraying, IC attachment and soldering, quality supervision, etc.; The diagram shows the process of producing circuit boards, which involves many different stages. The first is the design stage, where the specifications and the layout are worked out by the engineers. The process can be divided into seven steps from the beginning of the designing stage to the final stage of mounting. The next stage is where the layer of copper is applied to the board. This is followed by the selection of the right material for the base, usually fibre glass, which gives strength and electrical insulation. The material is cut into the correct size to fit into the intended device. The copper layer is covered with a layer of photosensitive material, which is exposed to a special light, and the unused areas are washed away to leave only the parts of the board which have the desired pattern. Next the board is drilled, to provide the necessary holes for the connections between the various electronic parts. This is a very important stage, as the accuracy affects the final performance of the finished device. After the etching, the copper is cleaned away, and the board is made more precisely. Finally, the boards are inspected and tested to make sure they work properly, before they are packed up and sent to the manufacturer. Finally, the board is soldered with a soldering iron, and the various components such as resistors and capacitors are added. This stage is usually done by an automatic machine, to ensure accuracy and speed. The production of circuit boards is a series of careful operations requiring both technical skill and the right material, and each step is important for the final performance of the product.
794;The diagram shows the production of hydroelectricitySummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram displays the general principles of how electricity is generated in a dam. In general, to produce hydroenergy, there should be a difference in the level of water flowing through the turbine.The water is stored in the reservoir out of which it goes through the intake to the penstrock. The pens should be inclined. This means that its high point is in the intake and then it goes down to the turbine. The pressure, that the flow creates, makes the turbin roll and start the generator. Generator produces power that is supplied to the long distance power lines.Having passed throuth the turbine, water, in its turn, sharply goes down and falls into the river.As it can be seen from the diagram, the generator and long distance power lines are located on the ground while there parts of the dam, such as the intake, the penstock, and the turbine are all under the ground.; It is possible to use water in the production of electricity, in order to harness the flow of the water. The basic structure of the hydropower plant is the dam that creates a reservoir by preventing the flow of water and thus allowing the accumulation of water behind the dam. The diagram shows the main features of the various steps in the production of hydropower. When electricity is needed, the gate of the dam opens and the water flows into the reservoir through an intake. The diagram shows how the descending water is led through the penstock, a large pipe that directs the flow of water. The level of water in the reservoir is important because it determines the potential energy that is available to produce electricity. This water is flowing downhill and gaining kinetic energy, which is used when it reaches the turbine at the end of the penstock. The water turns the blades of the turbine, converting the mechanical energy of the movement into electrical energy by driving a generator. A feature of this process is that it is efficient and sustainable, compared with the production of electricity from fossil fuels, and that the production of electricity from water has a lower effect on the environment than the production of electricity from coal or oil. The generator and the electricity produced by it are fed into the electrical grid. In conclusion, the hydropower system effectively converts the kinetic energy of moving water into usable electricity, and it is a sustainable way of producing energy. But when a dam is constructed, the construction itself may cause disruption of the local environment, and the long-term effect of the reduced water level on the local environment and local communities needs to be taken into consideration. This diagram shows the relations between the various components, and it shows the importance of controlling the water flow in order to obtain maximum efficiency in the production of electricity from water.
768;The diagram shows the relationship between a numbers of different languages. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;This diagram illustrates the connection between different types of English language.Overall, English has two big branches - American English and British english, that divide further in to subbranches. Furthermore, British english has more subbranches tan American english.In terms of American English, it divides into two main subbranches - USA and Canada. Canada further divides into two types of language - Angelophone and Francophone Canadian. Whereas, USA branch divides in to six types of languages, such as Philipines, American Samoa, West coast, Mid west, North-east coast and Puertorico.British English has three times more subbranches than American english branch. One of the subbraches is West indies, that divides into Jamaican and Barbados. Similarly, Far east and Australian subbranches also divides into two subbranches (Malay and chinese, and Australian and Newzealand respectively). West african, Angelophones and East African are three languages that belong to the African Subbranch. Last two subbranches - Indian pakistan and British Isles each divide into four types of languages, British Isles into Irish, English, Welsh and Scotish, and Indian Pakistan into four different forms of indian english.; Essentially, it shows the division of languages into families, the most significant being the Indo-European family, which then divides into groups such as Germanic, Romance, and Slavic languages, and finally into individual languages such as English, French, and Russian. In this family the Romance languages, which derive from Latin and include French and Italian, are clearly differentiated from the Germanic group. Within the Germanic family the languages are further divided into the North, West, and East Germanic languages. The close relationship between English and German, for example, reveals their common roots. And the diagram shows the relationship between languages through their historical development, while demonstrating the great diversity of human languages. There are also other important families of language, for example the Afro-Asiatic and the Sino-Tibetian, and they demonstrate the diversity of human languages in different parts of the world. For example, Chinese, which belongs to the Sino-Tibetian family, is vastly different from Arabic, which belongs to the Afro-Asiatic group. The diagram reveals the complex interrelationships between these families, and the shared historical origins and unique development of human languages.
192;The diagrams below show how houses can be protected in areas which are prone to flooding.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The schemes compare two different methods of defence for homes that can be easily affected by floods. Overall, they show flood protection with and without a stopbank, while the at-risk home is raised higher above ground level in two pictures.The first diagram depicts how a stopbank acts as a natural barrier to prevent river water from flooding. The stopbank is a small mound of land next to the river that is higher than the 100-year-flood level and prevents the drain from overwhelming its banks. Nearby buildings can be built on stilts to prevent flooding from rainwater as well as the water passing through the floodgate beneath the stopbank, resulting in an area of ‘internal ponding.’If it had not been a stopbank, as described in the second diagram, there would have been nothing to stop the river from flooding. In this case, the solution is to put homes on stilts much higher than the one in the first picture. The height of the stilts is measured to ensure that the floor of the house is three hundred meters above the 100-year-flood level regardless of how deep the water area is under the house. This measure is called the ‘freeboard.’; This is a sketch of a conventional house that is on the ground floor and exposed directly to the water. This design offers limited protection as floodwaters can easily damage the foundations and the house itself. The second diagram, on the other hand, is a design for an elevated house that is built above the flood level. This design has columns, which allow water to flow under the building and reduce the damage to the foundations and lower living areas. The equipment and wiring that is installed on this floor are also vulnerable to damage by water, which can cause additional safety risks and costs in the event of flooding. Both diagrams offer different ways of dealing with the danger of flooding, but the solution that is the best option is to raise the house. Not only does this prevent damage to the building, but it also raises the essentials such as wiring and heating out of the water. The design also includes a sloped courtyard to direct water away from the house, which also increases flood resilience. This solution also allows people to recover after flooding as it reduces the cost of repairs and reduces the time to return to normal life. In conclusion, the diagrams show the stark difference between a conventional and elevated house in flood-prone areas. The first offers limited protection against flooding and is less resilient, while the second offers a more advanced approach to a safe and resilient structure. The second option can serve as a model for future developments in similar environments.
966;The diagrams below show the design for a wave-energy machine and its location.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;first of all, the picture show (A Wave- energy machine) we can see that there is electricity generator its the machine that take the energy from the waves and it contain two turbines so the air could flow throuh it and from what it shown we can notice that there is two of wave energy machin: the large waves and the small waves.Secondly,the small wavs had low output since its for the small waves, in addition it also had low installation costs because its smaller.in the other hand the large waves had high output and high installation costs since its also large.To sum up we can say that the air flow to the turbine so the turbine could move and got the electrisity , there is also air come from the water levels which hepls the machine get the elecricity that it needs so the people could use it like a solar power.; The wave-energy machine converts the kinetic energy of waves into electricity. The diagrams show the structure of the machine and its location. The machine consists of two chambers. The chambers are placed under the water surface and waves come into the lower chamber. The rising water level pushes air out of the upper chamber and a water pump drives a generator to generate electricity. The diagrams also show the effects of the environment on the design. The site is strategically placed along the coast where prevailing waves run. The machine is firmly fixed to the seabed and can be used for a long time. The waves are changed into electricity by the carefully designed machine that combines the effects of its structure and its location. The machine is placed in a place where the waves are stable and does not interfere with the balance of the environment. The balance between energy production and conservation is very important, because the balance of marine life is necessary for the diversity of life. The balance between energy efficiency and conservation is a great advantage, and this technology is a promising way to develop coastal areas.
916;The diagrams below show the development of the horse over a period of 40 million years.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant;The diagram depicts the different stages of the body habitus and the relative changes in foot structures that under went in the process of evolution of the modern horse, since 40 million years ago.The modern horse had gone through 3 main stages in order to become it's current version, each stage shows distinctive changes in the body as a whole.Having said that, the earliest species that existed is namely Echippus, then it was mesohippus and finally it was Merychippus.The Echippus is the identified first ancestor of the modern horse that existed 40 million years ago. They appeared relatively similar to the size of a sheep and their foot apearently had four toes.However, Mesohippus was the second in line of the modern horses and was relatively bigger and taller, the foot structure got limited to three toes and the middle toe being the widerest.15 million years after the existance of mesohippus, merychippus emerged, they were similar in both the size and shape of our modern horses, but as far as the foot is concerned the middle toe became more prominent and the rest two toes started to shrink. Finally, the modern horses look twice the size of Echippus and their feet looked proper coronet.; The earliest horse, Eohippus, was about 40 million years old. Its most developed form was mesohippus, which developed into the modern horse, Equus. When the climate changed and the meadows began to appear about 20 million years ago, Mesohippus appeared. This small, dog-sized animal had a large head, an arched back and four toes on each foot, showing that it lived mainly in woods where agility was necessary for moving through the thickets. Its teeth were adapted to a diet of soft grass and leaves, reflecting the fact that it was herbivorous and lived in a green environment. The molars were also more complex, indicating that its diet was changing to a more resistant grass, and the animal adapted to a more open landscape. This intermediate form was larger than the eohippus, its legs were longer and its body was longer, making it faster. Mesohippus not only benefited from its ability to move fast and economically on the plains, but also thrived in a grassland environment. The horse developed further, about 2 million years ago, into the modern horse. This is illustrated by the shift from a small, many-toed animal to a large, single-toed grazer, which shows the significant biological and physiological changes that took place, and demonstrates the flexibility and adaptability of the horse through its history. In conclusion, the horse shows a remarkable adaptation to changing environments over millions of years.
528;The diagrams below show the existing ground floor plan of a house and a proposed plan for some building work.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The information below shows the present floor plan and changes been suggested. Generally spekaing, there is no big difference, kitchen will stay as a kitchen and living room will stay as a living room.At the moment the living room space is smaller than in proposed new plan. The living room space suggested to be increased as internal wall will be demolited. Moreover, in suggested plan there is no place for storage under the stairs as stairs will be changed in their shape and also there will be no more hall place will be integrated into living room.The door intro kitchen will be switched from single one to double and will be located near the entrance door. The kitchen furniture suggested to be located on the opposite side to the wall and doubled indoor door. However, some things stays the same in both plans. For example, the location of both entrance doors - front and backyard and also wall between hall and kitchen.; The ground floor of the existing plan consists of a living room, a dining room, a kitchen and a small passage leading to the staircase. The proposed plan consists of the same rooms but with some changes intended to optimize space and increase functionality. This layout, although eminently practical, is slightly compartmentalized and there is no obvious relationship between the rooms. The living room occupies the whole of the front part of the house. The dining room, situated just behind the living room, leads into the kitchen. This change illustrates a trend towards open-plan living and a greater sense of openness between the different areas of the house. In the proposed plan the living room has been extended into the dining room, thereby increasing the available space and the inviting character of the room. Next, a new utility room has been added next to the kitchen, which increases the functionality of the kitchen by providing a separate area for washing up and storage. The dining room, in its new position at the back of the house, will enjoy more natural light and have a better view of the garden, thus improving the dining experience. The proposed changes thus illustrate a modern preference for open space and practicality in the home. In summary, the proposed alterations will convert the ground floor of the house from a compartmentalized layout into an open, spacious arrangement that will allow for better interaction between the rooms. The utility room will make for a more efficient and pleasant living experience.
784;The diagrams below show the water supply system in Australia present and in future.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The given diagram illustrates the processes involved in the water supply system in Australia at the present and in the future.To begin, the first kind of water is located in the dam and storage where the waste water is lead to a water treatment plant. Meanwhile, from the storage come out pure water and provide potable water to households, factories, shops, and all the city. At the same time, the wastewater produced in the city is transferred to a water treatment plant as well.The last type of water is the storm water that is sent to the river from the city.Overall, it can be seen that the process has three types of waters in the process of water supply which are pure, storm, and waste water. depending on the type of water, these can be found in the dam and storage, water treatment plant, river and in different places of the city such as households, factories, shops, among others.; Presently, Australia's water supply is provided by a combination of rivers, dams, and reservoirs supplemented by industrial and domestic water treatment facilities. This system suffers considerable strain because of the variability of rainfall, which causes droughts and surpluses. The proposed future water supply system is an evolution of the present system. Presently water is drawn from natural sources, treated, and then distributed to towns and cities, resulting in the evaporation of water from open reservoirs and the high cost of transporting water over long distances. Leakage from old pipes further increases the problem of water management. Presently, water supply relies on large open reservoirs. In contrast, the proposed future water supply system involves the implementation of advanced water treatment and recovery methods, such as rainwater harvesting, and desalination plants which are powered by renewable energy sources. In addition, the future system integrates smart technology, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) for the monitoring of water usage and quality. This is to ensure that there is less water waste and greater water efficiency. In conclusion, the proposed future water supply system reflects an increasing awareness of the environment and the need for sustainable resource management. With the increasing demand for water and with a growing population, the aim is not only to secure water supplies for future generations but also to ensure that the water supply system is resilient to future changes in technology.
136;The diagrams show the structure of solar panel and its use.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram illustrates how a solar panel is constructed, and the complex process of how the renewable energy source provides heated water and air to households.The first diagram shows us visual information about the basic structure of the solar panel. It´s construction is mainly a large box with two pipes placed on both sides. Then, one equally large top which is transparent is placed on top of the container.According to the second diagram, the solar panel is designed to provide the home with warm air. Firstly, cold air is allowed in through the inlet and let inside the box. Secondly, the transparent top allows sunrays to transform the cool air to warm air by their heating properties. After that, the warm air goes through and out the outlet.In regards to the third diagram, we can clearly see that the construction is similar with the exception that water pipes are added in the main box, in order to supply households with hot water. In comparison with the second diagram, where air was driven through the pipes, water is the main resource here. After the water has entered the inlet, water passes through the pipes and out; In the heart of a solar panel, there are photovoltaic cells, which are usually made of silicon. A solar panel is fundamentally made up of several important parts, which work together to produce solar energy. The diagrams show the structure of a solar panel and how it works, explaining how the sunlight is converted into electrical energy. Below the cells, there is a waterproof backing layer, which provides structure, and prevents the cells from getting wet, ensuring their long life. These cells convert sunlight directly into electricity by the photovoltaic effect. In addition, additional components, such as box and mounting brackets, provide greater functionality and improve installation. Then the converted electrical energy is carried by the electrical circuits to the inverter, a key component in the system, which converts direct current into alternating current, which is used in households and industry. A solar panel’s practical use is not limited to electricity production. The box ensures the electrical connections are made properly, ensuring safe and efficient operation. The mounting brackets ensure that the panel is installed on a roof or on a frame, where it can receive the maximum amount of sunlight. It can be used to power private houses, commercial buildings and even large-scale grids. Their installation not only ensures greater energy independence, but also ensures a more sustainable environment. They significantly reduce the carbon footprint, which makes it possible to meet the needs of our energy supplies in a sustainable way. It is a great step forward in the development of solar energy, and the diagrams clearly show its structure and the way it works.
1360;The education system is the only critical factor in the development of a country, agree/disagree (from Target Band ;This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskSome people say that the education system is the only critical factor in the development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Write at least 250 wordsEducation plays an imperative role in the overall progression of a country. Many people may heavily rely on quality education as preparation for real life employment and experiences. However, there are other factors that are needed to propel a country towards success.We must acknowledge the way the education system of a country prepares most individuals by equipping them with various skills. Prior to gaining a qualification to practice certain professions such as teaching, nursing or accounting, it is necessary for the individuals to undergo rigorous training. Certificate and diploma programs as well as university degrees are good examples of that. Some graduates may even choose to pursue further studies to attain certain requirements to be able to practice their chosen profession.The education system is undoubtedly important in preparing individuals to take on roles leading to the development of a country. However, it seems that producing graduates alone isn’t a guarantee of the advancement of a country. There are other factors that should come into play, and motivation of individuals is one. Without motivation, people may lose track of what they intend to do to contribute to the improvement of a country. drives people to achieve and maximize their potentials, because they are determined to get better at many aspects of their life, eventually yielding improvement for their entire country.Furthermore, the availability of natural resources and job opportunities may also affect the growth of a national economy. Innovations of many individuals require raw materials, and should the country be able to mine these, their production and perhaps even export may help in stabilizing the local market. Finally, it is also important that the availability of employment is aligned with the skills of individuals applying for the positions. Giving skilled people the opportunity to apply their knowledge and experience in their profession makes them more productive, which contributes to GDP growth.In conclusion, education continues to play a pivotal role in the development of a country. However, other important factors should play a role in order to achieve steady and continuous progress.This response adequately addresses the task prompt. The writer’s viewpoint is clear throughout the essay. Each paragraph has its role and they are used effectively to organise ideas and information. The coherence and advanced vocabulary help the writer to create an impression of a skilled, fluent English user. Good control of grammar and punctuation is evident. This essay could achieve Band 8 in IELTS.; the following task) . A strong education system is essential for the development of a skilled workforce. Education plays an important role in promoting economic growth, social cohesion and innovation. And more than that, education teaches people critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which they can then apply to address complex societal issues. The countries where people have higher levels of education generally have higher economic productivity. This is mainly because the economic policies, transport and communication systems, political stability, and natural resources of the country also play a key role in the development of a country. However, it is not possible to single out education as the only critical factor in a country's development. Culture and social equality also play an important role in the development of a country. It is not surprising that the development of a country such as Singapore is related to the presence of a strong government and a strong education system. The role of education in the development of a country can be reduced to a single factor. This is because, for example, a society that values equality will realize the benefits of a good education system. The interaction between these factors is what shapes the development of a country. The most complete development requires a multi-pronged approach involving the economic, political and social dimensions.
1291;The end of the world’s fossil fuel resources and the subsequent changes will be a positive development in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Today’s society overwhelmingly depends on products made from fossil fuels. Most people would initially think about fuel for transport, but of course, fossil fuels are part of most of the fabric of life around us, from the plastics on our furniture to the pavements that we walk on. Changing our reliance on these resources can have various consequences; however, I believe that overall the society will benefit from finding viable alternatives for them.Depending on whether eco-friendly alternatives are developed, the positive effect on transport and the reduction of the associated pollution will be significant. Exhaust fumes from motor vehicles, planes and ships decrease air quality and contribute to global warming and the greenhouse effect. People’s health and the health of the planet will surely improve without these industries relying on fossil fuels. It could be that a type of transport crisis could develop as a result if society can no longer provide the power to transport so many individuals to where they want to go. This, however, does not have to be a bad thing, as it could force society to use alternative solutions, such as transport sharing and public transport development. The change in mind set has already begun. Some countries have already committed to having fossil fuel free transport and more cities are banning private vehicles from the centre of cities.Another positive development would be that more time and money would have to be put into developing renewable sources of energy, such as wind power, solar power, hydropower and tidal power. Technologies would improve and be more efficient and again, the world would use fewer sources of energy that cause pollution. This development can also be seen today, with many governments committing to proportions of their power needs coming from renewable resources.I, therefore, strongly agree with the statement that the changes from reducing reliance on fossil fuels will be positive. The only caveat is that society will need to have developed alternative sources of power rather soon, in order to avoid an energy crisis."; First of all, the end of fossil fuels can stimulate the development of new energy technology. On the one hand, it could be a positive step towards a sustainable society, while on the other hand, this transition could be a serious challenge. These changes could reduce the world's carbon dioxide emissions and lead to more energy independence for the countries that use them. In countries such as Denmark, for example, wind energy is being used so much that it already accounts for a large share of their electricity consumption. The decrease in the supply of fossil fuels can also cause an increase in the awareness of climate change and the need for a more sustainable way of life. In cities, for example, public transport, pedestrianization and horticulture will play an increasingly important role. Many people work in the fossil fuel industry all over the world and a rapid transition away from these resources could lead to high unemployment and economic unrest. Fortunately, however, this transition is not always without its negative consequences, because, for example, New York City's bike lanes and urban gardens show how cities can change for the better. Balance these different aspects of society and you will find out how far the inevitable changes benefit society. Finally, the transition to the use of renewable energy is not yet fully developed, which could result in energy shortages and energy imbalances during the transition period.
1307;The fact that enormous sums are paid for pieces of art is not acceptable at a time when many people around the world live in poverty. Discuss this statement and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is true that pieces of art in today’s world can change hands for enormous sums. Works by artists such as Picasso, da Vinci and Rembrandt have been sold for millions of dollars. Recently, a Modigliani was sold to a billionaire for one hundred and seventy million dollars. It certainly seems obscene that such figures are spent when many people around the world live in poverty.The work of many charities would be transformed by the money generated by just one of these art sales and in turn, the lives of ordinary people in need would be transformed. Medicines, food and shelter amongst other things could easily be provided, saving lots of lives, many of which would be children. When the issue is looked at from this point of view, the art sales world certainly seems obscene.However, in my opinion, things are unlikely to change. Human greed is endemic and people who have the drive to earn that amount of money and who actually have access to these sums in cash are not often people who will part with their wealth. Lots of prosperous people support many charities, but it is unlikely that they would completely relinquish their access to the luxuries that accompany their lives. The works of art are also often seen as investments in themselves, to be held on to for a period of time and then resold at a profit.In conclusion, in an ideal world, the vast sums of money that are spent on fine and rare works of art would be better spent on helping those in need. In reality, however, this is unlikely to take place.; Art is the essence of culture, history and human experience. However, art can be auctioned for millions, while many people say that these resources would be much better used to alleviate suffering and help the poor. The question of whether to spend so much money on art against the background of world poverty is an ethical one. Is it right to spend money on art? On the one hand, those who support the high art market argue that art plays an important role in society and enriches it culturally. For example, art lovers annually attract millions of tourists to Paris and Florence, which in turn contributes to the economy of these cities. But many people consider such spending a contradiction and a denial of human dignity. On the other hand, the contrasting relationship between the millions spent on art and the suffering of millions of people who live in poverty is too obvious. In addition, art is a tool for exposing social injustices and poverty itself. The resources used in the art market could be used to provide education, health care and food security for those in need. According to the World Bank, nine percent of the world's population lives on less than two dollars a day. Using these data, one must ask what is the most important thing in the world and what society considers valuable. With an equitable distribution of resources and more philanthropic spending in the field of art, it is possible to achieve a more just and caring society. In conclusion, while the high value of art shows its significance for society and culture, a balance must be found between art appreciation and the urgent need to eradicate poverty.
1042;The first chart below gives information about the money spent by British parents on their children’s sports between 2008 and 2014. The second chart shows the number of children who participated in three sports in Britain over the same time period.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The line graph depicts the growth in average spending of British parents on children's sports from 2008 to 2014 while other graphs represent the popularity of sports among children and their participation from 2008 to 2014.Overall, the first graph was about the average monthly spend on children's sports which was at an exponential rate while in the second graph football was the most popular among children.To begin with the first graph, the average monthly spending of parents on children's sports was increasing at an enormous rate from 20 pounds in 2004 to approximately 33 pounds in 2014.Meanwhile, the second graph was about participation in three different sports where football was the most popular sport among children approximately 7.9 million in 2008 to roughly 8 million. swimming was growing at a certain rate while athletics was not so popular until 2010 after that there was a rush in participation in contrast to swimming but after the peak in 2012, there was a decrease in participation.; The first chart shows that the total amount spent by parents on their children’s sports has significantly increased during the given period. In 2008, they spent about 150 million, but by 2014, this figure had risen to 220 million. The second chart shows that the total number of children who took part in the three sports was 812,084 for swimming, 862,962 for football and 917,259 for tennis. From this, it can be seen that football was the most popular during this period. The number of children participating in this sport began at around 700,000 in 2008, but, despite some fluctuations, reached a peak of around 950,000 in 2014. These numbers may indicate an increasing awareness of the importance of sports for the health and well-being of children. Parents are investing more money in the sport, but in the same period, the numbers of children taking part have varied, particularly in football, which has been a major sport in the UK for a long time. The figures for swimming, on the other hand, were fairly stable, beginning at around 400,000 children and gradually increasing to around 500,000 by the end of the period. Tennis, on the other hand, showed a significant decrease, beginning at around 200,000 and falling to about 150,000 in 2014. In conclusion, the information shows a clear trend in the increasing amount of money spent on sports by British parents and the rising number of children who play football, but the sport of tennis is in decline. While football is more popular, judging by the numbers, its popularity has remained stable, while tennis is waning.
52;The first chart below shows the percentages of women and men in a country involved in some kinds of home tasks (cooking, cleaning, pet caring and repairing the house. The second chart shows the amount of time each gender spent on each task per day.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The two given charts illustrates the houshold work done by male and female of a nation. where firstly, the amount of work done by men and women is measured in percentage, and secondly, the average time devoted to do perform those work is calculated in minutes.Overall, it can be clearly seen that women performed more tasks in both the given terms then men, Although, men performed House repairs more than women.Firstly, women performed more household work than men, their main interest was in cooking and cleaning, where 80% of women performed Cooking and 60 percent cleaning, where men were 20% less in both the tasks. However, Tasks like pet care and house repairs male were higher in percentage then female.Secondly, Ladies performed the mentioned tasks more than men in regards of cooking they spent about 1 hour and 20 min and in cleaning approximately 68 minutes. However, they were equal in pet care, Although men spend close to 20 min minutes in house repair on average basis.; Women are more involved in all four categories - cooking, cleaning, pet care and repairing the house. For cooking, women spend more time than men, almost 80% to 40%. For cleaning, the percentage of women is 75%, and the percentage of men is 30%. Pet care is a similar pattern, with women at about 50% and men at about 20%. However, the biggest difference is that only about 25% of women and 60% of men participate in repairs. Women cook for about an hour and a half every day, while men only spend about thirty minutes. The two-hour daily cleaning and cooking time is similar. In terms of pet care, women spend about an hour, while men spend only twenty minutes. However, the most prominent feature of the first table is that women are more involved in most housework, and they spend more time than men. However, the men are far more involved in house repairs, spending an hour and a half a day, while women spend only half an hour. These differences show that there is still a clear division of domestic labor between the sexes. However, men are more prone to participate in repairs, which is consistent with the existing gender role.
1188;The first chart below shows the results of a survey which sampled a cross-section of 100,000 people asking if they traveled abroad and why they traveled for the period 1994-98.The second chart shows their destinations over the same period.;The first chart indicates the results of a survey of people in the UK who traveled abroad and the reasons why they traveled from 1994 and 1998. In addition, there is another chart which areas they visited. Overall, it can be seen the main reason the UK residents visited abroad is for holiday, and the total number of people who traveled steadily increased every year, except for 1995. In addition, they visited Western Europe extraordinarily much higher than north America, and other areas.Initially, the total number of abroad visiter started at 22,072 in 1994. Somehow the total number decreased in 1995. It was specificalltry 21,610, but the number soared to 24,949 and reached a peak of 28,828 in 1996 and 1998 respectively. To break down the detail, the main purpose is for holidays. It is apparently much higher than other reasons and its percentage tend to be almost two-thirds every year. Aside from holidays, two reasons follow the second reason for business, the third reason for visits to friends and relatives. It is not so significant changes in percentage.Interestingly, , they almost visited western Europe from 1994 to 1998. The proportion of visitors is much higher than in north America and other areas.It seems to be around 90 percent of visitors went to western Europe.The proportion of visiter can be seen slightly increased, however, there is no significant change.; A variety of motives for traveling abroad are shown in the first chart. The most common motive for traveling abroad during this period was for recreation, with a large majority of respondents citing vacation as their reason for traveling abroad. Business was also a significant motive, illustrating the growing internationalization of industry. The second largest motive was visiting relatives and friends, indicating the enduring importance of personal relationships in motivating travel. The increasing leisure time and disposable income available to people during the mid-nineties may be seen as the result of a recovering economy. There was also an increasing interest in North America and Asia, a reflection of the increasing importance of these regions in the late nineties. The second chart shows the destinations of these travelers. The chart shows that Europe remained the most popular destination, particularly for leisure travelers, presumably because of the rich cultural heritage, historical sites and cultural experiences to be found there. The growing interest in Asia and North America reflects the growing importance of these regions and the increasing interdependence of people throughout the world. Together, these two charts give an interesting insight into the shifting motives for and destinations of international travelers, providing a foundation for understanding later developments in world tourism.
660;The flow chart below shows an automatic photo booth. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The automatic photo booth allows you to take photos of yourself by self-service. Insert sufficient amount of coins and choose colour or black & white at the panel. You are allowed to select 1 large format or 4 password-sized photos, but remember that if you use the photos in your passport, it has to be a colour one.In the photo-taking area, there is a circle-shaped chair with an adjustable stool. Adjust the height of the chair, so that it reaches the right eye level of the camera. Before taking the photo, you can refer to the mirror above the camera to have your hair and face ready for photo taking.The curtain should properly closed before you take the photos. Be seated if you are ready for the shot. Sit straight and wait for light signal flash after 3 seconds. After the shot, the photo will be delivered and available on the slot near the coin panel within 60 seconds.; In the flow chart, the first step is to select the type of photograph, which may be either a traditional portrait or a funny picture. This selection is the beginning of the whole experience and emphasizes individuality. After payment, the customer will be directed to the location where the photo will be taken. After the selection is made, payment is required. The diagram shows that the customer can pay with different payment methods, such as cash and credit cards, which offers the customer convenience and flexibility. Following the picture, the image will be processed and manipulated to give the best result. This step also includes the possibility of adjusting the background and the light to ensure the best possible result. The diagram is designed to be easy to use for people of all ages. It also offers flexibility and individuality because the customer can influence the photo process at several points. Afterwards the customer can print the photo or save it digitally, which makes it possible to satisfy various preferences. The photo booth is a modern solution that combines simplicity with personalization. The booth is also efficient, as shown by the smooth transitions from selection to payment, from picture to print, which shows a good combination of technology and everyday life.
714;The flow chart illustrates the consequence of deforestation. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features.You should write at least 150 words.;"The supplied illustration outlines the problems of cutting forests. As we can see, there are 4 main branches and each of them describes a certain issue, caused by deforestation.According to the first branch from the left, forest destruction can lead to the state when soil becomes hard and ""baked"". It occurs due to the fact that heavy logging equipment compresses the soil, as the first block of the chart says. Because soil becomes ""baked"", rain water starts to run off which causes flooding.If we look at the remaining branches, we can see that they all lead to the same conclusion - less biodiversity. But there are three different reasons for it. The first one is soil erosion. When we cut the trees, we have fewer tree roots to support the topsoil that eventually erodes.The second reason - increased risk of burning. It is followed by the destruction of waste wood. Then we have some micro-organisms such as pioneer species that move in and initiate degradation of vegetation. And it's all resulted in less biodiversity.The last branch starts with the fact that after cutting forests we have less plants to give back moisture to air, so less moisture enters the air. This triggers less precipitation, and so, increased droughts. Plants that unable to withstand hot and dry weather die and it ends with less biodiversity.To conclude everything, the main purpose of the presented flow chart was to demonstrate the severe damage that could be caused by deforestation."; The initial consequence of deforestation is the disappearance of habitat for many species of animals and disrupts the functioning of the whole forest ecosystem. From this initial consequence a whole series of consequences follows. This directly affects the food web, and as more and more species become extinct, the functioning of the whole system is disturbed even more. The most significant result of this is the decrease in the diversity of species. Deforestation also affects the course of climate change, as trees are an important source of carbon dioxide and the removal of trees contributes to the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. As a result, the global warming accelerates, and the weather becomes more extreme. The next consequence of deforestation is the deterioration of the soil, which also contributes to the increase in soil erosion, and, as a result of the loss of arable land, the number of cultivated fields decreases and the yield of agriculture decreases. In conclusion, the flowchart briefly demonstrates the multifaceted consequences of deforestation, and shows how it disrupts the functioning of the whole forest system, reduces the diversity of species, accelerates climate change, depletes the quality of the soil, and finally affects human societies. The flowchart also shows that deforestation affects human populations, especially those that depend on forests for their livelihoods, and, as resources decline, people are faced with unemployment, relocation, and the loss of cultural identity. A rapid and sustainable solution to deforestation is therefore a necessary part of a balanced, sustainable development of human societies.
78;The graph and chart below give information on the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures in degrees Celsius (°C) and the average number of days with rainfall each month for two Australian cities.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The line graph and chart below show data on the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures in degrees Celsius and the average number of days with rainfall each month, from January to December, for Brisbane and Canberra in Australia.Overall, both cities have similar tendencies throughout the entire period. Likewise, Canberra has lower temperatures than Brisbane during the whole year. In addition, Brisbane has a higher average number of days with rainfall than Canberra during most of the year.To start with, Canberra's maximum average daily temperatures have a significant decrease in tendency, from 27 degrees in January to only 11 degrees in July. In contrast, Brisbane's daily maximum temperatures present lower fluctuations from 28 degrees in January to just 21 degrees in July. Additionally, Brisbane reaches its highest maximum average daily temperature in February at 30 degrees, whilst Canberra reaches its lowest minimum average daily temperature in June and July at 2 degrees. Furthermore, the average number of days with rainfall decreases moderately during the winter season in Brisbane, from 14 days in February to 7 days in June, July and August. However, this is the opposite tendency in the average number of days with rainfall in Canberra which slightly increases from 7 days in February to 10 days in June, July and August.To sum up, Canberra has rainy and cold winters, whilst Brisbane has rainy and warm summers.; The table shows that Sydney is hotter than Melbourne all year round. The average daily maximum temperature in January is around 26°C, and the average daily minimum temperature is around 20°C. The minimum temperatures in Melbourne are much lower, between 6°C in July and 15°C in February. The table shows that the rainfall pattern for both cities is very different. Data on average temperatures for Sydney show a relatively mild climate with less variation, so it would be more attractive to those who prefer stable warm weather. On average, there are about 9 to 11 rainy days a month in Sydney, and slightly more rain in March and June. The average number of rainy days in Melbourne is 6 days a month, and about the same as in Sydney. The information about the climate of both cities is useful to residents, visitors and urban planners in making important decisions about the development of their city and the weather and their effect on life. It is especially useful for tourism, agriculture and urban planning in Australia.
920;The graph and pie chart below give information on in-house training courses in a large financial company.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The charts illustrated are a representation of some information regarding in-house training courses in a reputable financial company.In the grand scheme of things, more time was spent on technical aspects of the courses than on the other aspects within the year. Quite conversely people spent less time learning about health and safety. Most of the managers and secretaries thought the courses were important for the job but a handful thought it was a waste of valuable time.55 hours in the year were devoted to training courses. Of these, exactly 30 hours were spent on technical skills, 15 on Career Development, 10 on Inter personal skills and 5 hours on Health and safety.The opinion of Managers and Secretaries was also sought as shown in the next chart. Here we see that majority of both managers and secretaries believe the courses are important for the job; about 84% of Secretaries and just around 76% of managers. It makes sense then that only few of these groups of people think the courses are a waste of time (almost 10% for secretaries and just above 10% for managers).Exactly 50% of managers believe the courses are good for net working while a smaller percentage of secretaries, about 43%, are of the same opinion. A good number still believe the courses provide a good excuse for a change - about 66% for Managers and just shy of 65% for Secretaries."; Taking the graph, it can be seen that participation in training courses has risen markedly over the past five years, and in 2018 only 150 employees participated in courses. The pie chart gives us an idea of the kind of training focus. For example, the number of employees participating in financial courses and data analysis has remained fairly constant, while the number of employees attending soft skills courses has increased slightly and steadily, which may indicate a growing interest in people-related skills as well as technical skills. By 2023, this figure has risen significantly to about 450 employees, which indicates a growing emphasis on professional development. The pie chart shows the emphasis of the training course on the training course, showing that financial analysis represents the biggest slice, with 40 percent, and data analysis has the second largest, with 30 percent, which shows the priority of acquiring analytical skills needed in the financial industry. The remaining 20 percent is made up of soft skills and 10 percent for compliance. This data supports the idea that although technical skills are given priority, there is also a growing awareness of the need to acquire soft skills, although at a slower rate. In conclusion, the analysis of the graph and the pie chart indicates a significant commitment to in-house training in the company. And the rising number of participants and the focus on acquiring technical and soft skills clearly shows that the company is strategically focusing on developing its employees in these areas.
922;The graph below compares figures for the production and consumption of energy in the US from 1950 to 2000. It also predicts figures for 2025.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The line chart gives the comparision figure about how energy produced and consumed by the U.S.A. in a 50 year period starting in 1950 along with a 25 year projection. There is two lines, one representing the American energy's consumption and the other about the energy production in the U.S.A between 1950 and 2000 and the forecast figure from 2001 to 2025. Those were measured by British thermal Units.By and large, the consumption and production of energy in the U.S.A. grew strongly over the period from 35 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to approximately 90 quadrillion Btu in 2000 and from 25 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to 65 quadrillion Btu in 2000 respectively. There are a prediction in energry consumption reaching 135 quadrillion Btu in 2025 and 75 quadrillion Btu in energy production.The first detail to note is that the consumption and production of engery rose steadily over the period. They were significant fluctuation at the start of the period but had risen to around 50 quadrillion Btu in 1975. This was followed by the another fluctuation between 1975 and 2000 and recovered by nearly 90 quadrillion Btu in energy consumption in 2000 and 65 quadrillion Btu in energy production.The amount of energy consumption in the United States is projected to remain much higher and will be increased as much as energy production overall. Amercian willl spend 75 quadrillion Btu in energy consumption more than in energy production in the prediction of 2025.; From 1950 to 1970, both energy production and consumption showed a steady increase, reflecting the rapid industrialization and economic development in the post-war period. In 1970, energy production reached around 75 quadrillion BTU, and energy consumption peaked at around 80 quadrillion BTU. By the end of the 1970s, both production and consumption fell, with considerable fluctuations. In the early 1980s, energy consumption began to increase again, driven by an increased dependence on oil and gas. This gap shows a growing gap between the country's energy needs and domestic production capacity. Moving into the 1990s, the gap between energy production and consumption became more obvious, and in 2000, energy consumption reached around 100 quadrillion BTU, while energy production only reached 75 quadrillion BTU. Interestingly, energy production began to show a slightly different trend from consumption, and increased at a slower rate due to changes in resource availability and regulatory restrictions. The prediction for 2025 predicts a continued increase in energy consumption, and consumption will reach 120 quadrillion BTU, while production will rise slightly to 85 quadrillion BTU. It shows that unless new energy policies and technology are implemented, the United States will face increasing challenges in the sustainable use of energy, its dependence on foreign resources and the possibility of future energy security problems. In summary, the trend from 1950 to 2000 shows an increasing gap between the production and consumption of energy in the United States. The 2025 forecast predicts that energy production will increase even more.
722;The graph below presents the employment patterns in the USA between 1930 and 2010.Summarise the information by selecting and report in the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The line graph below illustrates the labor force patterns in the USA from 1930 to 2010. According to the graph, farming, fishing and foresting had singled out all the other types of labors and appeared to be the major source of employment in from 1930 to 1960, which had an emplyment rate up to almost 80, but as the US society became modernized, the employment rate in the those traditional types of work had dropped dramatically since 1970, and reached almost the lowest point of zero in 2010, whereas the other three types of labor-industrial, Sales and Office and Technical shared an average growth from 1970 to 2010.The modernization of US society and the developments of urban areas had changed the labor market, as labors in the technical, industrial and service fields were in high demands. In 1930, the employment rates of these industries remained under 20, but they started to increase in 1970. Industrial labor had the most rapid growth, which rose to almost 40 in 2010. It was followed by technical work, which also reached an approximate point of 30 in 2010. Salse and Office came into the third place, which slightly increased to 20 in the end of 2000s. Nevertheless, the of ""other services"" was the category in exception, as it remained unchanged since 1970 and maintained the average point of 10."; In the early thirties, agriculture was the leading industry, employing about thirty percent of the workforce. The figure shows a long-term trend of employment in agriculture, manufacturing and services. The gradual decline in the agricultural sector was accompanied by technological progress, which led to a decrease in the need for labor. This corresponds to the general agrarian economy of the early twentieth century, when the agricultural sector was the basis of the American economy. The manufacturing industry reached its peak in the fifties, when it employed about thirty-five percent of the workforce. In the early thirties, manufacturing still had a significant share of employment, around twenty-five percent of the workforce. By contrast, the services sector showed a strong growth trend in the same period: from about forty percent in the early thirties, it increased to eighty-one percent in 2010. During the 1970s, the manufacturing industry began to decline due to the introduction of cheap labor from other countries, and by 2010 it was down to about ten percent. The employment pattern in the United States from 1930 to 2010 shows a clear change from agriculture and manufacturing to the predominantly service economy, which reflects the greater economic and technological changes that have taken place in the American labor market over the years. This growth is largely due to the transition from an industrial to a knowledge-based economy and the increasing demand for services such as health care, education and information technology in a modern society.
568;The graph below shows changes in global food and oil prices between 2000 and 2011.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The graph indicates food price and oil price both how to change in the worldwide scale during 2000 to 2011. Their fluctuations of price were similar.In 2000, food price was 90 points, and oil price was $30. Then, both prices had slowly increased till 2007. Suddenly, food price and oil price both had a drastic jump in 2008. Separately, food index price reached to 220 points，meanwhile oil price was beyond $220 where was the highest price in the historical record. Strangely, both prices dropped sharply in 2009, food price returned to 140 points same as the previous price in 2007, and oil price returned to less $40 same as the previous price in 2005. However, since 2009, food price and oil price both performed a shaking tendency. Finally, food price reached to the new highest points, 140 in 2011, and oil price was weaker than food price, which was $100 in 2011.Global food price and oil price are the two dominant index to expose the change of the global financial market. They interact with each other.; Starting with oil, between 2000 and 2003 the price per barrel remained between $25 and $30. A closer look at the graph reveals that oil and food prices followed different paths, reflecting the underlying economic processes. The oil price showed a significant upward trend in 2004 and increased rapidly, reaching a high of $140 per barrel in June 2008. The subsequent decline led to a sharp drop in the price per barrel, which fell to below $40 by the end of 2008. The subsequent recovery was slow and steady, leading to a final value of around $100 per barrel in 2011. In contrast, food prices began at a lower level in 2000, and were relatively stable until 2006. Then the price began to rise steadily, reaching a peak of more than $200 in mid-2008. This peak was followed by a period of decline, after which the price fell to about $125 in 2011. By comparing the two lines, it is clear that both prices showed a peak in 2008, but the pattern and timing of the increases were different. The oil price was highly volatile, and the price of food was less volatile, showing a consistent but less dramatic pattern. These patterns reflected the complex relationship between energy and food production in the world market. To conclude, from 2000 to 2011, the price of oil and food showed significant fluctuations, with the oil price fluctuating more than the price of food.
898;The graph below shows how money was spent on different forms of entertainment over a five year period.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The provided barr chart depicts the proportion of money spent on several entertainment categories in three different locations from 1995 to 2000.Overall, television in the US was the entertainment sector with the highest income in 2000, whereas, cinema and video received the lowest income over the same 5 years period in the three locations.The barr chart shows that television had the highest amount of money in 2000 reaching 100 out of 257. In contrast, in 1995, the US television had just above 50 out of 184. Similarly, television in Europe had the same income of the latter in 2000.On the other hand, cinema and video categories were the sectors with the lowest income of the three locations. In Asia, for example, cinema and television represent just a small fraction of the income. Similar patterns can be seen in Europe and the US.; The graph shows how spending on cinemas and concerts started to rise and then started to fall again. Spending on films and concerts started to rise almost parallel to each other and remained at its highest level in the third year. Spending on both fell in the following two years. Both remained at the same level for the last two years, but spending on cinemas dropped to about $190 million, and spending on concerts to about $180 million. Spending on films began at about  150 million and rose to  220 million in the third year. Spending on concerts began at  100 million and rose to  180 million. The trend for spending on games and on entertainment by cable was the opposite. Spending on games began at $80 million and rose to $200 million. Streaming services rose considerably in the last two years. Starting at about $70 million, spending rose to about $250 million. The rapid rise shows the growing trend for digital content and technology in the field of entertainment. In general, spending on entertainment by streaming has exceeded spending on other forms of entertainment, and the overall trend is that digital entertainment has taken the place of traditional entertainment.
852;The graph below shows information on employment rates across 6 countries in 1995 and 2005.Summarise the information by choosing and describe the main idea, and make comparisons where appropriate.;The bar chart sheds light on how employment rates of each gender changed from 1995 to 2005 in six nations: Australia, Switzerland, Iceland, Britain, New Zealand and the United States.Overall, there are mainly two trends suggested by this diagram. First, the employment rates of males were higher than those of females in both 1995 and 2005 across all six countries. Second, this period witnessed an increase in the employment rates of both genders in all countries.As shown in this graph, the large gender gap of employment took place in Iceland, Australia and New Zealand where the difference of employment percentage between males and females reached approximately 30% in both 1995 and 2005. In the other countries, the difference was between 10% and 15%.It is also apparent that an increase of around 10%-15% in employment proportions appeared in each gender across all nations, especially in Australia where the percentage of employed men rose from about 56% to 70% while that of employed women went up from nearly 26% to 38%.; First of all, it is clear that most countries have increased their employment rates over the decade. The data reveals a distinct change in employment across the countries. The figures show that there has been a rise in employment across the board. This is evident from the increase in employment rates in all countries. Notably, country A has increased its employment rate from 60 percent in 1995 to an impressive 75 percent in 2005. Country B has also seen a significant increase from 55 to 70 percent, indicating a positive shift in its labour market. Country C has risen from 58 to 72 percent, whereas Country D has risen from 50 to 55 percent, and Country E has risen from 45 to 48 percent. This represents a slower but steady progress. In contrast, Country F has been the only country to have seen its employment rate fall, from 58 percent in 1995 to 52 percent in 2005. It would be interesting to know whether this was due to a change in employment policies, or whether it reflected the broader economic situation. The information indicates that the employment rate is influenced by a variety of factors including economic factors and employment policies.
1018;The graph below shows the amounts of waste produced by three companies over a period of 15 years.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The line graph gives us informations about how much tonnes of waste is created by three companies between the year 2000 and 2015. It can be observed that majority of the companies reduced their waste in this period and become more eco-friendly.Overall, while company A nd B were reducing their waste, company C provided more waste from 2000 to 2015. Also, company B recorded significant drop from 2005 to 2015.Taking a closer look at the graph, it can be seen that company A created the most waste in the beginning. They recorded 12 tonnes of wastes in the year 2000, however, they reduced their waste consistently in the following years and produced less than 9 tonnes in 2015. Unfortunetly, company C increased their waste records in this period. While they produced little over 3 tonnes of waste in 2000, they rose this record regularly to over 9 tonnes in 2015.On the other hand, company B increased their waste from 2000 to 2005 with reaching over 9 tonnes in 2005 from around 8 tonnes in 2000. However, there is a major drop between 2005 and 2015. They decreased their waste from over 9 tonnes in 2005 to 3 tonnes in 2015.; Initially, in the first five years, Company A produced more waste than the other two companies, 12,000 tons in the first year. It is clear from the chart that the amount of waste produced by the three companies is subject to certain changes and trends. Company B's initial waste generation is 8,000 tons, but it has increased sharply in the following years. However, the next year it began to fall and at the end of the 15-year period, the amount of waste produced is about 5,000 tons. This trend suggests that the waste management of Company A is more effective, or that the sustainable practices of the company are more sustainable. The waste generation of Company B has reached 15,000 tons in the tenth year, and it seems to have a certain impact on waste reduction policy or inefficiency in production. However, it seems that this level of waste production can not be maintained in the following years, so the amount of waste produced is about 10,000 tons at the end of the 15-year period. This means that although Company B has not changed a lot in the amount of waste produced, the company's waste management policy is not very effective. Company C's initial waste generation is slightly lower than that of Company B, and the amount of waste produced is about 7,500 tons, and the amount of waste produced is still around 10,000 tons at the end of the 15-year period. Company C's amount of waste produced is relatively stable, but its management policy is not very good. Finally, this shows that although the waste generation of the three companies has different characteristics, there are different degrees of success in the implementation of waste reduction policy.
1238;The graph below shows the number of enquiries received by the Tourist Information Office in one city over a six-month period in 2011.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram given illustrates the number of enquiries received by Tourist Information Office from January to June, a period of six months. Overall enquiries received in persons have shown an increasing pattern in all phases, while the data received by letter or email have shown a declining trend and information received by telephone shows a fluctuating trend.In the month of January, the higheset value in which method in which enquiries were received by telephone with a value of nearly 900 and the lowest amount is 450 and that is in person.In sharp contrast to this, information received by in person and by letter shows the values of 1900 and 1600 respectively, while the information received by either letters or emails habe shown a continuous declining trend from January to May from 750 to 350 approximately and it has remained constant from May to June at the amount of 300.; This analysis is an attempt to give a general account of the main trends, high and low points in the figures. The graph below, which shows the number of enquiries received by the tourist office over a six-month period in 2011, reveals significant fluctuations in interest in the city. In the first month, January, the number of enquiries started at a medium level. The figures then increased dramatically in February and continued rising until March, the peak month of the period, possibly reflecting popular local events and holidays, which attracted the attention of both locals and visitors. This peak was followed by a significant drop in April. The number of enquiries recovered slightly in May, indicating an increase in tourist activity or better marketing. In comparison with May, June was slightly lower than the previous month, although it was still above the figure for January. The data clearly show a high initial interest in tourism followed by a significant drop in April and a partial recovery in May and June. These figures can be used to inform future tourism strategy, to ensure that the interest of visitors is maintained throughout the year. In conclusion, the data show a dynamic six-month tourist interest, with initial growth, a significant drop in April and a partial recovery.
14;The graph below shows the number of overseas visitors to three different areas in a European country between 1987 and 2007Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The graph below illustrates the amount of overseas visitors to three different places ( the coast, the mountains, the lakes ) in a European country between the period 1987 to 2007. The unit used in the graph is thousandsOverall, the lakes had the lowest amount of visitors in the graph in 1987 by 10 thousand visitors in oppose the coast had the most number of visitors in the graph in 2007 by slightly over 70 thousand visitors. The mountains had the lowest amount of visitors in all the times visitors combined while the coast and the lakes were really close to each other in the overall amount of vistors nearly the same amount of visitors.In the period from 1987 to 1992 The coast had the highest number of visitors by approximately 40 thousand visitors while the lakes had the lowest number of visitors by nearly 10 thousand visitors and the mountains were the middle between them by slightly over 20 thousand visitors.In the period from 1992 to 1997 the coast also was the highest number of visitors by around 40 thousand visitors in meantime the lakes was lower than the mountains it was above 15 by littile and the mountains were above 25 but the lakes suprisingly rocketed and achived the mountains even went more by 30 thousand approximately.; In the first place, A started with about 10 million tourists in 1987, which increased gradually and steadily, and in 2007 it exceeded 15 million. In general, A attracted the highest number of tourists, while B experienced a steady rise and C fluctuated. B, on the other hand, had about 4 million tourists in 1987, and in 2007 the number of tourists reached about 9 million, so it seems that the area B has improved the amenities in recent years and has also become a tourist attraction. This upward trend can be attributed to the success of the area's tourist promotion and the improvement of the tourist environment. C had about 5 million tourists in 1987, but the trend is very uncertain, and after a sharp decline in the early 1990s, the number of tourists fell sharply, but the number of tourists was only about 3.1 million in 1995. The steady increase in B is in sharp contrast to the changes in C. The number of tourists in C has fluctuated greatly, and there are no obvious characteristics in this regard. In the end, the number of tourists reached about 4 million in 2007, and this can be attributed to many factors, such as the general economic situation, the seasonal attraction and the competition between different areas.
972;The graph below shows the number of university graduates in Canada from 1992 to 2007.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The following line graph provides details about the number of university graduates in Canada over a fifteen-year period from 1992, dividing into two genders.Overall, it can be inferred from the graph that there were upward trends in the number of university graduates of the two sexes. The first thing to note is that from the beginning in 1992, female university graduates outnumbered the number of graduates of the opposite sex. In spite of the noticeable increase in the number of male graduates, the distance still became larger in the year 2006. In 2006, the distance between the two sectors climbed from 30000 in 1992 to more than 50000.Although there was a fluctuation in the number of female graduates, there was an enormous rise from approximately 100000 in 1992 to almost 150000 in 2006. For the opposite gender, we can see more fluctuations though it was still an upward trend. The number of male university graduates grew from 70000 to around 95000 over a period of fifteen years from 1992 to 2006.; In 1992, there were about 150,000 graduates, with about 80,000 male graduates. The graph shows a significant rise in the number of university graduates from 1992 to 2007. It also shows the changing percentage of graduates by gender. In the years up to the year 2000, the total number of graduates had grown significantly to around 200,000, and female graduates were beginning to catch up with male graduates. There was a steady decrease in the percentage of male graduates, and the number of female graduates was beginning to rise. By the year 2005, there were almost 250,000 graduates, and the number of female graduates exceeded that of male graduates for the first time. The number of male graduates dropped to 46,000, while the number of female graduates rose to 56,000. Consequently, the number of graduates in Canada climbed to 275,000 in 2007. The main reason for this was the continued rise in the number of female graduates. The change in trend is indicative of not only a change in the educational system, but also a change in society regarding gender equality and access to higher education. The rise in the number of female graduates shows that society’s view of gender equality in education is also changing. In summary, the trend in the number of graduates in Canada from 1992 to 2007 is a positive one.
1258;The graph below shows the percentage of people going to cinemas in one European country on different days.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of people going to cinemas in one European country on different days of the week over a three-year period from 2003 to 2007.Overall, the amount of people deciding to spend time at the movie theatre from 2003 to 2007 fluctuated considerably during weekdays, with the vast majority of people opting to go to the cinemas on Saturdays. Interestingly, the percentage of people choosing to go to the cinemas on Fridays remained stable at 30% through the whole three years.In 2003, only one in ten people decided to go to the cinemas on Mondays, as opposed to the two fifths of people choosing to go on Saturdays and the just under a third of people opting for Sundays. In 2005, the trend experienced a downward trend during weekdays but eventually rose significantly to just under a half and just over a third during weekends, outracing the rate of 2003 and 2007. Lastly, in 2007 the rate continued to present considerable fluctuations, hitting a high point of approximately two fifths on Saturdays.; The information shows that cinema attendance varies from day to day. It can be seen that on Saturdays and Sundays attendance increases sharply. Compared to this, attendance is significantly lower on weekdays. On Saturdays, about 45% of people go to the cinema, which reflects the general interest in leisure on the weekend. On Sundays, attendance drops to about 40%, which shows that although people go to the cinema on the weekend, Saturday is undoubtedly the most popular day. This sharp contrast shows that weekdays are usually used for business or learning, and so attendance is lower on weekdays. On Mondays and Tuesdays, cinema attendance is at its lowest, at about 12% and 10% respectively. The overall pattern of the information is that attendance on weekdays is much lower than on the weekend, especially on Saturdays. This increase towards the end of the week may indicate that people start to prepare for the weekend, which corresponds to the peak of cinema attendance on Saturdays. In this way, the information reveals the role of social and entertainment activities in the choice of people’s leisure time, which is significantly influenced by their working week.
1280;The graph below shows the proportion of the population aged 65 and over between 1940 and 2040 in three different countries.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The line chart depicts by percentage the population aged 65 and over in three countries Japan , USA and Sweden , between 1940 and 2040.Overall , the figure shows that population in Japan would be expected to have highest percentage in alderly by 2040 . Meanwhile USA expected to have the lowest rate .A closer examination of the graph , it's seem that population in Japan was at low point in 1940 with 5% and remain relatively stable till 2020 .Afterwards the trend shows increase slightly to 10% in 2025However, speculation of dramatic growth in trend after 2025 to reach 27% by 2040. Meanwhile in Sweden the data started 7% in 1940 .Athough the trend went up and down till 2020 with 15%.Nevertheless, expected to raise considerably to 25% in 2040.Likewise, in USA the data shows fluctuations starting with 10% in 1940 and expected to end by 23 % in 2040 .; In 1940, country A had the lowest percentage of elderly people at 9%, country B had 11% and country C was 12%. These figures demonstrate the relatively youthful population of these three countries at that time. As the century progresses, we can observe marked changes in the age structure of the three countries. By 2000, country C had a substantial increase in the elderly population, which rose to around 25%, country B had an increase of about 20% and country A remained at about 15%. These changes are evidence of improved life expectancy and medical care in country C, which maintained the highest proportion of elderly people. Country B showed a steady increase to about 26% and country A a slight decrease to about 21%. Looking forward to 2040, projections show a dramatic increase in the proportion of elderly people in all three countries. This graph shows that an increase in the elderly population is a common feature of these three countries, with implications for the provision of medical care, pensions and social security. The projections of the future for all three countries suggest that they will have to adapt to an increase in the elderly population.
1182;The graph shows Underground Station passenger numbers in London.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The line graph illustrates the Underground Station passenger numbers in London which were recorded between the time of 6.00 am to 22.00 pm.Overall, at 8.00 am the number of passengers recorded the highest value which was 400, also the number of passengers at 18.00 pm was about 380. That said it's clear those times had the highest value due to the people going to their work and people leaving.On the other hand, at 10.00 am the number of passengers decreased dramatically to 180. In addition from 12.00 pm to 14.00 pm, the number of passengers slightly increased from 280 to 310. There was a sharp decrease from 14.00 pm to 16.00 pm in the number of passengers where it reached 100. Also, another sudden drop from 18.00 pm to 20.00 pm in the number of passengers occurred where was recorded 120.Furthermore, at 6.00 am and 16.00 pm the number of passengers recorded almost the same value of 100. It can be concluded people's busy time during the day can affect the number of passengers that take the underground station.; Firstly, it is evident that certain stations, such as King’s Cross and Waterloo, are continually recording the highest numbers of passengers. Secondly, it is possible to identify distinct patterns and trends, allowing a deeper understanding of the passenger behaviour in the Underground. In comparison, Arsenal and Upminster show much lower figures, as their suburban location, lack of accessibility and minimal links to other stations are to blame. The highest number of passengers can be seen at King’s Cross, reflecting the importance of the station as a railway terminal and its role as a key gateway to the rest of the world, with the arrival of the Eurostar service from the capital. Waterloo comes in a close second, due to its central location, near tourist and business attractions and to the close proximity of the Bank of England. Moreover, the graph also shows noticeable peaks during the weekdays, especially during the morning and evening rush hours, which corresponds to the daily commute of London’s workforce, as the Underground is used to transport them to and from work. This shows the difference between the accessibility and convenience of the stations, and thus the number of passengers they attract. Accordingly, a clearer picture can be seen, enabling us to determine how to improve the system, so as to be more efficient and more in tune with the needs of the passengers. Finally, a noticeable dip in the weekday numbers, a drop that is not seen on the weekend, suggests that leisure travellers behave in a different way to the working population.
396;The graphs below show the enrolments of overseas students and local students in Australian universities over a ten year period.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The two graphs compare the development of the students' enrollments for both groups of local and overseas students in Australian universities between the year of 2001 and 2010. Considering the overall trend of both of the groups for the commencing category, the trend seems to be positive with overseas students, while being quite stagnated within the local students.The total number of enrollments associates with a relatively different development compared to the commencing category. For the overseas students, the trend is strongly possively correlated among the whole period, while for the local students, the positive trend has stopped at year 2007 at the rate of 600000 enrolments per year.For the commencing category, the trend has been over the years relatively positive for the overseas students, except between 2009 and 2010. On the other side, the number of enrolments of local students has slightly degraded in the same period.To summarize, the accumulation of the number of enrolments of both local and overseas students is different and utilizes different trends in the same periods. Neverthless, for the total number of students the difference is not enormous, but rather stagnating for the local students starting at 2007.; From the data, it is evident that overseas enrolments in Australian universities increased during the decade, beginning at approximately 150,000 in the early years and rising to over 400,000 at the end of the period, an increase of over 160%. The increase can be attributed to Australia’s reputation as an ideal place for international students to study because of its high-quality institutions, diverse programs and its multicultural environment. The local enrolments, on the other hand, began at just over 600,000, peaking at approximately 650,000 and then falling to just under 600,000 at the end of the decade. The increase in overseas enrolments is particularly prominent in the second half of the decade. It indicates an upward trend which can be attributed to the international marketing strategies and the growing importance of higher education in the world. Local enrolments, on the other hand, represent the vast majority of the students. This trend may indicate a number of factors, such as changes in the demography, socioeconomic factors influencing the students’ decision to study, and a change in the market structure. In summary, the trends indicate a notable divergence between the increase in overseas enrolments and the stagnant trend of local enrolments in Australian universities. This demonstrates a dynamic change in the educational system, highlighting the importance of adjusting strategies to retain local students while accommodating the increasing demand from overseas students.
912;The graphs below show the number of men and women in full and part-time employment in Australia between 1973 and 1993.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;"The graphs compare the participation of full-time and part-time workers in Australia as differenciated by gender and age group in the period betweeen 1973 and 1993.Overall, it is clearly seen that the number of full-time workers for both male and female experienced a slight decline as part-time work become more favourable among these employees. Moreover, despite their gender, there are more people in the age group of 15-19 years old employed for part-time jobs.Based on the age group, it is illustrated that the number of full-time and part-time male workers between 25-49 years old has no significant difference. However, the lines indicated that for female employees the number of people working full-time and part-time were more fluctuated, meaning that age group influenced their employment status. For example, the female employees at the age group of 15-19 years old working full-time was accounted for almost reaching to 50 per cent in 1973, but stepping down to 20 per cent in 1993; while part-time workers at the same age group has a higher number 1993 compared to those who worked in 1973 by around 32 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively."; This data clearly reveals the changing roles of women and men in the Australian workforce. It is worth noting that the figures distinguish between full-time and part-time work, which allows us to see clearly the changing role of women and men in the workforce over the two decades under review. In 1973 there were approximately 2.3 million men employed full-time, whereas in 1993 this figure had fallen to around 1.8 million. This shows a notable trend in the decline of full-time employment for men. On the other hand, the number of women employed full-time has more than doubled from about 0.4 million in 1973 to about 1.0 million in 1993. In contrast, the graphs show that the number of women working part-time has risen dramatically from around 1.3 million in 1973 to about 3.1 million in 1993. This increase reflects the changing social attitudes to women’s roles in the workplace and their increasing involvement in paid employment. As for men, the figures for part-time employment have remained relatively stable over the period in question, fluctuating between approximately 0.5 and 0.7 million. This illustrates the view that part-time work was less desirable for men, who traditionally preferred full-time positions. This increase may be partly explained by an increased acceptance of flexible working arrangements, which is probably due to the fact that women have traditionally played a dual role as primary carer and worker. This breakdown of the traditional gender roles indicates a broader change in society, which will continue to have an effect on the workforce in the future. In conclusion, the data show a significant change in the roles of men and women in the Australian workforce between 1973 and 1993.
1056;The graphs below show the numbers of male and female workers in 1975 and 1995 in several employment sectors of the Republic of Freedonia.Write a report for a university teacher describing the information shown.;The chart gives information about the number of female and male employees divided by six different sectors (manufacturing, communications, finance/banking, wholesale & retail trade, non-defence public sector and defence public sector) in the year 1975. Overall, male employees outraced female in manufacturing, finance/banking and defence public sector. While in communications, wholesales & retail trade and non-defence public sector, female workers were higher in the year 1975.In manufacturing, number of male employees was slightly higher than female workers by about 280 thousands. Turning to the finance/banking sector, male employees was three-fold more than female workers. Moreover, men work in defence public sector also made up the biggest part of the total number of employees by approximately 190 thousands.The number of female workers exceeded male employees in three sectors. First, the communications sector, which male workers were less than 50 thousands, while the number of female workers were around 240 thousands. Second, the wholesale & retail trade, the female employees were over 450 thousands but the male workers were lower than 100 thousands. Last sector is the non-defence public sector, the total employees were the highest among others, with about 640 thousands female workers and 200 thousands male workers only.; The distribution of workers in the Republic of Freedonia in the two decades is clearly seen. There are noticeable changes in the percentage of each gender in the various employment sectors. In 1995, the proportion of male workers in manufacturing decreased to 66%, and in construction it decreased to 85%. On the other hand, the female percentage in education and health services was much higher, at 75% and 60%, respectively. The educational service remained strongly dominated by women, nearly 80%, while health care continued to have a strong female presence, around 70%. This shows a tendency to accept and include women in the traditionally male professions. In conclusion, it is seen that in the Republic of Freedonia, from 1975 to 1995, the ratio of women to men in the various professions has been steadily improving. Interestingly, a new trend is visible in the technology sector, where the percentage of women increased from 10% in 1975 to 30% in 1995. This is a very positive trend, which can be seen as a result of increasing opportunities for women in emerging areas. The greater participation of women in all fields indicates an increasingly dynamic and progressive labour market. While in some fields, the traditional gender roles remain, in others there is progress, especially in the former male-dominated fields.
1216;The graphs below show the types of music albums purchased by people in Britain according to sex and age.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The table charts give information about the type of music album that people of different sex and age have bought in Britain. Rock Music is generally the top sellers. The class of people between 25 and 34 years old buy more albums than the others.Rock music is the the more sold type, whereas classical music is the less purchased. However, there is a divergence concerning the type of listeners of the two types of music. Indeed, Rock Music (the most listened type) is particularly listened by people who are aged between 16-35, they exceed the 30%. Instead, Classical Music is particularly interesting for adults which are aged over 45. Indeed, the more than 20% of people of this age buy classical music. By contrast, the yungers, between 16 and 24 years old, who listened to classical music are almost 0%. Pop music, is the second more purchased type. It is purchased by all the types of people even if no one of the class exceed 30% of buyers.There is a difference that concerns the age of people and their musical interests. Nonetheless, people beteen 25 and 35 year old are those who by the most and different types of music. They purchase around 30% of Rock Music's albums, even if the type they buy the most is Rock Music. They are also interested in buying Classical Music. In the opposite position, there are people aged over 45, who are the less versatile listeners. They used to buy Classical Music album (around the 20%) but less that 10% of them buy Pop or Rock Music.; This shows that women bought pop music most of all, despite their ages. It is also clear that pop music has its own peak at the 16-24 age group. In general, it is clear that different musical genres are popular with different sexes and different ages. It is also interesting that while men are less consistent in music tastes, they still prefer rock music, especially the 25-34-year-old age group. This means that although younger men can be seen buying pop music, as they grow older, they become more and more inclined to buy rock music. This could mean that marketing young women in the pop music genre would be successful. And it is also interesting that, if you look at the age groups, the people aged 16 to 24 generally prefer modern music such as hip-hop and pop, and as they grow older, they become more and more inclined to listen to the classics, especially in the 45-54 and 55+ age groups, which shows a relationship between age and nostalgia for music. Also, there are differences in the preference of different sexes: males prefer rock and jazz, and females prefer pop and classical music. This could indicate a difference in the cultural values of men and women and their music consumption. This provides an understanding of music marketing to different groups of people. In conclusion, the graphs show the different kinds of music albums that people in Britain buy, influenced by their age and sex.
874;The illustrations show two stages in the development of the mobile phone. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The illustration indicate different type of mobile phones from distinct era.On the whole, it is clear that there are different perform functions, sizes and weight between these two type of mobile phone. Actually, the contemporary mobile phone is more advanced than the other.Looking more closely in the illustration, one can see that both of them is designed a ear phone on top of the phone as well as a keyboard which are setted under the screen. However, the screen of the former is displayed with black and white, the latter is displayed with full-colour. Moreover, the contemporary mobile phone is setted within different kind of functions such as camera with video capability, e-mail internet music player, multi-player game facility, while the early one is designed without such a series of functions which only has a function select button on the middle of the phone.Furthermore, it is apparent that the size of these phones are different too. According to the illustration, the early one is bigger than the contemporary one, respresenting the former is 130mm and 50mm, and the latter is 90mm and 40mm which can be folded. In addition, the weight of newer one is much lighter than the other, accounting for 70g and 150g, respectively.; The first stage, a mobile phone from the early nineties, is a big, rectangular, bulky device. This early model, nicknamed a brick phone, had a small, monochrome display and a keypad that was only able to support a few functions. This type of device served mainly as a telephone. The second stage, a modern smart phone, is sleek and slim, with a touch-screen that revolutionises how the phone can be used. Its large battery provided power for a long time but also made it cumbersome. This difference in size and weight highlights a significant change in how the mobile phone is used. The earlier models were primarily telephones but smart phones have a much wider range of uses, for communication, productivity and entertainment. As the above shows, mobile phones have moved from a basic communication tool to an advanced technological device. They have also changed considerably in recent decades, in line with the changing demands of consumers and with changing lifestyles.
1104;The line graph below shows the number of annual visits to Australia by overseas residents. The table below gives information on the country of origin where the visitors came from.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information given.;"The table illustrates how many people had visited Australia (in million) in two precise years (1975 and 2005), making a comparison based on from which country these people came from.The line graph below outlines the quantity of overseas residents that had gone to Australia from 1975 to the following 3 decades.------------------------PARAGRAH----------------------------Overall, according to the table, 30 years after 1975 people who were visiting Australia increased from all the countries.Regarding to the line graph, the 4 decades were characterized by a sharp climb.------------------------PARAGRAH----------------------------Furthermore, referring to the table, a considerable growth of the total number of visitors was seen (from 8.8 to 30.4); the most noticeable rise was recorded for Japanese people (from 3.2 to 12), whilst the least one was for the Chinese one (only 0.5 million of difference).------------------------PARAGRAH----------------------------In addition, speaking of the number of overseas residents that had visited Australia, it was around 9 million in 1975; 10 years later it went up to 16 million more or less, reaching 25 million in 1995.Lastly, in the first 5 years of the 21st century, Australia was visited by 32 million of them circa."; From the line graph it can be seen that the number of visitors to Australia has fluctuated over the two decades, but there is a clear upward trend from 2000 to 2019. In the year 2000 there were about 5.1 million visitors to Australia, and by the year 2019 the number had risen to about 9 million, which is the highest figure recorded during the period in question. It was in the year 2020, however, that the number of visitors fell sharply as a result of the Covid virus, which led to the cancellation of international flights. The number of visitors plummeted to about 2 million, indicating how severely the outbreak of the virus affected international travel. Various factors have contributed to the increase in the number of visitors, such as the easing of travel restrictions, the influx of overseas residents to Australia, and the growth of the interest of foreigners in travelling to Australia. From the table it can be seen that visitors from New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States account for a large proportion of visitors to Australia. During some years, the number of visitors from New Zealand exceeded 1.5 million. The information on the number of visitors from these countries will be useful for policymakers and for those who are concerned with the rehabilitation of the tourism industry. The data clearly indicate the resilience and vulnerability of the tourism industry in Australia. The seasonal variation in numbers is striking.
638;The line graph below shows the oil production and consumption in China between 1982 and 2006.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;This line graph indicates oil production and consumption per day in China from 1982 to 2006. Clearly, the consumption doubled its production in 2006.To begin with, oil consumption started the millions of oil barrels per day for almost two, and remained the same by 1990. But, its consumption suddenly surged to about 3.7 million in 1994. Then, the number of consumption skyrocketed from 1998 and reached a peak of more than 6 million in 2006. Consequently, the consumption tripled, compared with 1982.Secondly, the production also commenced the millions of oil barrels per day around two, and increased its production to three million in 1986. In contrast, its production leveled off by 1994. Afterward, the production slightly kept going up and resulted in 3.5 million in 2006. As a result, the oil production increased, compared with 1982. But it is clear that the pace of production is quite slower than consumption.; The line graph of the oil production and consumption in China from 1982 to 2006 shows that the production was about 2 million barrels per day in the first year and the consumption was about 1.5 million barrels per day, so the total is more than the consumption. This is a small surplus, which may be an indicator of the developing economy at that time. But in the next year, the production increased gradually, and by the end of the year, the consumption exceeded the production, indicating that the country's energy consumption has increased sharply, which is probably due to the reform and development of China's economy. From 1982 to the middle of 1993, China's oil production was still rising, and the total was around 4 million barrels per day, indicating that the total energy consumption in China had been increasing, and this is the result of China's economic reform and development during this period. Then, after 1993, China's oil production and consumption were no longer in harmony, and the production gradually decreased, and the total was about 5 million barrels per day in 2006. However, the consumption was still rising, and the total consumption was more than 6 million barrels per day. The overall trend is that China's oil consumption has been rising, and the production has not been enough to meet the huge energy needs of the country, so China has relied heavily on oil imports. The situation not only reflects China's rapid economic development, but also China's vulnerability to the international oil market. At the end of the year, the gap between oil production and oil consumption was still large, and China urgently needed to meet the energy needs of the country. The next step of China's economic and environmental policy is to consider the development of China's energy and environment.
120;The map and chart below show the information for the global willingness to eat insect products and the current price for certain food available on the market place.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The map and chart gives information on each country's preference to try insect products and the price for food on the market.On the map, the countries with high willingness to try insect products are marked yellow to green, while low tolerance countries are marked red to orange. Over half of Mexico, Peru, and Thailand's populations are willing to try insect products, making them the top 3 countries. On the contrary, Japan had an extremely low percentage in 21%.It is evident on the chart that glutinous rice is the the cheapest food product with $0.82/kg, followed by rice, chicken, pork, buffalo, beef, in that respective order. The chart indicates that the most expensive food is weaver ant, with $10.65/kg. There is an apparent trend in the price of insects, they are less affordable compared to other sources of protein. However, water bugs and house crickets are exceptions to that particular trend. It is also worth noting that male water bugs are more expensive than the female water bugs.; According to the map, countries are colored according to the percentage of people willing to eat insect products. The chart shows the average price of various food products on the market. On the contrary, the willingness to eat insects in the West is significantly lower. In the United States and Europe, the percentage of acceptance is between 20 and 30 percent. Southeast Asian countries, especially in the country such as Thailand and Vietnam, are most eager to eat insects, where more than 70 percent of people are willing to try insects. This is largely due to the local gastronomic tradition and the historical use of insects as a source of nutrition. The chart shows the average price of food and demonstrates the price of beef, chicken and vegetable protein in comparison with the cost of insect products. It is interesting that insects are cheaper than beef, but are the same as chicken and vegetable products. This difference largely reflects the differences in cultural habits and views of edible insects as a source of nutrition, which is often seen with disbelief or disgust in the West. In general, the presented information demonstrates significant differences in the acceptance of insect products and the position of the insect products in the market. In addition, the question of sustainable food and food security is very important, since insects could be a more sustainable and less environmentally harmful way of producing nutrition than traditional livestock.
882;The map below shows three possible locations for a leisure centre. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;This map describes the possible areas for a leisure centre. It is clear from the graph that the three selected areas have different characterestics which make each of them as unique place.According to what is shown, place A is very close to some industries and that make it unsuitable to be a leisure center. Moreover, this area is not healthy due to the pollution that comes from the industries' smok.For the second area (B), this location is close to the some buildings where people live and that is good choice. However, the only negative of this place is that it will be noise. However, location C is the beast due to its location. It is located faraway from any kind of pollution. People can breath fresh air and enjoy the grean areas.To summarize, we could say that, location C has several positives that make it the best choice for a leisure centre.; You will need the following information: a. Location A is situated on the north side of a suburb, near a school and a park. This location is family-friendly and would be easily accessible for schoolchildren and nearby residents. b. Location B is located in the middle of a town, near a shopping centre, near grocery shops and cafes. This central location offers good visibility and easy access, so that it could attract a wide range of customers, including families, young people and seniors. However, it is less convenient for people coming from other areas. c. Location C is situated at the edge of the suburb, near a highway. This location is easily accessible from other towns, but it is far from the residential area, which may limit daily foot traffic. Being close to commercial centres may increase the popularity of the centre and make it the focal point of the community. In summary, while location A is very family-friendly and community-minded, location B is easier to reach and more centrally located, and location C is less dependent on the local community. Comparing the three locations is necessary for deciding which one would best serve the community.
938;The maps below show the development of a small fishing village and its surrounding area into a large European tourist resort.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The map illustrates on how a fishing village with a population of 12,000 people in 1974 has been converted to a European tourist resort in 2004 which can accommodate 80,000 residents and 50,000 tourist beds.Except for the fishing village, all other places were modified.It is apparent from the map that there has been a huge loss of flora and fauna on this restructure. Dense woodland was replaced with hotels and golf course. Areas allocated for sheep and goats and olives cultivation were converted into tourist shops and farmland for harvesting fruits and vegetables to serve tourists at hotels.A portion of village, harbour and place were boats were stationed has been relocated to accommodate tourists to have a sea view.A pathway has been created from top of the mountain to the beach to facilitate tourist travel different destinations.Consequently, there has been a huge loss in habitat and probably a shift in fishermen jobs. For survival, fishermen would have taken up jobs like working in tourist shops, serving tourists at restaurant and guiding tourists.; At first, the fishing village was a small rural village with a few houses clustered near the shore, a fish market, and a road out of the village. The surrounding area was predominantly rural, with agriculture and natural vegetation dominating the landscape. The changes in the layout, buildings, and surroundings are evident. The village was transformed into a tourist resort, with hotels, restaurants, and various entertainments. The village was isolated, offering little service for visitors. Furthermore, the old road was replaced by a highway that connected the village with nearby cities and tourist destinations. The highway not only improved access to the resort, but also showed urban planning with a view to accommodating increasing tourist numbers. The change from a quiet fishing economy to a bustling tourist industry with the help of tourist industry is evident. The main emphasis of the resort is leisure. The development of the resort is evidenced by significant changes in transport and land use, and a shift towards a more diverse economy that capitalizes on the picturesque coastal setting for mass tourism. The natural beauty of the coast has been preserved, but complemented by man-made entertainments that enhance the experience of visitors. The emergence of a tourist economy also reveals the changes in the local economy and the community’s sense of identity. This has also created new opportunities and problems.
825;The movement of people from the countryside into the cities is happening in many parts of the world, resulting in the problems, especially in cities.What are the causes of this movement, and how can it be reversedGive reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;People move from the countryside into the cities. It occurs in many parts of the world, causing problems, especially in urban areas. This essay will elaborate on the causes of this movement, and the way it can be reversed from my personal standpoint.Centralization has caused this movement. All the major institutions and facilities are in the cities. Thus, people in rural areas have to sacrifice considerable time and effort to travel to urban centres. As it is also costly, people choose to move into the cities so that traveling does not consume their time. For instance, one-fifth of the total population in Korea currently lives in Seoul, the capital city of Korea. In fact, all the educational, medical, and entertainment facilities are centralized in urban areas. It can be reserved by implementing decentralization. The government has to disperse the location of the major institutions and diverse types of facilities into different districts so that people living in remote areas can also benefit.Furthermore, people in remote areas want to earn opportunities for better employment or education. As a city is a point where technologies, investments ,and professions gather, there is a better opportunity for people to get employed or educated in a improved quality. Therefore, people choose to leave the countryside. Thereby, the government can initiate the policies in which firms earn benefit when they move their head office to districts. If the firms commence moving, it will produce a great amount of employment.Conclusively, not only the government but also the businesses and institutions have to co-operate to combat problems resulting from a surge in the movement of people from the countryside into the cities.; The movement of people from the countryside into the city, known as urbanization, is occurring at an unprecedented rate in many parts of the world. This movement, fueled by various reasons, has become a major challenge for cities. For example, young people, often young people, migrated to cities to get an education and to achieve career growth, abandoning agriculture, which is no longer profitable. In addition, urban areas generally have a better living standard, better health care, better education, and better entertainment. But the increasing population of cities causes problems such as overcrowded housing, congestion, and overloaded public services. The hope of improving the quality of life and achieving social mobility also makes people leave the countryside. In order to avoid urbanization-related problems, steps should be taken to persuade people to stay in rural areas. This can be achieved by investing in local businesses to create jobs for the younger generation and making rural economies more prosperous. One way to do this is to improve the living conditions in rural areas by investing in the development of rural areas, such as better transport, health care and education. Lastly, by making rural life viable and desirable, the trend of urban migration can be reversed. The global pandemic of the COV19 virus has shown that many people have been able to work from anywhere, and even live in rural areas while working in urban industries. Work-life balance is important to both the cities and the rural areas.
1299;The number of advertisements for charities on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. What is causing this? Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It indeed appears true that the frequency with which advertisements for charities appear both on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. There can be various explanations for this and it can be seen in both a positive and negative light.One explanation for the increase in the number of charity advertisements is that the charities themselves are becoming more aggressive in their marketing. This can also be seen in the common strategy nowadays to encourage a monthly donation, rather than a one-off donation. The increased marketing is apparent too in the increased numbers of ‘street salespeople’, who stop passersby and try to get them to commit to this monthly payment.A second reason for the increase could also be that there have been more charities started and the number of advertisements would therefore increase and become more noticeable. If these charities are all legitimate, this would mean that more help will be getting to causes that need it. The increase in charities could also be explained by a possible increase of humanitarian awareness. People might be now adopting different ideologies that take into account people in less advantageous positions.If the number of advertisements for charities has risen due to the fact that there has been a positive shift in people’s compassionate principles, this surely has to be seen as an optimistic development. If it is due to the fact that governments have been cutting back, it could be seen as a pessimistic development. In addition, if there are more charities asking for more money, this will inevitably mean that the amount of money donated will have to be more thinly spread, which would be a negative development.There could be several reasons for why there are more charity advertisements today. Whatever the reasons, as long as any money is helping people in disadvantageous positions, it must be seen as a positive development.; An increasing number of charities are becoming more common on the Internet and on television. One reason is the increase in global challenges such as climate change, poverty and disease. This increase is caused by a number of factors such as the growing need for social awareness, technological development, and a change in people's values towards altruism. In addition, the digital transformation has provided charities with sophisticated marketing tools to reach out. As these challenges have become more pronounced, they are seeking to engage the public and raise awareness of the issues. For example, there are more campaigns for tackling homelessness or access to clean water, where organizations are looking for donations and volunteers. In this way, the increase in charities may be a positive development as it inspires people to take action and donate to good causes. However, it also has its disadvantages. Social media platforms and streaming services have democratized advertising, making it possible for even smaller organizations to reach a wider audience. In addition, the frequent bombardment of misery and despair can give rise to feelings of helplessness and numbness, instead of inspiring people to take action. In short, the increase in the number of advertisements for charities is largely caused by the urgent social need and the technological development. The most important thing for charities is to achieve a balance between being effective campaigners and maintaining the public's compassion. This balance is crucial to ensuring long-term support for the cause.
466;The picture below shows how a hot balloon works. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features.You should write at least 150 words.;The imagine illustrates how a hot balloon can fly in the sky and which parts is made of.In brief, a hot ballon is composed by a basket, burner where a flame is produced to heat cool air and an envelope connected to it by a skirt and ropes. Hot air is made in order to allow the hot ballon to work.Firstly, the basket welcomes people aboard. Meanwhile, ropes allow to connect the basket to the skirt and the envelope, which is composed by few panels in a vertical lane, multiple gores and a parachute valve. This one is a self-sealing flap that allows hot air to escape a controlled rate.Secondly, Between the skirt and the basket is located a burner which is crucial for the use of the hot balloon. In fact, it has got a propane cylinder that mix this gas with cool air so that ignites a flame to heat the air inside of the envelope. As a result hot air is made, which is lighter than cool air, and allows the hot ballon to fly in the sky.; The diagram shows the functioning of a hot-air balloon and the interaction of its parts. The balloon is attached to the burner, an essential component under the envelope. It is an important feature of the balloon to have a opening on the envelope and a vent on top. The burner is the main source of heat, a flame produced by burning gas, which heats the air inside the balloon. The heated air expands, and, being less dense than the cooler air outside, creates a buoyancy that carries the balloon upwards. The balloon is connected to a basket or gondola that serves as a passenger compartment and houses the fuel tank for the burner. The vent is a source of hot air that can be let out, and which gives the pilot the opportunity to control the balloon's height. By letting out the hot air, the pilot can reduce altitude, and letting in the hot air again, he can increase lift. The combination of the burner, the heated air inside the envelope, and the control system allows the balloon to work effectively and provides the public with a unique and aesthetically pleasing experience of flight. The whole system is light in weight for maximum efficiency and stability, which allows controlled ascent and descent.
170;The picture below shows the plan of a museum in 1998 and after some changes were made in it in 2008. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The picture illustrates different areas of a museum in 1998 and alterations made in 2008.The museum consists of a garden located in the heart of the plan, with exhibition rooms, tickets entrance, shop, toilet, cafe, and bags and coats surrounded by.Take a look of the plan, in 1998, most of the areas in museum were permanent exhibition rooms and a garden in the center of it, however in 2008 exhibition rooms originally on the left side had been replaced with restaurant, temporary exhibition room, bags and coats, and finally the shop.Although garden maintains the same but be added with cafe sitting area and 2 fountains and parts of the area of cafe was distributed to WC after alterations in 2008.Currently, all of the permanent exhibition rooms are on the right side of the museum while others are on the left. Bags and coats , temporary exhibition room occupy a larger area than before the renovation of the museum.;" In 1998, the museum was quite simple, divided into several sections. A careful comparison of the two plans reveals significant changes that improve the functionality and visitor experience of the museum. On the ground floor, there was a large exhibition hall, which was centered; the left side of the entrance led to the museum shop, and on the right side of the wing to the museum restaurant. On the first floor, the extension to the exhibition hall, and a small office, which was used for registration, were also located. The most significant change is that the exhibition hall was divided into two larger ones: exhibitions A and B. A new entrance was opened on the opposite side of the shop, thereby facilitating the entrance to the museum. Another significant change was the relocation of the restaurant. This made it possible to present a wider range of exhibitions. The office was also enlarged, which facilitated the work of museum employees. In general, the changes between 1998 and 2008 were significant and aimed at strategically improving the museum layout for visitors. Through these changes, the museum responded to the needs of visitors and thereby confirmed the importance of the development of public cultural institutions. The new design offers more opportunities for presenting expositions, more space for visitors and better amenities."
650;The pictures show the changes of a park from 1980 to the present day.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The picture illustrates the differences in a park between 1980 and the present. Information is indicated in year 1980 and present, specific locations inside the park and features such as trees, flowers, grass and entertainment facilities.Overall, there have been significant changes in the park from 1980 up to now especially the roads, the flowers, leisure facilities and the south entrance of the park.To begin with, in 1980 the south-west part of the park had four benches but now only three benches are left as a sitting area. Furthermore, in 1980 the park had only white flowers but now has greens grass and blue flowers. In addition, a football area was added in the south-east part of the park with blue flowers on the bottom. In contrast, the number of trees in the north-east part remained the same but now the three trees have different colour and a socializing was added next to the trees. Last but not least, in 1980 the park had only one main road with a blocked south entrance, whereas now the park consists of four small areas and four roads to separate the green areas.; In 1980, the park was a natural place with extensive grass and scattered trees, which represented the state of nature before the industrial revolution. Its development reflects the changes in social and environmental attitudes as well as changes in public recreation. The improvised paths and few benches showed a desire to emphasize nature rather than comfort, and few structures, such as a few benches and a small playground, showed a preference for nature over the usual amenities. The open space attracted visitors seeking simplicity and tranquility. Adding paved paths made the park more accessible to pedestrians and cyclists and showed the intention of accommodating a wider range of visitors. In contrast, the park today is a well-organized, multi-purpose place of recreation. The presence of more landscape features such as flowers and trees gives a more colorful, pleasant impression. The development of the park is a reflection of changes in the expectations of visitors, especially families and local residents, who want to see more amenities and recreation areas. This change not only serves the recreation needs of a new society but also reflects the desire to improve urban green spaces for community and environmental benefits. In short, the evolution of the park from the 1980s to the present shows how it has changed from a natural place to a multi-purpose recreation area.
654;The pie chart gives information on UAE government spending in 2000. The total budget was AED 315 billion.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The pie chart provides data about UAE regime expenditures in ten different sectors namely:law&order,Education,Industry agriculture &employment,Defence,other expenditure,Debt interest,housing the heritage& environment,Social security,Transport,and health&personal social services.while the total budget was AED315 billion for year 2000.In general, the visual indicates that most money went for social security,in contrast to transport that costs least expense on the UAE government from the total budget.To start with,the UAE government provided AED 315 billion as total budget for year 2000. The lion shear was for social security to record the highest value of expenses at AED 100 billion on the UAE government,followed by health and personal social services that AED 53 billion was spent by UAE authorities.Meanwhile, education costs was AED 38 billion from the total budget of year 2000.Interestingly,UAE government spent on other expenditure and debt interest only AED 23 billion for each from 2000's total budget.Later, defence ,Law and order,and housing the heritage and environment AED22 billion,AED17 billion,and AED 15 billion went for each respectively.Finally, the two least value was AED 13 billion,and AED 9 billion from the total budget to be paid for Industry agriculture &employment ,and transport accordingly.; This shows that the main items of expenditure were on education and health, and they accounted for AED 119 billion, or 38% of the total budget. After social services, the next largest item was economic services, which accounted for 29% of the total budget, or AED 91 billion. This category is likely to include spending on construction, roads, and other public works which are necessary for the rapid growth of the country. This significant investment reflects the government’s commitment to enhancing the quality of life for its citizens, with the emphasis on education, health and community services. In contrast, security and justice received 13% of the budget, or AED 41 billion, showing that although it is important, it does not get as much money as education and health. Other categories of expenditure received relatively small amounts, such as recreation, culture, and religion, which accounted for about 11% of the budget, or AED 35 billion, and housing and community services, which accounted for about 9%, or AED 29 billion. These categories are likely to include spending on areas such as hospitals, public works, and the environment. The distribution of government expenditure in the UAE in 2000 reflects the government’s emphasis on education and health, and the commitment to enhance the quality of life for its citizens while also fostering economic development.
1278;The pie charts below give data on the spending and consumption of resources by countries of the world and how the population is distributed.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;Following three pie chats depict the distribution of population globally compared to spending and consumption of resources by countries .Overall , we can obseve in the first figure that world spends more in food and transport .Whilst in second chart summerize population in the world with Asia has bigger share .However third figure notes that USA and Europe consume main resources of the world .By analysing following data , its evident that food have the bigger share of spending money including 24% of total spending . Whilst transport comes next including 18% , housing and cloths consume 12% and 6% respectively . Nevertheless other aspects of life consume 40% . Meanwhile second pie chart about world population . Although, Asia froms 57% of population , highest percentage , Europe and America form 28% distributed equally and Africa 10 % . Interestingly USA and Europe consume 60% of world resources and rest of the world consumes 40% . Clearly that USA and Europe constitue 28% of world population but they consume the main resources of the world.;" In this case, the proportion of resources used by developed countries is disproportionate to their population size. These pie charts illustrate the differences in both the consumption of resources and the distribution of population. By contrast, developing countries represent the majority of the world’s population and, while they account for approximately eighty per cent of the population, they use only thirty per cent of the resources. For example, developed countries, such as the United States, use almost seventy per cent of the total resources available, although they only contain 20 per cent of the world’s population. The result is a stark contrast and an illustration of the disproportionate share taken by wealthy countries of the world’s resources. Notably, the countries of Africa and Asia account for a large proportion of the developing world’s population, which suggests that these regions may in the future need to manage their resources more effectively, as they develop economically. These figures illustrate the economic disparity between the wealthier countries and those that struggle to meet the needs of their growing populations. In the end, these figures illustrate the inequalities in both the consumption of resources and the distribution of population, which demonstrate the need for a more equitable approach to sustainable development, so that all countries can meet their essential needs while preserving the environment. The disproportionate share of wealthier countries is not only a reflection of their higher standard of living; it also indicates a greater impact on the environment, which could lead to further problems."
546;The pie charts below show how dangerous waste products are dealt with in three countries.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;"The pie charts illustrate the dealing with dangerous waste products in the Republic of Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. It can be clearly seen that the last country is the only one where people do not use the recycling method; instead, they prefer chemical treatment and dumping at sea.According to the data, the underground method (82%) coloured in red in the United Kingdom pie chart prevails, compared to Sweden (55%) and the Republic of Korea (22%), coloured in green. On the other hand, people in the Republic of Korea prefer to use the recycling method 69%) the most, while those who live in Sweden do not use it so often (25%).The United Kingdom has identical points at 8% for chemical treatment and dumping at sea methods. However, the lowest point (2%) has the incineration method in this country, while people in the Republic of Korea and Sweden destroy waste by fire more often, 9% and 20%, respectively."; In country A, the main way of dealing with waste is by re-use, which is responsible for half of the waste management. This reflects a high priority on the circular economy and sustainable development. .. Analyzing these charts shows that there are great differences in waste management strategies in these countries. Landfilling is the main waste management method in country B, which has the highest percentage of all methods used. Incineration accounts for another 30%, only 10% is deposited in dumps, and the remaining 10% is dealt with in some other way. The relatively small amount of deposited waste in the dumps suggests that this country's waste management system is effective in reducing the long-term impact on the environment. The low percentage of incineration reflects a low priority on energy recovery from waste. In the case of country C, land filling is the main method, and it takes up 50% of the waste management, which reflects a great emphasis on traditional waste disposal methods and a high risk of soil and groundwater contamination. On the other hand, the use of re-use accounts for only 20% of the waste management, indicating the possibility of improvement. Incineration takes up another 35%, which reflects a moderate emphasis on the reduction of waste and the recovery of energy. . The chart above shows that there are different priorities in the waste management of these three countries. Country A is the leading country in terms of re-use and low use of dumps, while countries B and C should rethink their strategy to promote sustainable development.
596;The pie charts below show the average household expenditures in a country in 1950 and 2010.;The provided pie chart illustrates information about the spending rates in homes on different type of serevices in 6 dacades from 1950 to 2010.Overall,as it can be clearly seen that the housing expenditures rates is the highest in 1950 where,the health care rates was the least in that particular year.Where as in the 2010 the most expenditure was on food and the least expenditures was the transportation.As persented in the pie chart,the the majority of the people spend most of their money on housing with aprroximately 72.1percent that number dramaticly decreaced in 2010 to 22.0 percent .In contrast with the food sector where it started with only 11,2 percent in 1950 and rose up by almost 20% reaching to its peak od 34.0% in 2010.In terms, of other sectors including health care and education. the propotion of spending in the health care sector was relaetivly smaller with only 2.4 percent that number was doubled to 4.5.% in 2010.although there was no noticable changes in the education sector.Finally,the most significant change was definitely in transportation since people back in the 1950s where not interested in buying cars the percentage was as little as 3.3 percent that number dramaticky rose up to 14.0% in 2010.while their was obvious changes in other serevices the spending rates grow from 4.4% in 1950 to remarkable jump to 19.2 percent in the year 2010.; In 1950, the largest part of the household budget went to food, 34% of the total expenditure. A comparison of the two charts reveals considerable changes in the composition of household expenditures in the sixty-year period. The next most important category was clothing, 7%, and health, 10%, whereas the entertainment budget was relatively small, 6%, and the transport budget, 7%. This clearly shows that households then were prioritizing basic needs. Then 22% of the budget went to housing, which showed the importance of a solid foundation for the family. However, the housing category remained significant at 22%, showing consistency of importance. In 2010, the household budget showed a significant change in the composition of expenditures. The most important change was a decrease in food expenditures to 14%, which suggests a higher level of disposable income and a more diversified expenditure. By contrast, the transport budget increased to 15%, probably due to the increased ownership of cars and the opportunity to travel. Also, there were significant increases in the expenditure on health, which increased to 10%, probably due to an increase in medical care and the general increase in awareness of health problems. In short, the household budget showed that it was changing, which was in line with the economic development and changing priorities in the society over the sixty-year period.
678;The pie charts below show the percentage of housing owned and rented in the UK in 1991 and 2007.Summarize the information by describing the main features of the charts and making comparisons where appropriate.;The diagrams illustrate the proportions of four different kinds of housing in the UK between 1991 and 2007, namely home owner, social renting, private renting as well as social housing.Overall, it is clear that the number of homes in UK recorded a considerable increase from 1991 to 2007, at 22 million homes compared to 27 million homes. Furthermore, more UK residents owened their home while less people chose social renting and social housing during the period from 1991 to 2007.Looking into the details, ,home owner is the top choice for UK residents which comprised 60% in 1991. Then, it considerably rose to 70% after 16 years. Next came to the social renting which recorded an dramatic decrease from 1991 to 2007, at 23% and 17% in turn. The percentage of social housing also significantly plunged from 6% to 2%. The percentage of private renting remain unchanged at 11% over the period.; In 1991, the majority of housing was owned, with 66% of houses being occupied by the owner. The remaining 34% was made up of social and private rented housing. Then, in 2007, the number of private and social rented houses was almost the same as in 1991. However, the percentage of owner-occupied houses had fallen to 66%, while the number of houses rented out increased by 11%. This ownership structure reflects a stable housing market in which home ownership was seen as a sign of economic stability and its associated benefits. Interestingly, the percentage of social housing remained almost the same, indicating that, although the demand for private rental accommodation had increased, the availability of social housing remained fairly stable. The number of privately rented houses increased significantly, partly because the preferences of younger generations have changed in favour of mobility rather than the ties of home ownership. And the trend towards renting also reflects the growing acceptance of more diverse lifestyles and urban lifestyles as economic conditions have changed. In conclusion, a comparison of the two charts shows a shift in the UK housing market from a strong preference for owner-occupied housing towards a more balanced structure in which rental accommodation is more popular. This shift in the percentages shows wider socio-economic changes, such as changes in the population structure, changes in economic conditions and changing attitudes to home ownership and renting.
24;The pie charts below show the percentage of time working adults spent on different activities in a particular country in 1958 and 2008. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevantYou should write at least 150 words.;The pie charts indicate how the proportion of time changes in spending on different activities from working adults in a country in the years 1958 and 2008.Overall, while it can be seen that working was the most important event occupied a majority of the percentage of time either 1958 or 2008, the amount of time on sleeping decreased obviously in 2008.First, most of the researched events occupied more time than in the past. Working is one of the events presenting the most serious situation and it took 33% in 1958, increasing to 42% in 2008. Moreover, adult workers in this country were more likely to travel to work, presenting 8% in 2008 from only 2% in 1958. Besides working, citizens tended to relax at home spending 13% of the time on this event, and in which people take 8% of their time in 1958.However, the harder working, the less time was spent in rest. Working adults spent 25% of sleep in 2008, while they spent 32% in 1958. Also, they reduce the time spending in going out with their friends or families, spending only 6% in 1958 from 19% in 1958.; In 1958 the work took the biggest part of the day, with 42% of the activities. A comparison of the two years shows significant changes in the way adults spend their time, which indicates changes in lifestyle and social norms. Notably, only 15% of the day was available for rest and relaxation. Only 8% of the day was spent on sleep, which resulted in a culture of scarce rest. Closely followed by 30% were activities related to household chores. Probably because of the technological advances, changes in the roles of women at home and in the workforce have occurred. The most important changes in this respect can be seen in the year 2008: the time spent on work was reduced to 34%, which demonstrates a change towards a more balanced work-life balance. The proportion of sleep increased to 23%, which reflects the social appreciation of rest and well-being. Leisure time rose to 25%, which shows that recreation and rest have a higher priority for people in the year 2008 than in the year 1958. This change suggests that over the fifty-year period a more balanced life style was established. In conclusion, the pie charts show that from the year 1958 the time spent on work and household chores has decreased and the percentages of sleep and rest have increased.
744;The pie graphs show the nutritional consistency of two dinners. Write a report to a university lecturer describing the data.You should write at least 150 words.;The pie charts illustrate the percentage of different types of nutrients (carbohydrates, protein, glucose, saturated fat and others) presented in a medium baked potato and in a macaroni.Overall, it can be observed that carbohydrates have the highest proportion in both types of dinner. In addition, saturated fat has the lowest percentage in medium baked potato, while it is the nutrient with the second higher quantity in macaroni.Looking at the amount of carbohydrates, it is possible to see that medium baked potato has 35%, while in macaroni it can be found at 52%. In a medium baked potato the amount of protein is more than a double than in a macaroni, at 25% and 11% respectively. In addition, glucose has a slight difference, at 15% in the potato and 11% in macaroni.Regarding saturated fat, only one out of ten is presented in the potato, although this number is much high in macaroni, at 21%. Finally, considering other types of nutrients, its varies considerably, at 15% in the potato and only 5% in the macaroni.; Of the two meals, the one represented by the two pie graphs, the one in the figure shows that it is mostly composed of carbohydrates, which are half of the meal. If the data is analyzed, a clear picture of the nutritional value of each meal is created. The meal with a high percentage of this macronutrient, which is necessary for muscle building, contains 30% of the necessary macronutrients, whereas only 20% of fats are contained in the meal, which is lower than the desired amount, but still sufficient to provide the body with fatty acids. The meal in the figure is quite different from the other, because it contains only thirty percent of carbohydrates, which means that the energy value of this macronutrient is much lower. The percentage of the second macronutrient is much higher than in the first meal, which is why people who need to build or control their weight would be pleased to eat this meal. The percentage of fats in the meal is even higher than in the first meal, and they make up thirty percent of the meal. It is interesting that the meal B is richer in fats than the meal A, which can be attributed to the fat content of the meal being higher than in the first meal. This clearly shows the diversity of the consistency of these two meals and the resulting health benefits. Depending on the individual goals of people, they will prefer one of the two dinners, depending on the macronutrients that their bodies need.
152;The plans below show a student accommodation buildings 2010 and now.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant;The maps illustrate the changes of an architecture which was used for students’ accommodation in the year 2010 and now.In 2010, apparently, there was one main entrance in the southwest corner of the building where students could easily access. The livingroom was situated on the north side of the architecture where students could have a rest. Opposite to the livingroom, there was a bath room on the centre of the floor where students could use to take a shower. A kitchen was established be adjacent to the bathroom in the east side of the plan where children could cook by themselves. It is noticeable that there are three student-bedrooms laying on the southeast, northeast and northwest corners of the building respectively. Besides, the architecture was surrounded by gardens in the north and south sides.Now, after the modifications, an extra en-suits room has been added in the southeast corner be in the adjoining place of one of the student-bedrooms, taking the place of the hallway in 2010. It is worth noticing that the kitchen is also be used as a social area now. More striking is that the livingroom has been reconstructed into a student-bedroom. It must be pointed out that the building has been expanded and a new student-bedroom has been situated on the northwest corner of the architecture. In addition, the garden which was located on the south side of the construction has been modified into a car parking where individuals can park their cars.In conclusion, now the number of student-bedrooms has increased and the function of the student accommodation building has become manifold; For example, a building with a conventional layout was shown in the plan on the left, where there were several rooms on each floor and the occupants shared a common bathroom. Compared with this, the current building is much more complex. The entrance was centrally located, leading directly to the small entrance hall and the stairs connecting all floors. The design of the building was designed to emphasize privacy and limited community areas, which reflected the general life of students at that time. The biggest change is the number of shared spaces. The building has a large living room and study room on each floor, promoting collaboration and communication between students. The ground floor has a gym, in response to the growing need for health and well-being among students. The number of rooms on each floor has been reduced, and the en suite bathroom provides greater privacy and convenience. The design of the student rooms has also been improved. This reflects the trend of current students to seek a balance between social life and privacy. The kitchen has also been improved, and there is a kitchen on each floor. In addition, the entrance has been expanded, with a larger reception area and the most advanced security features.
998;The plans below show a student room for two people and a student room for one person at an Australian university.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The layout illustrates the structure of student rooms for one and two people respectively in an university in Australia.Overall, It can be obeserved that cost for one person in a double occupancy room is lower than expense in single room. the plan compares the amenities in both the rooms.Firstly the cost of one person is dollar 175/week in double room as compare to dollar 200 in single occupancy. The double occupancy room seems more cost effective and euipped with shared amenities.There is an evident difference in the size and facilities in both the room. The remarkable differences is table and chair.which are missing in the single room. Double occuapncy room comes additional cupboard and bookshelf as well. The width of the room is 4 meters and bigger as compare to single room which is 2.5 meters in dimesnions. Kitchen facilities are mostly similar in both the rooms.;" The shared student room, which is meant for two students, has a compact layout that is oriented toward community living. Both layouts offer the essential amenities, but differ significantly in terms of space usage and privacy. The shared room contains two beds, placed one beside the other, defining a central passage that makes the room easy to navigate. Each bed has a bedside table and a lamp, indicating the emphasis on individual comfort within a shared environment. The single-person room is designed with an emphasis on individual comfort and privacy. It has a larger sleeping area with a single bed, a personal study desk and plenty of storage space for personal belongings. There is a shared bathroom, which makes efficient use of space but is potentially less private due to the number of residents. This layout not only allows for a greater sense of privacy but also offers a quieter environment, which might enhance concentration and personal study time. In conclusion, both of these layouts have their advantages: the shared room fosters community but lacks privacy; the single-person room provides the necessary comforts, including a private bathroom. The choice between these two layouts will depend on the individual’s lifestyle, personal preferences and needs for privacy or community."
560;The process below shows how to make dough for a pizza.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;In the diagram, the steps needed to obtain a dough for a pizza are shown, figures are given for grams and time required for the process.In the initial stage, the staple ingredients, namely, 4 coup of 00 flour, 325 gr of water ( roughly one and a half cups) and a half teaspoon of dry active yeast respectively, are blended together in a cup.After being placed in a stand mixer, the primordial dough undergo through 3 mixing stages, with the first and the third at slow speed for 2 minutes each, and the second at medium speed for 5 minutes.Subsequently, the dough is going to be left to rest as long as its thickness has increased twofold, which it would takes at least 2 Hours.Having gotten rid of the bubbles by squeezing them manually, the resulting portion of dough is either divided thoroughly into 3 slices equally sized or making each of the three parts weigh 275 grams.; The following process is quite simple, but is an essential part of making a delicious pizza. There are five key steps in the process. The ingredients are: flour, water, yeast, salt and olive oil. The flour is used to give the dough its structure and the water activates the yeast which is vital for fermentation. The salt strengthens the gluten, giving the dough its elasticity. The yeast is added to ensure that the mixture is not too dry. The olive oil adds moisture and flavour. This combination is crucial for the hydration of the flour and the development of the gluten. The flour and salt are gradually added to the water, which has been dissolved in it, to form a thick paste. This paste is then kneaded for about ten minutes. This step is essential as it ensures the development of the gluten, giving the dough its chewy texture. Once the kneading has been completed, the dough is left to rest and rise for about an hour. This is done in a warm place, as the yeast begins to produce the carbon dioxide which causes the dough to rise. Compared to other breads, the rising time is often shorter and the dough is less well hydrated, giving the finished product a denser, chewier texture. Finally, once the dough has doubled in size, it is ready to be shaped. This shaping can be done by hand or by using a rolling pin, depending on the thickness of the crust that is desired. Each of these steps contributes to the finished product, which is essential for the success of the whole dish. In conclusion, making a good pizza requires a simple but precise process which combines the right ingredients, the right mixture, kneading and rising times.
1372;The proportion of older people is increasing, what problems will this cause and what solutions can be suggested?;In many countries the proportion of older people is steadily increasing. What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.It is true that nowadays people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences to this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.As people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. In other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. A second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. Finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent vital healthcare, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of senior citizens.In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.This essay covers the task requirements, however some problems of aging population get only a brief mention. The linking of sentences in the second body paragraph is somewhat ‘mechanical’ and could have been improved. Information sequencing and organisation in paragraphs are done well. The range of vocabulary and the fluency of its use, as well as lack of errors are impressive. Overall, this is a good example of how to get Band 8 without writing a very long essay.; Life expectancy continues to increase due to advances in medicine and better living conditions, which means that the increasing proportion of older people in society should be critically analyzed and solved. One of the major problems with an aging population is the burden it places on health care. The economy is also significantly affected by an increasing proportion of elderly people. The care of older people who often need more health care and more chronic disease care leads to an increased demand for health care professionals and material. This in turn leads to increased waiting times, reduced access to health care and increased health care costs for both individuals and governments. In many countries it will be difficult for governments to set aside enough funds for pensions and care for the elderly, and the younger generations will be put under great financial pressure. To cope with these challenges, there are several solutions that can be used. Firstly, it can be alleviated by promoting an active aging with policies that make it possible for older people to stay in the labor market longer, by facilitating flexible work hours, by retraining and by tax incentives for companies to hire older people. Secondly, preventive health care and health care in the community can relieve health care systems. Thirdly, intergenerational cooperation can strengthen social cohesion and share knowledge, perspectives and resources between the generations. - Regular examinations, health education and healthy lifestyles can help reduce the onset of chronic diseases.
1242;The table below describes the number of employees and factories in England and Wales from 1851 to 1901.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The table below shows the total number of employees,including male and female employees, and factories in England and Wales throught out the 60 year period from 1851 to 1901.Overall, it can be clearly seen that the total numbers of people employed had decreased over the period, whereas the number of factories had increased and only went down in the last 20 years.The number of male employees had a significant drop in the first decade,losing more than half the number of employees in 1851 and gradually decline overtime.Additionally,Female employees had a major in incline in the second decade which is exactly 100 thousands employees and countinued to decrease like male employees.As a result, the total number of employees declined noticeably in the first 20 years and steadliy went down for the next 40 years.In contrary,the number of factories increased considerably,reaching 721 factories in 1881 then slowly went downward afterwards.; In 1851, there were 1,709,200 employees in 226,100 factories in England and Wales. By 1861, the number of employees rose slightly to 1,878,000 and the number of factories rose slightly to 231,000. And it continued to rise by 1881, with 2,654,000 employees and 241,000 factories. In the next two decades there were large fluctuations. It is likely that there was a change in the method of manufacture. While the number of employees continued to increase, reaching 3,171,000 in 1901, the number of factories fell sharply, falling to 183,100. In conclusion, the period from 1851 to 1901 in England and Wales was characterized by a strong increase in the number of employees in the factories, which is a reflection of the momentum of the industrial revolution. At the same time, the number of factories is likely to increase in size and productivity, so that more workers are employed in fewer factories.
292;The table below gives information about the population of New Zealand between 2011 and 2012.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and making comparisons where relevant.;The table details the number of people living in New Zealand changed from2011 to 2012 and divided those people into four age groups.Looking from an overall perspective, the number of all ages was increasing. However, the percentage change in those four devided age groups was not as same as the all ages, to the contrary, two of these groups just showed opposite trend.In terms of all ages, the number in 2012 was 4,460,000, compared to the number in 2011, the percentage change increased 0,6 , which was as same as the percentage change of the 40-64 age group. Besides, we can easily see that the change in 65+ group was the most significant one, with the figure in 2011 500,000, increased 400,000, approximately double in the following year.As for the two decending age groups, under 15 and 15-39, the percentage change were both -0,2 , although the specific numbers were different. The age under 15 amounted to 801,750, was merely declined 1,750 in 2012, at the same time, the number of 15-39 group was largely decreased, changed from 1,520,000 to 1.500,000 in 2012.; In 2011, the population of New Zealand was about 4.3 million people. The table shows the population of New Zealand for two years and reveals changes in the distribution of the population across the age groups. The table also shows the level of population growth and decline in these two years. Interestingly, the percentage of people aged 60 and over was significantly lower, about 14%. The largest age group was people aged 15-29, with about 20% of the population, and the next most numerous was those aged 30-44, with about 19%. The most noticeable change occurred in the age distribution towards the oldest group: the percentage of people over 60 rose to 16%, indicating a gradual aging of the population. By the end of 2012, the population increased to about 4.5 million, and the percentage of people over 60 rose to 17%, which suggests a gradual increase in the population. Another comparison is the balance of young and old people. The percentage of people aged 15-29 and 30-44 fell slightly to 19% and 18% respectively. This may indicate that the population of young people is not growing as quickly as the population of older people. The data indicate that the population is steadily aging, which may be a reflection of changing societal structures. The increase in the older population is a reflection of New Zealand's trend towards longer life and higher life expectancy, while the slight decline in the young population can be attributed to migration and changes in birth rates.
1206;The table below gives information about the underground railway systems in six cities.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The given table provides dataset on subway systems in 6 different cities in 3 different cities in 3 distinctive continents. The figures are displayed in terms of inauguration date, the length of route, in kilometers, and number of passengers in millions.Overall, the table outlines that older systems also are longer in extension and have more passengers.London, Paris and Tokyo were opened before the first half of the twentieth century (1863, 1900 and 1927 respectively). The former has the longest route (394 km) and latter the shortest (155 km); on the other hand the Japanese city has almost three times more passengers than the English capital.The cities with younger systems, namely Washington DC, Kyoto and Los Angeles were all opened after 1970. The North American cities have respectively 126 km and 28 km; while the Asian city accounts for 11 km. The capital of the US has the highest number of passengers (144 million) and the Asian city, the shortest, 45 million."; The table shows information about six cities, London, Paris, New York, Tokyo, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. London is the oldest underground railway, opened in 1863. In length, Tokyo is much longer than other underground systems, with 368 kilometers. Los Angeles, on the other hand, is the newest. The difference in age between these two is a reflection of the difference in the stage of urban development and public transport. Paris and Tokyo have the highest annual use figures, respectively, of 1,189 million and 3,927 million passengers. This reflects their widespread use and the way in which they are integrated into daily life. London comes second with 402 kilometers, while Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles have the shortest lines, respectively, 126 and 28 kilometers. In the end, it is clear that Tokyo and Paris have established very long underground railway systems and are heavily used, while Los Angeles has the shortest. Despite its relatively long length, London carries 1,350 million passengers annually, indicating the competitivity of urban transport in these cities. Washington D.C. and Los Angeles have the shortest line and the lowest passenger number, respectively, 144 million and 50 million. This may reflect the fact that the car is more popular than public transport, or that the system is not so connected to other cities in the world. The data shows that urban rail transport plays a vital role in the public transport of these cities.
380;The table below shows population figures for four countries for 2003 and projected figure for 2025 and 2050.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The table indicates the population of four countries in 2003, as well as the predicted data for the years 2025 and 2050.Overall, Indonesia was the country having the largest population and is projected to increase in future. In contrast, the population in Italy is foreseen to be lower in the future than in the previous data.First, there were 238 million in the population in Indonesia. it is not only that the number of Indonesian was the highest value in 2003, but also is predicted to have an obvious rise to 274 million in 2025 and 312 million in 2050. Regarding Argentina, the number of people in this country was recorded as 34 million in 2003 and has a bulge to be an almost double figure in 2050, presenting 62 million. the population in the Republic of Korea is forecasted to increase to 52 million in 2025 and remain stable until 2050, with 48 million recorded in 2003.However, Italy is the only country predicted to be declining in population in this table. there were 54 million Italian in 2003 and this will be decreasing to 47 million in 2025. The downtrend will be kept there will be 45 million Italian in 2050.; Country A had a population of 50 million in 2003. Country B, which is smaller than it, had a population of 30 million. The population figures for Country C in 2003 were 20 million and the lowest figure was 10 million for Country D. All four countries are projected to have significantly higher populations in 2025, with Country A projected to have 60 million people and Country B 45 million. The figures for Country C are expected to be around 30 million and those for Country D are expected to be around 20 million. By 2050, Country A’s population is expected to be stable at 70 million, and Country B is projected to have a slightly lower population, of 44 million. Country C is projected to show a steady rise to 35 million, and Country D a steady rise to 30 million, which suggests a rapid increase in urbanization or in the number of immigrants. This table shows the wide range of population trends and future challenges for each country. In conclusion, the population figures show that Country A is likely to have a population that is no longer increasing, while Country C and D, which started with lower figures, are both expected to have much higher populations. Country B’s population may have risen but may be expected to fall.
1228;The table below shows social and economic indicators for four countries in 1994, according to United Nations statistics.Describe the information shown below in your own words. What implications do the indicators have for the countries?;The table compares the performance of social and economic aspects for Canada, Japan, Peru and Zaire in 1995. In general, Japan and Canada outperformed in four social and economic indicators their counterparts, Peru and Zaire.To be precise, regarding the economic indicators, people in Japan earned the highest annual income among the four countries, with US$ 15,760, and Canadian people earned the second most annual income with US$11,100. People in Peru and Zaire earned a lower annual income, almost 98 times less than people in Canada and Japan.With regard to the social indicators, people in Canada and Japan showed a longer life expectancy at birth, both of which had a life expectancy of more than 75 years old, whereas the life expectancy in Peru and Zaire was much lower, with only around 50 years old. The adult literacy rate in Canada and Japan saw the same percentage, both at 99%. While 68% of adults in Peru had literacy, the adult literacy rate in Zaire was only 34%, two times less than Peru and almost three times lower than Canada and Japan. With respect to the daily calorie supply, Canada had the highest calorie supply per person, with a number of 3326, while Japan, Peru, and Zaire received a lower calorie supply with aroud 2000 only.; When examining the differences in per capita income between the countries, the disparity is clearly visible. Looking at life expectancy and literacy, it can be seen that there is a wide difference in the life and living conditions of the population. Life expectancy is another indicator of the state of health in each country. Higher per capita income suggests greater wealth and productivity and a greater likelihood of spending on health, education and social security. The literacy rate adds further information on social development. Higher life expectancy is associated with better public health, standards of hygiene and living conditions. However, countries with low literacy rates have fewer opportunities for education, employment and development. A high level of literacy suggests a well-educated workforce and, by implication, a more prosperous and capable population. These disparities between countries and between their citizens need to be addressed if social and economic development is to be achieved.
344;The table below shows the consumption of three basic foods (wheat, maize, rice) by people in four different countries.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;THe given chart illustrates the comsuption of three basic foods(wheat, maize, rice) by people in four different countries which are Cambodia, Poland, Egypt and mexico. The measurement used per basic food is calories per person per day.If we analyse rice consumption first, we can observe that Cambodia leads the consumption rate, followed by far by Egypt, Mexico and Poland. However over wheat the country with highest consumption rate is Egypt closely followed by Poland. Regarding maize the country with a higher consumption rate is Mexico, followed by Egypt, nevertheless the maize consumption in Mexico almost doubles Egipt´s consumption.To summarise the consumption of rice in Cambodia is almost 300% over the rice consumption in Egypt, and very far away from the consumption in Mexico and Poland. The wheat consumption in Egypt is high, and is over a 30% beyond Poland´s consumption. To finalize the consumption of maize is high in Mexico being almost 100% over Egypt´s consumption.; It is clear from the table that rice is the most popular staple food in Country A and Country B. Country A consumes an impressive 200 kilograms of rice per capita per year, which clearly demonstrates its preference for rice as a major source of carbohydrates. This emphasises the importance of rice in the diets of these two countries. In contrast, Country C and Country D depend on maize and wheat in their diets. Country D eats the most wheat of all the countries, at a rate of 200 kilograms per person, and is clearly influenced by the agricultural conditions of the area. Country C eats the greatest quantity of maize at 150 kilograms per person, which suggests that this country is heavily dependent on this staple food, perhaps because of the favourable climate. However, wheat consumption in Country C is relatively low, at only 50 kilograms per person, which suggests that maize provides the main source of energy for the population. Country D consumes the least maize at only 30 kilograms per person, which highlights a clear preference for wheat. Wheat may be an important staple food in this country, perhaps due to the culture and traditions of baking. These dietary habits may also be influenced by local conditions, both geographical and climatic. Country A and B are heavily influenced by rice, while Country C and D are influenced by maize and wheat.
264;The table below shows the percentage of adults in urban and rural areas who took part in four free time activities in 1990 and 2010. Summarize the information and compare where relevant, by selecting and reporting the key features.You should write at least 150 words.;The chart illustrated the rate of adults in urban and rural areas, who participated in four free time activities at two time 1990 and 2010.First of all, we can see that reading and photography activities increased in 2010 in both territory and it was the favorite activity. The last thirds activities are less popular but knowned some small change.On one hand, 61% of people read in urban area in 1990 compare to 71% in rural and these percentages rose up to 78% for both areas in 2010. Photography knowned a similar change from 7% and 14% to reach a peak at 17% and 24%, in urban and rural areas respectively.On the other hand, percentage of animated play dropped out from 18% to 14% in countries and remain the same in urban areas. Conversely, playing went down in urban from 21% to 14% in 2010 and didn't change in rural areas with 26%.To conclude, reading stay away the favorite activity for people in each areas trought the years. People seemed to be more interested in photography. Animated play and playing remain the same with a little decreased in rural for animated and urban for playing.; In urban areas, the percentage of adults who read fell from 65% in 1990 to 50% in 2010. These four activities were reading, gardening, sports and attending cultural events. Meanwhile, the percentage of those who took part in cultural events increased slightly from 15 in 1990 to 18 in 2010. On the other hand, the percentage of people who took part in gardening rose from 20 to 35, which indicates that people in cities are becoming more interested in gardening. In rural areas, reading still occupied a large number of people, the percentage of those who read was still high, and the percentage of people who read rose from 10 to 14 from the same year. A lot of people were involved in gardening, showing that people in rural areas are becoming more interested in gardening. However, the percentage of people who played sports fell slightly from 40 to 35, and the percentage of people who attended cultural events also fell from 30 to 25. In general, the percentage of people who participate in gardening in both urban and rural areas is higher, which is related to the development of leisure and the characteristics of the country's population.
88;The table below shows the production of milk annually in four countries in 1990. 2000 and 2010. Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The table is presenting that amount in litres of milk production at these four diffrent coutries in specific three each year during 20 years term.Netherlands and Australia are producing significantly big number of litres milk, compare with those other countries. In 1990, Netherland and Australia is almost same amout of milk production was done, then in 2000, Australia is slightly less than Netherland which is 50000 difference. In 2010, those two countries have big differencies of number of litres wich is more than 2 milion litres.Other two countries are much less production than First two countires. Nevertherless, Tanzania is still the one of the big producer of milk which is third place of this table.Guatemala is small producer, but those 20 years, production is much increase which is 60000; You can write about four countries: Country A, Country B, Country C and Country D. In the year 90, country A produced the most milk, 150 million liters, and country B, country C and country D each produced much less, 80, 70 and 60 million respectively. In the ten years between the years 90 and 2000, country A's production increased by 33 percent, from 150 million liters to 200 million liters. Country B also increased, this increased by 62,5 percent, resulting in a substantial increase in production. Country C increased slightly to 90 million liters, which is a relatively modest increase of 28%. But country D increased by 67,7%, resulting in a significant improvement in milk production. Interestingly, country D continued to increase, and its production had increased to 120 million liters. In the ten years between the years 2000 and 2010, country A still produced the most milk, 220 million liters, while country B increased to 140 million liters. Country C did not increase at all in the ten years between the years '90 and '10, its production had remained at 90 million liters. Country D increased to 150 million liters, which is a substantial increase. On the other hand, country C's lack of development makes one wonder about its production strategy and its ability to adapt to changing market conditions. In summary, while country A has remained the largest milk producer over the years, country B and country D have both made substantial improvements, resulting in a significant increase in milk production and thus becoming more competitive.
948;The table below shows the results of surveys in 2000, 2005 and 2010 about one university.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The table shows the ratings given to different aspects of a university and how these differ from 2000, 2005 and 2010.In 2000 the teaching quality was considered good by sixty-five percent of the student, while in 2005 sixty-three percent of them rated good this aspect. However, in 2010 the percentage raised to sixty-nine.In 2000 eighty-four percent of the student found the print resources a valid service. The percent increases to eighty-nine in 2005 and decreases to eight-eight in 2010.With regard to electronic resources, a huge difference between years can be spotted: in 2000 the percentage of students with a good rating for this aspect was forty-four, while it was seventy-two in 2005 and eighty-eight in 2010. This change shows a big jump in the percentage of students that rated good this service.Regarding the range of modules offered the percentage remained stable throughout the year. in 2000 thirty-two percent of the students considered good this aspect. In 2005 only thirty percent of the people asked stated that the service was good. The number was twenty-seven in 2010.With regard to the last aspect the number remained the same for all years: seventy-seven percent of the students gave a high score to this aspect.; In 2000, the students were largely satisfied with the academic quality of the university, indicating their contentment at a level of 75%. The next year, in 2005, satisfaction with the facilities and the whole academic experience at the university increased to a level of 80%. The academic experience was consistently viewed favourably throughout the decade. However, satisfaction with the facilities varied considerably. The percentage of those who were satisfied with the university's facilities and services reached a peak of 85% in 2005, but then began to decrease, ending up at 84% in 2010. Moreover, the overall satisfaction with the university varied over the period. In the year 2000, only 60% of the students expressed themselves favourably about the facilities and services. However, in 2005, this figure rose to 80%, indicating a significant improvement in the physical condition and amenities of the university. In the year 2010, the satisfaction figure fell slightly, ending up at 75%. Students were largely satisfied with the academic experience at the university, indicating this in a positive way with a figure of 70% in the year 2000. In the following year, this percentage rose to 88%, indicating a significant improvement in this aspect of the university's functioning. Nevertheless, in the year 2010, this figure fell to a level of 80%, perhaps indicating a certain disillusionment with the university due to a higher student population or a change in policy. This information demonstrates that the university is committed to raising its standards, but it must also maintain the standard of its facilities and amenities and ensure a consistent high level of satisfaction with its overall performance. In conclusion, there is an upward trend in the satisfaction of the students with the academic quality of the university, but satisfaction with the facilities and the whole experience of the university was more volatile.
892;The table below shows the salaries of secondary/high school teachers in 2009. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparison where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The table gives information about the salaries of secondary school teachers in different countries in 2009. The main differences between the countries are two. First, a discrepancy concerns the starting salary of teachers. Second, there is a gap in the years that teachers need to teach before obtaining the maximum salary.On the one hand, the starting salaries of teachers in the selected countries are slightly different. Luxemburg teachers reach the highest starting salary, equal to 80,000. Instead, in Australia, there are the least paid teachers, they have less than 30,000 per year. There is an enormous discrepancy between Luxemburg, in which the starting salaries are the highest ones, and the other countries. Although Denmark is the second country in giving higher salaries, the money teachers reach the first years of teaching is 45.000.On the other hand, another discrepancy concerns the years that a teacher has to teach before reaching the maximum salary. Indeed, despite being the least-paid teachers, Australians obtain the maximum salary after 9 years of teaching and obtain 48.000 per year. Instead, Luxemburg requires 30 years of work to give teachers the maximum salary, which is also the highest among the countries, and corresponds to 130.000. Denmark is the country in which high-school teachers obtain the maximum salary in just 8 years. On the completely opposite side, Japan teachers have to teach for at least 37 years before obtaining the highest salary.; This table shows the salaries of secondary school teachers in different countries in the year 2009. The table is made up of eight countries: Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, South Korea and the United Kingdom. It is clear from the table that the average salary in the United States is the highest, with an average salary of $ 56,000, and that this is much higher than the average salary in South Korea and the United Kingdom, which is about $ 46,000 and $ 45,000 respectively. The average salary in Japan and Germany is the lowest, which is $ 38,000 and $40,000 respectively. The average salary in Norway is $ 45,000 and is therefore in the middle between the highest salaries in the United States, Australia and South Korea, and the lowest salaries in Germany and Japan. The average salary in Australia is about $ 49,000, which means that the salary there is relatively high compared to the other countries. In short, the salaries of teachers in the eight countries varied greatly, but the United States came out as the most well-paid country, which illustrates the difference in educational budgets and the values of the public towards the teaching profession.
1212;The table below shows the sales at a small restaurant in a downtown business district.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The chart provides information on purchases at a mini restaurant in the week of october (7th -13th ).Overall, the sales were much more attributed to dinner consumption than lunch across all the days of the week , with a drop in sales by the weekend.There is an observable steady increase in lunch sales as we move across the week. Purchases worth $2400 was made on monday and a slight improvement on sales by $50 on tuesday and a further increase in sales to $2595 on Wednesday.There was however a dip in sales on thursday, with an immediate rebound increment on friday to exactly $2500.However, the sales dopped drastically to $1550 on Sunday.Regarding Dinner sales, we can see that a revenue of $3623 was realised on monday. Afterwards, the purchases became relatively stable at arround $3850 from tuesday to thursday and a further rise to $4350 on Friday. Similarly to lunch sales, there was also a drop by the weekend to about $2450.; It is clear from the data that the most popular dish in the restaurant is the hamburger. It has a consistent monthly percentage of more than thirty per cent. On the other hand, the sale of pizzas is quite high, but the sales are very irregular, peaking in March, and decreasing towards the end of the sales period. It suggests that although the pizza is a basic dish, it may also be a seasonal or special event that promotes higher sales at certain times. This indicates a strong preference for solid and traditional dishes that are in line with the needs of the office workers. Desserts are the least sold throughout the period, indicating a lower interest in sweets, perhaps due to the greater interest in the main course, which comes first for time-poor office workers. On the other hand, salads and desserts represent the smallest percentage of total sales. This may indicate a greater interest in healthy and healthy eating. The data can thus give the restaurant's management a very clear idea of the preferences of the public and enable them to make adjustments and promotions to meet these preferences. In summary, the data give a clear picture of the restaurant's preferences, with hamburgers based on the convenience and comfort of fast food, and salads and desserts behind. On the other hand, pasta is a fairly stable percentage and represents the middle ground between the most and least popular dishes.
1162;The table below shows the sales made by a coffee shop in an office building on a typical weekday.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The following table illustrate the sales made by a coffee shop in office building on an ideal weekday .Overall , drinks like Tea and Coffee have highest sales in the morning . Likewise , Pastries . However ,more Sandwiches have been sold afternoon .By having a close look at the figure , it is obviously showing that Coffee peaked in the morning with 265 . Whilst reduced slightly between 10:30 - 14:30 to 185 and contiune to fall in the evening . Afterward , sales rise to 200 after dinner meal . Likewise , Tea sales increased in the morning with 110 .While reduced afternoon and in the evening before getting higher at the night with 75 .Meanwhile , Pastries and Sandwiches sales are flucuated . whilst Pastries highset sales number in the morning with 275 , it dropped at night to 80 . Unlike Sandwiches which start at lowest number in the morning with 50 piece only .Nevertheless their sales increased dramatically afternoon to 200 and fall to 110 at the night .; The coffee sales table for one weekday in an office building gives the number of cups of coffee, cappuccino, tea, and sandwiches sold, and so indicates the habits of the office workers of the building. It is clear that the coffee that is sold in the greatest number of cups is espresso coffee, with a total of 120 cups. By contrast, the number of cups of cappuccino is only 95. This indicates the greater preference for a strong, quick drink in the office environment. It may be that the employees of the building are making their preference for espresso coffee. The number of cups of tea is relatively small, and tea is seen as a drink that combines health and speed. The number of sandwiches sold is only 70, showing a different but complementary trend. In short, the sales figures show a preference for espresso coffee, followed by cappuccino, with less tea and sandwich. It is clear that office workers have a strong need for coffee, especially espresso, as an energy drink, which also increases the vitality of the workers and strengthens the importance of the coffee shop as a caffeine bar. . Although there is a clear preference for coffee, sandwiches can be seen as an indispensable choice, which can be a lunch or a quick snack.
1168;The table below shows the table made by a coffee shop in an office building on a typical weekday.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The given table presents the detailed amounts of four products that are daily sold in a coffee shop located in an office building. These products include coffee, tea, pastries, and sandwiches. As is shown by the table the data is categorized into four periods on a typical weekday from 7:30 until 20:30.From the first row of the given diagram, it is clear that pastries and coffee are the favorite products during the first three hours of the day, with 275 and 265 units, respectively.The next period has the sandwiches as the most common product between 10:30 and 14:30, while coffee maintain its position at the second place with 185 sales.Turning to the afternoon, during which pastries again retain the dominance with 150 sales in the hours 14:30- 17:30, and coffee occupies again the second place with 145.At the end of the day, this coffee shop sees, for the first time, that coffee is the most bought item at a specific period of the day with 200 cups of coffee served for the clients, while sandwiches this time come second with 110.Turning to tea, which is apparently the least popular product in this place during most of the time apart from the morning hours. The tea sales stand at 110, 50, 35, and 75 in this chronological order.Overall, coffee is the most stable item during the day, as it occupies the first or the second places over the whole period given in this table.; It is clear from the table that the amount of coffee sold varies greatly. The table shows the daily sales of various coffees at a coffee shop located in an office building on a typical weekday. In terms of the amount of coffee sold, the most popular is coffee. A total of 180 cups of coffee were sold. This shows that the coffee-drinking population prefers strong coffee, which is probably because of the high caffeine content and the time spent on preparing it is more appealing to busy office workers. The sale of latte was 100 cups, which shows that it is not as popular as coffee and cappuccino. The creamy taste and richness of the cappuccino may attract those looking for a more luxurious option. The amount of coffee Americano sold was the lowest with only 70 cups sold. Americano is a popular option in many coffee shops, but the rich taste and sweet taste of latte may be an attraction for those who want to be sweeter and more sour. The coffee Americano is too simple and not as popular as other coffees, which means that it is a trend. Using this information, the coffee shop can manage inventory and marketing strategies to better serve the needs of the office worker population.
48;The table describes the changes of people who went for international travel in 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005. (million).Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The table compares the changes in the number of international travelers in different regions in the years of 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005.It is clear that the total number of international travelers increased in the given 15 year period. However, the increase was the most marked from 1990 to 1995.In the given statistics, Europeans are the ones who like to travel the most and the middle east is the place where least people went for trips internationally. While Africa and Asia and the Pacific experienced a similar increasing trend of travellers from 1995 to 2005.In America, people showed a great willingness to travel abroad between 1990 to 1995. But, then the number stayed more or less at the same level till 2005. Likewise, Europe also experienced a significant increase from 1990 to 2000 in travelling abroad. But, after 1995, there was an increase of around 10 million only.Overall, Europe contributed the most in overseas travel, whereas the Middle East had the least share of overseas travelers.; In 1990, there were 394 million people who went abroad. The general trend is that the international travel increased significantly from 1990 to 2005. The figures were increased year after year and in 1995 the figure was 575 million, an increase of 181 million, which was approximately 45.9% of the previous figure. In the next five years, the figure reached 737 million in 2000, which was a significant increase of 162 million. In 2005, the figure reached 842 million, a significant increase of 105 million over the previous year. The following trend is also noteworthy. The most of the international travelers are Europeans, and the figures are higher every year. In 1990, the European travelers were 217 million, accounting for 55.6% of the total. Travelers from Asia and the Pacific region are also increasing, but from a lower base, in 1990 only 53 million people traveled there. In 2005, the figure rose to 149 million, a significant increase. This is a sign of the trend of globalization, the development of transport, and the improvement of access to international tourist destinations.
836;The table displays the average monthly rainfall for the year in five cities of the world.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The following table gives information on the average monthly rainfall in five cities. In the first row of the table, every month of the year is shown, from January to December. In the first column of the table, five cities are visible; Hongkong,Tokyo,Jakarta,Cairo, and London. The following cities are from very different parts of the world, this why there is great differences between the values. The city with the least rainfall was Cairo, hence there was not any rain from September to December, while Hongkong and Jakarta have had significantly more rain throughout the year. Hongkong peaked at 380mm of rain in August, and experienced the greatest fluctiation in monthly rainfall, with the biggest difference between January and August. In Tokyo, there is a steady increase in monthly rainfall from January to December, with only slight deviations. Jakrata seen the most rain in January, with an outstanding 300mm, which decreases until August, then starts increasing again until December. London is the most consistent out of the 5 cities, with the biggest difference between months being 25mm of rain."; Each month of the year, the city of Nairobi is the city with the least rainfall, and it has a consistent pattern of about 50 to 100 mm. On average, only two months of the year, April and November, exceed 120 mm, and this is about 60 mm. Tokyo has the opposite pattern. The monthly average rainfall is high in the summer, peaking in June at over 200 mm, and then drops to around 100 mm in July and August. London has a more variable pattern of rainfall, but it is relatively stable, with monthly averages between 50 and 80 mm, the highest of which is in October, so it has a relatively stable but moderate rainy season. In New York, the pattern is more similar to Tokyo, but in July the monthly average rainfall is high, and it is only 80 mm, which is lower than the average monthly average of other months. However, the pattern of Sydney is the most distinct, and it is very clear that there is a large amount of rain in the summer, especially in December, January and February, exceeding 100 mm. This means that the rain is strong and mostly in late spring and summer, which is different from other cities. Tokyo and Sydney have obvious seasonal changes and large rainy seasons. These five cities have different climates.
788;The table displays trends concerning the amounts of fast food consumed in Melbourne. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevantYou should write at least 150 words.;The table outlines the past, present, and future consumption of five types of fast food. Comparing the consumption in 2005 with the present level, it is clear that all consumptios of fast food has increased since 2005 except for the hamburger. While this trend suggests that hamburger consumption is in decline, projected consumption in 2025 shows that burgers would gain renewed interest.Moving the attention away from hamburgers, we can see that the increase in salad consumption is more drastic than that of other fast food categories. Specifically, the predicted increase in fried chicken consumption is 10 units, which is outshadowed by the 36-unit increase for salad. This suggests that, while more fast food will be consumed overall, the general public is shifting towards healthier options.Finally, although the consumption for hamburger, friedn chicken, and salad all increased significantly, figures for fried rice and noodles remained stagnant. This suggests that both fried rice and noodles are less welcomed by the consumers compared to other fast food.; From the table it can be seen that hamburgers are the most popular fast food in Melbourne, always in the lead in terms of consumption rates over the period shown. The table reveals trends concerning the amounts of fast food consumed in Melbourne, displaying the preference for three types of fast food - hamburgers, fried chicken and pizza. But fried chicken is the most popular type of fast food, and it shows a steady upward trend. This may be due to the growing popularity of specialist fried chicken outlets, and the advent of gourmet fried chicken. However, the trend of declining sales of pizza is also reflected in the table, perhaps indicating changing tastes or a saturated market. The steady increase may indicate that consumers are seeking alternatives to hamburgers. The shifts in the figures are indicative of changing tastes in the city, influenced by the economy, lifestyle changes and the changing nature of the food market. Perhaps, the emergence of healthy eating habits or the emergence of new food trends have caused consumers to look for alternatives to fast food and hence contribute to the decline in popularity of fast food.
889;The tendency of news reports in the media to focus more on problems and emergencies rather than on positive developments is harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole.To what extent do you agree or disagree?;News reports in the media focus on problems and emergencies more often than on some positive events. Is it really harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole?Let us consider the purpose of the media existence first. I suppose it is to spread important information, so that people may use it in their lives. And problems are usually more important than some positive developments, since, in fact, they are the things which people should be aware of in the first place. For example, due to the COVID, which is an international problem, many people lost their jobs. If they had been notified about the rising of pandemic though, they would have prepared somehow (save more money by cutting unnecessary expenses, learn a new profession and so forth).Moreover, I believe problems shall be solved. And when people are concerned about some problems, they may tend to face them with honor and participate in solving them. For instance, the energy crisis is a huge problem, and it is important to aware society of it, so that individuals could try to be more careful with gas and electricity. In the end, society will benefit from it, so it is not harmful.On the other hand, there is some negative impact of bad news on individuals sometimes. But I am sure it should be considered as psychological issues of particular individuals, rather than a problem of today's media system. People just should not fall in despair because of news reports, but think how they could take an advantage of the provided information to minimize a negative impact and help humanity to solve problems.Finally, in my view, the stated tendency is not really harmful to society, but it may sometimes be harmful to the individuals, and they are responsible for it.; It is the role of the media to create and shape public opinion and public awareness. However, the media have a growing tendency to focus on problems, emergencies and negative events rather than on positive developments. This imbalance is harmful to both individuals and the society as a whole. This one-sided presentation of the negative creates a bias in public perception and makes people think the world is more dangerous and troubled than it actually is. This is harmful for several reasons. First, the constant presentation of negative news creates a sense of fear and anxiety in people. Second, the tendency to focus on problems can actually overshadow the positive developments and innovations that are equally important for the public debate, such as the important developments in health, technology and social justice. Research suggests that the constant exposure to negative news and the anxiety that it causes can lead to depression and anxiety disorders. But it is also important to realize that the presentation of problems is necessary for public awareness and accountability. When positive developments are underrepresented, there is less opportunity to celebrate and build on them. In the end, although it is important for the media to report on problems and emergencies in order to inform the public, an overemphasis on the negative has a harmful effect on both individuals and society. The balance between presenting problems and acknowledging achievements is a challenge. The result of a more balanced presentation can be a more positive public debate and greater engagement by individuals and society.
112;The two tables below show the exchange students from universities in Europe to Australia between 2007 and 2009.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The two tables indicate the international students from universities in Europe to Australia, and from Australian universities to universities in Europe between 2007 and 2009. Overall, An increase in total can be seen from European students to Australia in 2009, while the total number of Australian student remained the same from 2007 to 2009.To go into detail, there are two countries the number of students increased from European international students to Australia. Specifically, It is Sweden, and Germany. It was 34,27 in 2007 in Sweden and Germany, whereas it was 42 and 62 in Sweden and Germany in 2009 respectively. Especially in German students, the number doubled. On the other hand, other countries, such as France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherland can be seen a slight reduction from 2007 to 2009. But the total number increased from 189 to 226, in 2007, and 2009.When it comes to Australian international students who study in Europe, have not changed the total number of students. It is 152, in 2007 and 2009. On the other hand, the number of students soared in two countries, such as France, and Germany.It was 37, 18 in France, and Germany in 2007 respectively. It increased to 58, 26 in France and Germany. In contrast, there are reduction in three countries, in Sweden, The United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Especially in the Netherland, the number of Australian students plummeted from 32 to 18 between 2007 and 2009.France and Germany in 2009.; It is interesting to note that the total number of students who took part in the exchange programme from European universities to Australian universities increased from 2007 to 2008, and fell in 2009. This suggests a fluctuating trend in international exchange programmes. Germany had the highest number of exchange students in 2007, accounting for 21% of the total, which rose to 26% in 2008 and then fell slightly to 21% in 2009. It is noticeable that the number of exchange students was significantly lower in 2007 than in the following two years, but it rose significantly in 2008 to Y, which demonstrates an increase in interest and participation in exchange programmes. The number of exchange students from the UK showed greater fluctuations. It started strongly in 2007 with X students, but fell in the following year, perhaps because of a reduction in interest in exchange programmes or because of competition from other countries. On the other hand, the number of exchange students from France increased steadily from Y in 2007 to Z in 2009, which may reflect an increase in popularity of the French exchange students. Finally, while some countries, such as Spain and Italy, had lower numbers of exchange students than others, their numbers rose steadily from 2007 to 2009. This indicates that despite the variations in participation among different countries, Australia continued to attract students from Europe. The number of exchange students from the UK fell from X in 2007 to Z in 2009, and remained below its initial number. In conclusion, although there was an overall increase in the exchange students from Europe to Australia over the period of study, there were considerable variations between countries, with some countries increasing while others declined. These variations may be due to a variety of factors, such as the availability of air travel, the nature of university courses and international relationships between individual universities.
661;The typical teaching situation of a teacher and students in the class will not exist by the year 2050. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;For many years, the traditional teaching and learning (T&L) approach, i.e., having a teacher disseminating knowledge to a group of students in a classroom, is dominent over the world.With the advancement of information and communication technology, new learning approaches have been proposed and adopted. For example, students can now use computers to surf the internet to find information or knowledge they would like to study. Moreover, a number of pre-recorded education contents are now available online to provide classes/tutorials to learners. It is expected that this tradition T&L approach will not exist by 2050. Would it be true?There is no doube that there is an increasing number of T&L approaches due to emergence of new technologies. Together with the new approaches, we see there is a shift of the role of teachers these years, not only as one who is responsible to disseminate knowledge, but also a faciliator of learning. Teachers provide proper directions to students during their study, where current technology is not able to offer. Some people say the artificial technology is a threat, but still the accuracy of providing suggestions to students is not very high. Moreover, human teachers are able to provide emotional support to students. Studying is not just a robotic process of human beings. Students may encounter difficulties during the learning process and feel frustrated, which will eventually affect their progression in study. Human teachers could be more aware on this situation, not by the numeric assessment results, but the emotional behaviour of the students in the classroom, and provide prompt and proper counselling support and advice to the students.Also, it is still well-known that computers, even with AI, are weak in creating new knowledge. In the university setting, other than teaching the conventional knowledge, professors would disseminate their new research findings to the students in the class, with discussion among the students, inspiring them to the unexplored areas. This T&L process can only be effective when it happens in a classroom setting.In conclusion, technology may alter the way how we teach and learn. In spite of this, human teachers are also adaptive and certain roles of the teachers cannot be replaced by other tools or machines. Therefore, I believe that the tradition classroom T&L setting cannot be replaced completedly in the future.; For example, I can agree that the teaching situation will change drastically in the future, but I do not agree that it will be abolished. It is conceivable that in 2050 the model of the class in which the teacher stands in front of the class and delivers knowledge to a group of students may seem outdated. Probably the platform will be increasingly oriented towards project-oriented and project-based learning in virtual reality, instead of purely individual instruction. It will also be possible to teach the students vital skills such as critical thinking and cooperation in virtual reality. The social side of the teaching situation, however, creates a valuable learning environment that cannot be easily replaced by technology. Teachers offer something more than purely academic instruction, they offer guidance, support and emotional support, and this is important for the students' development. Furthermore, the learning situation in the class is about social interaction and the development of communication skills. Although technology can facilitate learning, the absence of direct human contact may prevent the students from learning how to handle real social situations. In addition, teachers are an important source of creativity and curiosity, which is essential for innovation in a rapidly changing world. In conclusion, although the teaching situation will probably be influenced by technology in many ways by the year 2050, it will continue to play an important role in the learning process and instead of disappearing, it will adapt to the needs of the future. Probably the teacher-student relationship will change, but instead of disappearing, it will adapt to the future needs of the learners.
803;The use of corporal punishment (physically hitting students) in schools is in decline, yet it should be used to improve behaviour.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people believe that modifying behaviour among school-going children can be achieved through corporal punishment, and that it being on the decline in schools, is actually a negative development. I strongly disagree with this this view as I am of the opinion that there are better ways of disciplining children to instill positive behaviour, than physically hitting them.Improvement of behaviour among children in schools can be achieved through teaching them good manners rather than using corporal punishment. This means that teachers and school staff should teach children acceptable and unacceptable behaviour as part of their school curriculum from the earleist age they enter school. This way, learners obtain knowledge required for them to practice good behaviour. For example, if a child is taught from primary school-going age that they should clean after their mess, they are likely to practise and carry this behaviour through to secondary school. That way, there would be no need to physically hit children. Although some may firmly believe that corporal punishment is a good form of discipline, it cannot be compared to the actual teaching of good behaviour.Moreover, corporal punishment is likely to produce a fearful and resentful child rather than a well mannered child. It has been found by many researchers that children are unlikely to change their bad behaviour because they are beaten up at school. The behaviour is most likely to get worse, instead, as learners become fearful and resent their learning environment. For instance, in South Africa, some learners were reported to be disrespectful to their teachers because of a bad relationship that existed between them and their teachers as a result of corporal punishment that was inflicted on them. While it may be true that some positive behaviour changes were seen among pupils due to use of corporal punishment, this is at a very small scale.In conclusion, I am of the view that the use of corporal punishment among school-going age children is not a desirable phenomenon, as it is unlikely to produce any required behavioural changes. Instead, instilling good manners in learners through teaching them is more effective, as physically hitting them may even worsen their undesirable behaviour.; I do not think that corporal punishment should be used in schools and that its decline is a good sign of the development of more positive methods for improving behaviour. Corporal punishment, the physical disciplining of students, has been a controversial issue in education for a long time. Some teachers claim that it is an effective way to discipline children and improve their behaviour. But the majority of teachers, psychologists and child development experts think it is ineffective and harmful to children. Corporal punishment has many negative psychological effects on children, including increased anxiety, depression and aggressiveness. These negative psychological effects go against the goals of education, which is to create a safe and supportive learning environment. This is why the decline in the use of corporal punishment has led to the development of more effective methods of improving behaviour, such as restorative justice, positive reinforcement and social-emotional learning. For example, in some countries where corporal punishment is still used, children often feel more fear than motivation, which has a negative effect on their academic performance and their experiences at school. There are many examples of schools, such as Finland, where the success of education is remarkable and students are taught in a positive and respectful manner, without the need for corporal punishment. In conclusion, the decline of corporal punishment in schools is a sign of the development of more effective and more healthy methods of managing behaviour. Instead of relying on physical discipline, education should seek out more compassionate and supportive strategies that can promote understanding and growth. It is very important for education to focus on the mental and emotional health of students, as this will eventually lead to better learning outcomes and a better learning environment.
623;The use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction among many people in society. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;The modern world of social interaction changed completely over the past decades. Now many of us spent much more time interracting through social media, messengers for private or corporate messaging. We also use video conference and sharing our workflow remotely.As for me we have different needs satisfied by communication formed by different systems in our brain. On the one hand we have we communicate with each other aiming to get a useful information. On the other hand communication gives some non-verbal part like a sense of neing involved into one process, belonging to a circle of friends, collegues or family. These two sides of the process of communication are implemented differently that's why each part gets its own advantages and disadvantages thanks to changing integrating new social network technologies.If to talk about an information exchange - as for it became much more efficient with using messages, cloud storages and different coworking tools. But it is true only for those people who use these technology well. As far as I can see many advantages in remote work such as possibility not to waste time for commuting, offices and separate equipment, many people notice that their remote collegues disapperar often and avoid their duties. Some people couldn't concentrate while working at home. As for me people who experince such a problems are just addicted to strong stimules such as face-to face interraction and being managed by their boss. At the same time different internet based tools allow you to share much more information much faster and forever. Now you cannot just forget you task because you can always revise it in your work messenger and cloud folder wherever and whenever you are.One another need - is to have a social interraction. Of course ssocial network give us some advantage even in this area - now we can keep our relationships with more people across longer distances. While moving to another city or country we do not feel isolation so much anymore. It allows us to mentain or ralationships longer and stronger. At the same time such an option give people a possibility to avoid face-to-face communication with people phisically close to them. As for me it gives only one disadvantage - it is getting harder to load some parts of our brain which are evolutionary oriented to face-to-face interraction.I can conclude that social media interraction gave us some new possibilities and cut off some of the old ones. At the same time modern technologies blur boundaries between a real conversation and internet communication. Now we can perfectly see and hear each-other and even support financially. There are also some devises wich allow you to feel even more - like touches or heartrythm of each other. I think that new social media tools and some next directions of these tools will satisfy our face-to-face communication needs more and more over time.; One of the most important advantages of social media is that it connects people all over the world. Although this may have its advantages, it is important to consider whether the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. As the world is getting smaller, people can maintain contact with each other through platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. In times of crisis or at an international event such as the Influenza A pandemic, when it is difficult to meet in person, this closeness creates a sense of community and belonging for users who might otherwise feel lonely. However, these benefits also have disadvantages. The loss of face-to-face contact weakens people's social skills, making them unable to cope with emotional situations in real life. For this reason, it is important to keep the use of social media in balance by facilitating the development of communication skills and face-to-face contact. In addition, the anonymity of social media leads to various negative social behaviours, such as cyberbullying, which has severe psychological consequences for the victims. Finally, to be emotionally healthy, it is important to develop trusting relationships with others. In some cases, this can lead to more disadvantages than advantages.
76;The world health organization recommends that people should eat five or more portion of fruit and vegetables per day. The bar chart shows the percentage of males and females in the UK by age group in 2006.You should write at least 150 words.;This bar chart depicts the percentage between male and female to eat five or above portion of fruit and vegetables per day in the UK. It is clear from the graph that the female is higher than male of percentage.According to what is shown, gradually increased from 19 to 34 ages same that from 35 to 54 ages. Between 55 and 64 ages is siginficant increased about between 19 and 24 ages, After that gradually decreased between 65 and 74. Although, Supposed to 25 and 34 ages, They the more consum but between 55 and 64 ages they is consum the highest. Also, The 75 age is the same percentage, unlike the all under 75 ages.To sum up, we could say that, the all ages is not equal between male and female in same percentage ages, except 75 age, They slight by 25 per cent between unisex. On other hand, Female and male is equal consume in 75 age.; The bar chart shows the percentage of males and females by age in the UK in 2006.The WHO recommends five or more portions of fruit and vegetables per day to help prevent chronic diseases and to support a healthy lifestyle. This graph shows interesting trends in diet and lifestyle. For example, in younger age groups the percentage of people meeting the recommendations is probably lower than in older age groups. This could be due to lifestyle choices, availability of fresh food and understanding of dietary guidelines. In general, women have a higher consumption of fruit and vegetables than men. This could be due to different perceptions of healthy eating or different preparation practices. Increasing the consumption of fruit and vegetables in all age groups is a key public health issue. To conclude, the WHO’s recommendation is a good starting point for encouraging healthy eating from an early age. With education campaigns, community programs and policies aimed at increasing access to affordable fresh food, the percentage of people meeting the WHO recommendations can be significantly increased. Healthy eating from an early age can help reduce the health costs of diseases associated with poor diet.
1426;The world is experiencing a dramatic increase in population, which is causing problems not only for poor, undeveloped countries, but also for industrialized and developed nations. Describe some of the problems that overpopulation causes, and suggest at least one possible solution.;You should write at least 250 words.You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.Nowadays, the population dramatically in most countries around the world. This is true for the developed and developing nations. Overpopulation a different number of problems. However, the government can these problems in many .There are several problems that the raising number of people in undeveloped countries causes. Firstly, it is very difficult to provide enough food for all people. Secondly, the government limits the number of children per family in school. In addition, in poorest countries usually have , and when the population increases, the number of . Finally, when too many people live on the land, the environment suffers.There are different problems that overpopulation causes in rich nations. Firstly, it is very difficult for governments to provide helpful public services in overcrowded cities. Moreover, there is generally a higher level of crimes being committed, such as drugs abuse, murders, thefts, . often cause by the high rates of unemployment.However, overpopulation problems in nations have two main which they are by governments. Firstly, the government must educate people about limiting the size of the family. For example, in China they have a policy called “one child policy” which limits the size of the family to one or two children, and this is beginning to have an effect on the world’s most crowded nation.To sum up, if the impulsive population increase continues, many more people will die of hunger in the poor countries. Also, in rich nations, the life in the cities will become more and more difficult.; Among the most serious problems of overpopulation is the exhaustion of natural resources. Overpopulation leads to resource exhaustion, increases the danger of the environment, increases the number of social conflicts, and hinders the development of cities. The lack of resources and spaces in the cities of the United States and Europe is also a problem, which causes a growing demand for housing and infrastructure, overloads the city and is the cause of crowding and increasing pollution. Among the most serious problems caused by overpopulation is the need for food, water and energy, especially in poor countries where there is a lack of food and water, but also in the developed countries. Overpopulation has also led to increased poverty and an increase in social conflicts in cities. In addition, overpopulation has aggravated the danger to the environment, for it leads to the disappearance of forests, to the reduction of the number of animals and the destruction of natural areas. Overpopulation leads to increased production, to deforestation, to the reduction of the number of animals, to increased carbon emissions, to climate change. Moreover, in countries where overpopulation is the reason for mass migration, tensions between natives and foreigners occur, which aggravates the national debate on the integration of foreigners and the situation of nationals. Overpopulation can also lead to social unrest. In densely populated areas, competition for jobs increases, and social inequality and conflicts often arise. So overpopulation can lead to unemployment and poverty. One solution to the problems of overpopulation could be to support family planning and education, especially in countries where birth rates are high. By providing full reproductive health care and education, people can make informed decisions about family size.
1313;There are many things that can motivate people to perform well in their work. These can include the salary, job satisfaction or the chance to help others. What do you feel is the best motivation to do well at work?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"To perform well in a job, people have to be motivated. There are multiple strategies for employers to incentivise their employees. The most obvious one is the salary; however, job satisfaction and the ability to help people are other methods of improving performance at work.For the majority of the people, receiving their salary at the end of the month is their motivation. This is because money is necessary to fulfill the most basic needs and other materialistic desires. Employees see these opportunities when receiving their salary and therefore work to achieve money. Furthermore, performing well in a job can often lead to promotions with higher pay packages. To receive this, staff have to stand out positively in their jobs. Salary is therefore a key motivational tool for many workforce participants.However, money is far from being the only incentive. Another aspect affecting performance is job satisfaction. If a person is comfortable in their work, they are more likely to perform well. Therefore this motivational tool interlinks with salary, as when people are content and perform well, the chances of promotion increase. For some individuals though, only their passion can drive them. Prime examples for this are humanitarian jobs. The salaries are often not very high, but those choosing to work in this field are often very driven; their passion to help others is prioritised over their own salary.In conclusion, while income might be the most common motivational factor, it is unusual to be the sole incentive for working hard, and some people are motivated wholly due to other reasons."; The motivation to do well at work is a very complex and individual matter. While it is clear that salary and job satisfaction are important elements in an individual’s ability to perform well, it is my view that the most important motivation for many employees is the chance to help others. This kind of internal motivation not only motivates them to perform well but also makes them feel happy. For example, many nurses and doctors often cite the desire to help patients as a key reason for choosing their careers. When employees engage in tasks that help others they often feel a deep satisfaction. And in addition, working to help others can lead to a closer teamwork and a stronger sense of community. The emotional rewards of helping a patient recover or be made comfortable often exceed the benefits of a salary. In my view, while salary and job satisfaction are important, the personal satisfaction and happiness of helping others is unique. For example, employees of non-profit organizations often feel a strong sense of duty to their work, and while their salaries are lower than those in the business sector, they are more likely to work overtime and go the extra mile. In this way, employees’ morale can be heightened and they perform better. In summary, while there are many factors that motivate people to perform well in their work, the chance to help others is often the best. Human beings are social beings and by strengthening their ties to others they can not only improve their work performance but also make them happier.
1284;There is a moral necessity today for the richer countries of the world to help the poorer countries develop in terms of feeding the population, education and health care. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The world today is often divided into two categories, more developed and less developed countries. This division is significant in terms of health, wealth and education. To minimise this gap, it is argued that richer countries are morally responsible to support the less wealthy. I, personally, feel that the prosperous countries are obligated and expected to to contribute to the development of countries with weaker economies.To address this argument, the history of the wealthy countries is relevant. Many less developed countries are former colonies, therefore the wealthy countries had a historical impact on the less wealthy. Thus, richer countries’ economies were dependent on the currently less developed countries for their rich status. Furthermore, even today the wealthy countries contribute to the wealth inequality by exploiting the inhabitants of less developed countries, giving workers lower wages than people within their own countries. Due to this dependence on poorer countries and the influence that the richer countries have had on the imbalance, it can be concluded that richer countries are indeed morally obliged to help the less wealthy countries.Opposing this is the view that each country is in charge of their own inhabitants and that therefore they need to provide health, education and basic necessities for themselves. In addition, simply providing these three services would not lead to closing the wealth gap. It would rather be helpful to invest sustainably in poorer countries and help them create their own systems, allowing these countries to be self-sufficient.In conclusion, while there is a moral necessity for wealthy countries to aid the poorer ones, simply providing basic necessities is not sufficient. A more sustainable idea would be to teach countries to plan and provide for themselves by giving economic incentives.; I totally agree with this statement. There are several reasons for this. First, hunger is still a major problem in many parts of the world. The world today is becoming more and more interconnected. According to a recent United Nations report, millions of people are undernourished, and children are weakened and their death rates are higher. Through the World Food Program, rich countries can donate not only food but also agricultural development, thereby promoting local food production. Second, education plays an important role in overcoming poverty. The education of the individual raises the entire community. Rich countries can help to establish schools, provide teachers and materials such as books and technology. Third, health care is an absolute human right. In many poorer countries, access to medical care is limited, and so many lives are lost to preventable diseases. The World Bank has successfully raised funds to improve education in some of the world's poorest countries, and this is a practical example of international cooperation. The world's response to the Influenza A (H5N1) pandemic in 2009 shows that cooperation is the only way to deal with the outbreak of such epidemics. Rich countries have the resources to support vaccination programs and health care facilities. In short, as the world's economy becomes increasingly interconnected, so the world's responsibility to achieve a fairer world increases. It is not only a question of charity, but a matter of common welfare, peace and prosperity.
1217;There is growing evidence that man-made activities are making global temperatures higher.What might be the man-made causes of temperatures rising? How should we deal with this problem?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In the last years the problem of global warming is becaming more and more debated. One of the main causes of the temperature rising are men-made activities. Almost all the activities made by humans produce a huge impact on the natural environment. For instance, some of the usual activities made daily by people are impacting. Indeed, the chemical products they buy and use as well as the ways of trasportation's abuse can be annoverated among the main reasons for global warming. Lastly, even if it is the more impacting, there is the industral system and their production of slags.The first impact made by men-activities concerns the product they use. There are at least three kinds of products that may cause the rising of temperature. First, there are products like lacquaer and foam. Because they were beed uncontrolled used during the last decades, they have been one of the main causes of the Ozone Hole. Spray products, even if they are just suncream or hair conditionars could be very impacting because of their chemical composition. Another men-activity that impact a lot on the environment concern their use of the way of transportation. Indeed, the abuse of private ways of trasportation caused an increasement of pollution and a dramatic increase of the level of petrol in the environment. Petrol is not only one of the main reason for global warming but also the first responsible for sea's pollution. Furthermore, the dayly use of flight cause pollution in the air and now restriction on the abuse of this way of trasportation are trying to be a kind of solution to the problem.Lastly, one of the main causes of global temperatures higher is the industrial system. Indeed, they used to point to the cheaper solution to produce and eliminate the radioactive waste. The problem of a prodaction that does not take care of the environment pointed to use polluting products and machines. Furthermore, the industrial system point to produce more and more causing the waste of energy and raw materials. For instance, the fashion industry is one of the more pulluting in the world. It abuses of materials and energies whithout caring abuut the waste of them. Finally, the problem of the way in which the industries procede in elimnating waste is crucial. Indeed, in the last years they used to disperse the waste on the sea. This tendecy was increased for two reasosns: saving and speed. These are the two eassential words of industrial system.In conclusion, I think there are two main reasons that cause the raising of global temperatures that can be annoverated among the others. Those that concern the personal and daily activities of men (use of determinate products and ways of trasportation) and then those activities operate by the industrial system.; The main human-made causes of global temperatures rising are industrial activity, deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels. All these activities have a considerable influence on the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which trap heat and thus lead to climate change. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the largest contributor to global warming is the burning of fossil fuels. Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas for energy and transportation leads to the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The greater use of vehicles, power plants and factories increases the production of these greenhouse gases. Deforestation is another important factor in the change of climate. Plants are carbon sinks and absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In large cities the increasing use of petrol and diesel cars and other vehicles is one of the main reasons for the rise in temperatures. These days in the Amazon rain forest extensive deforestation for cattle and soy production is having a serious influence on the climate. When forests are felled for agriculture, building or forestry the sinks are reduced and carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere. In order to deal with this problem a number of different measures should be taken. There should be stricter control of the use of fossil fuels by governments, through taxation and the implementation of trading schemes and restrictions on the use of polluting fuels. A greater use of hydro-power, solar energy and other sources of renewable energy should be encouraged. Reforestation and the careful management of forests are important ways of increasing the sinks. We should do all we can to encourage sustainable practices and by educating the public we can work towards a healthier planet for future generations. In conclusion, while human activity is a major contributor to the rising of global temperatures, we can still take measures to deal with this.
1427;There is no longer enough natural resources to sustain current levels of economic growth. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Recently, the natural resources risen dramatically across the world due to population growth. Some people state that we enough resources. However, there are some individuals who disagree with this opinion. In this essay, the issues behind this phenomenon will be examined.On the one hand, some people state that if will continue to we cannot have a comfortable life because natural resources are limited. According to a if this situation will continue, the petrol will in 2050. Moreover, it is widely said that the will increase. This will make the amount of natural .On the other hand, there are some individuals who disagree with above-mentioned perception. The natural resources will technology. For example, the of technology such as cars a positive impact the society. By using this, we can the consumption of natural resources. Eventually, we will not need natural fuel. In my opinion, of natural is , I think the loss of it a negative impact the society because won’t have a comfortable life any more.In conclusion, I agree with the idea that there is no longer enough natural resources to sustain this situation. In order to our life, the governments countries should tackle this issue.; For the sake of a more industrialized world, it is necessary to evaluate critically our consumption habits and their implications for sustainable development. The assertion that there is no longer enough natural resources to sustain current levels of economic growth is both believable and disputed. Many studies have indicated that natural resources, especially fossil fuels, are becoming scarcer because of overexploitation and unsustainable practices, and a shift in our thinking about economic growth and resource consumption is needed. As populations continue to increase and developing countries compete with more industrialized countries for economic equality, the consumption of water, fossil fuels and arable land increases, and this increased consumption leads to increased emissions of greenhouse gases and the depletion of vital areas. And it is here that innovation and technology are of particular importance. New sources of energy such as wind, solar, hydro and advances in re-cycling and sustainable agriculture, indicate that it is possible to decouple economic growth from resource extraction. However, it can be argued that economic growth does not depend on the availability of natural resources. And in spite of the fact that current trends in resource consumption are unsustainable, it does not necessarily mean that growth should be halted. Rather, it is an invitation to reconsider the aims of growth in terms of efficiency, technology and sustainable development. The use of innovation and technology makes it possible to find a balance between economic growth and sustainable use of natural resources.
1324;These days, many young people are not spending their weekends and holidays doing outdoor activities such as hiking or mountaineering. Why is that happening? How can they be encouraged to spend more time in the natural environment?;Nowadays, the younger generation tends to avoid recreational activities such as hiking or alpinism. It seems that young people prefer to spend their weekends indoors, gaming or engaging in other online activities. If that is the case, by promoting sports more actively and organising sports competitions, the schools could counteract this trend.Living in the era of technology, the wide availability and variety of online entertainment are compelling young people to spend a lot of their free time indoors, using their gadgets. Numerous relatively cheap forms of amusement, such as online games, videos, audiobooks and plenty of other activities, tempt teenagers to stay at home and lead more sedentary lifestyles. A recent survey revealed that the vast majority of students would prefer spending their weekends playing computer games, rather than in the nature. That is one clear reason why our modern youth is less interested in recreational sports.To address this issue, the school management could intervene and offer a better range of outdoor sports activities and competitions, both within the school curriculum and as extra-curricular activities. For example, high schools could increase the number of weekly football, running and climbing classes, and organise competitions at the end of each term. As a result, pushed by their desire to win, students would do more walking, jogging, running and mountaineering during the school term, in preparation for the competition. This would reduce the time spent online, lessen the students’ dependence on the Internet for entertainment, and eventually boost their desire to spend more time enjoying the natural environment.To sum up, screen addiction plays a major role in young people’s avoidance of various outdoor activities. Opening up more recreational sports and offering frequent competitions on school grounds is a great way to motivate more students to spend their leisure time in the nature.; In our modern world, young people are choosing more and more to spend their time in an indoor environment, especially during the weekend and on holidays. This is partly due to the advent of modern technology. The other reason is that they have little knowledge about the benefits of nature. As we know, people are becoming more and more urbanized, and many young people are absorbed in the virtual world of smart phones, games consoles and social media, and this has a sedentary effect and reduces their contact with nature. In addition, the busy schedules of school and work have little free time. And when they are free, they would rather stay at home and relax, rather than go outdoors to do some sports. In a word, young people are more used to the convenience of life in cities and less willing to go outside for outdoor sports. In order to encourage young people to go outdoors, schools can hold lectures on the benefits of nature to their physical and mental health. In addition, the schools can set up some outdoor sports activities for students to participate in, so that they have the opportunity to learn and do some sports. In addition, communities can set up a plan to improve access to nature, and open up a park or hiking trail that is easily accessible to young people. Social media can also show the beauty and benefits of the natural environment to young people, which may also attract young people to participate in this activity.
919;To be labelled a ‘Work of Art’, a painting, sculpture or other art form should display certain qualities that are unique. However, over the past century there has been a decline in the quality of prize-winning artwork and it is now possible for quite ordinary pieces of art to be labelled ‘masterpieces ’ whilst true works of art pass unnoticed.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;For centuries, artworks have been titled  'Work of Art' based on their extraordinary qualities. However, some people argue that nowadays, the standards are decreasing and the labelling of substandard artworks as 'masterpieces' has become ubiquitous. The upcoming essay will discuss why I agree that original paintings are being neglected while usual ones are being praised.Firstly, the superficial nature of humans is responsible for this change. These days, people do not see the meaning behind the painting or the message the artist is trying to convey rather they buy those paintings which are popular and contemporary. To illustrate it further, in art auctions it can be seen that when one person bids on one painting, no matter whether it is good or bad, others also start putting their money on it. Thus it is clear that normal art forms are winning prizes due to public attention.Secondly, some artists might bribe the organizers of exhibitions to promote their canvas. Indeed, there have been some recorded instances when artists were caught while signing up deals to increase the sales of their work. If a certain artwork receives publicity then it is impossible that it would not have an influence on the public. This type of promotion skews a person's opinion about a certain picture and so are forced to think about purchasing it, leaving behind original ones. Therefore, it is apparent that the diabolical activities of painters are responsible for their works being labelled as masterpieces.To conclude, the maintenance of social position and influence of painters are the prime causes for the popularity of ordinary artworks and the negligence of true works. Hence I agree with the given statement.; I agree that mediocre works of art are often celebrated as masterpieces, whereas truly remarkable ones are ignored. I also agree that the notion of a work of art has changed over the years, especially in the past century. There has been a tendency towards an avant-garde conception of art, based on personal expression rather than on traditional technique. This has led to a great increase in the number of non-artistic objects, such as everyday objects and digitally-generated images, being exhibited as art. One reason for this is the increasing subjectivity of art criticism and the evaluation of art. These objects stimulate discussion and are often thought-provoking, but they often lack the skill and depth of true masterpieces. Another factor is the commercialization of art. For example, a famous piece by Maurizio Cattelan – a banana taped to a wall – was sold for an enormous amount of money. As a result, mediocre works of art are able to gain recognition and commercial success at the expense of truly outstanding ones. This may be because galleries and art festivals have a tendency to respond to trends in the art market, rather than genuine artistic innovation, and this may put pressure on artists to conform to the prevailing trends rather than to express their own ideas. Perhaps the values and criteria for appreciating art should be re-evaluated in order to ensure that true masterpieces are not overlooked. In conclusion, although art must evolve, it is disturbing that in the modern world, ordinary art is too often celebrated as a masterpiece, at the expense of what has traditionally been considered truly great art.
1338;Today children are spending much more time watching TV compared to the past. Why do you think this happens? Is this a positive or a negative change?;"A trend has emerged in the last two decades with youngsters watching more TV than ever before. One of the main reasons behind this issue is the recent advancements in technology in gaming and film industries. This tendency has both pros and cons, and will be further discussed in this essay.The latest developments in video game consoles attracted both children and adults to spend extra time watching TV, compared to the past. With interactive gaming characters and high quality graphics, children are more likely to spend long hours playing games in front of the TV. A recent survey showed that TV addiction among young people, for example, has significantly increased from 5% to 80%, which was supposedly caused by the introduction of advanced gaming consoles. This increase is also partially due to films, drama series and cartoons being easily available on pirated websites and various gaming platforms.This trend has had more negative than positive effects on young citizens. More time spent watching TV adversely affects the mental and physical wellbeing of a child. For instance, the obesity ratio among young individuals in the past 10 years has risen dramatically; this has caused further health problems such as anxiety and depression. However, TV can also be used in a positive way. It is a great source of information that can help youngsters increase their knowledge and succeed in their future careers.In conclusion, recent breakthroughs in technology are driving up the amount of time our youngsters are spending in front of their TV screens. This can do more harm than good if we don’t regulate the use of TV, but parents have the power to make TV time useful and beneficial for their children."; A major reason for this increase in time spent on the screen is the proliferation of new technology. There are many reasons for this phenomenon, and there is much debate about whether this change is good or bad. With new animation, new possibilities for interactivity and the ability to choose what to watch, young people have found a new pastime that they are not losing to many other media. In the past, children had limited access to the content of the TV, mostly because of the time they could watch and the few channels they could watch. Today, with the help of new technology, children have many more opportunities to watch their favorite programs. They can watch the newest cartoons and games whenever they want, and their parents are less bothered to keep them busy. Another reason for the increase in time spent watching is the changing social circumstances. With the increasingly busy life of parents, they often choose to keep their children busy in front of the screen. With the spread of digital devices such as tablets and smart phones, children can easily watch whenever they want. With this rise, the borders between traditional and digital media have become less clear. Children have less and less time to play and learn. In conclusion, although the increased time children spend watching can be explained by both technological development and changing social circumstances, it is important to remember the possible adverse effects. Parents and guardians should strive for balance, so that the use of the screen does not replace other healthy activities and relationships. Prolonged use of the screen reduces social interactivity and reduces physical activity, which are both important for the development of children.
603;Today family members do not eat meals together. Why does this happen? Is this a positive or negative developmentGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Dinner tables are no longer a place for family reunion in today's society. Reasons from many aspects account for this phenomenon which pose a huge threat to the happiness of family and the harmony of society.Causes vary from person to person. Some people, especially the young believing that conflicts are common on dinner tables, tend to have meals with their friends rather than their family members. But most people are deprived of their rights by the development of society. Too busy to get home at dinner time, people have to eat meals near workplace. Also, with the job diversity increasing, rarely can family members with different timetables eat meals at the same period. For instance, a bank agent getting home at 6 pm tends to miss her doctor husband leaving home at 5 pm for emergency work.It is the advantages of sharing meals with family that attach great importance to this event. Time for communication is so critical that families lacking such opportunities are often full of misunderstandings and quarrels. Not only can this development increase the divorce rate but it may also decrease the marriage rate. Because support and care from family, the previous harbor, is deprived and people see no significance from getting married. With such phenomenon prevailing, the negative emotions may take advantage in the society. Loneliness, distress and helplessness stike those always eating alone.In a nutshell, taking the damage to both families and societies into consideration, various solutions should be put forward to the roots behind the situation.; That this is a symptom of a modern society, others may argue, is a disadvantage for families. I argue that it is a harmful development that can cause family disintegration and misunderstanding. According to a survey by the Pew Research Center, over 60 percent of families say that their daily life is so full that it is difficult to agree on mealtimes. The most important reason for why families no longer share meals is that life is so busy. Parents have demanding jobs and obligations, and the children are active and have their own commitments. In addition, technological development has played a role, for the proliferation of smartphones and tablets has created an environment where family members would rather consume content than communicate with each other. Consequently, family members eat at different times, hurry and do not eat together, they eat fast food and take-away food. The effect of this development is mainly negative. What has been a moment for contact between family members is now reduced to a moment of silence and the tapping of fingers on screens. In addition, it is a study that has shown that families who eat together are more satisfied and have fewer problems with their children's behavior. Moreover, family meals also encourage health because they are usually more nutritionally balanced. It is a fundamental part of family life that family members can meet, share experiences and develop communication skills. Consequently, it is a sign of regret that family members have so few opportunities to meet and communicate, especially around the dinner table. In conclusion, the fact that families no longer share their meals together because of a hectic pace and the development of technology is a problem. The need to be together at mealtimes is therefore an important factor for the family.
883;Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;There is no doubt that nowadays advertising plays a very strong role in saling goods. The high rate of sales does not always mean the real needs of some goods. In this essay, i will discuss both views and draw my personal conclusion.In terms of advertising's power in increasing sales of popular consumer goods, advertising has an essencial role these days in sales. The main reason given to support this claim is advertisnig attracts people and inform people about the new and special products in a very special way. To illustrate, using social media for marketing and advertising raise sales dramatecly. People spend most of their times to watch what is in the social media and that means social media is the best way to do your marketing.However, some people say that people buy these products not because they really need them but because they like the way that was used to advertise these products. On the other hand, some times people purchase goods because they have seen them or heard about them from others or from the social media not due to their needs of these products.In conclusion, I believe that increasing the sales of some popular consumer goods show how strong is advertising and how advertising plays a crucial role in saling products. Also, smart business owners should think about advertising as a fast way to sale their goods. As was previously menthond, people can be attracted by all kinds of advertising and that definitly lead to increasing the sale rate.; Advertisements have a strong influence on consumers and their demand, often convincing them to buy products they would not otherwise have considered. The phenomenon is caused by highly developed marketing strategies that appeal to the emotions, aspirations and status of consumers. The high sales of popular goods in today's society are a reflection of the power of advertising. However, it would be simplistic to assert that these sales do not fully correspond to the real needs of the population. Advertisements may excite the desire for certain goods, but they operate within a wider context that involves societal needs. For example, the extensive advertising of products and technologies for health and a healthy lifestyle is an obvious example. The influence of social media and celebrity testimonials on the advertising audience further intensifies this effect and can be easily mistaken for needs. It is also worth noting that consumerism and advertising do not exist in isolation from cultural and social phenomena. For example, in times of crisis, such as during the recent epidemic, consumers show a greater interest in products that meet their immediate needs, such as hand cleaners and fitness equipment, demonstrating that practical needs are able to boost sales despite broader advertising efforts. In this case, advertising corresponds closely to the real needs of society for improved health and well-being. In my opinion, the sales of popular goods are influenced by advertising, but they are also a reflection of the real needs and desires of the population. The trend is to reflect changes in lifestyles and priorities in society as a whole, which are becoming more inclined towards comfort and convenience. It is important to examine the relationship between advertisements and sales, as there are many aspects to it, some of which are manipulative and others which are responsive.
1328;Today’s young generation is facing many problems at school and at home. What are the problems? What can parents do to help their teenage children?;"Young people today are under a lot of pressure, which seems to come from many directions. The problems they are experiencing happen not only at school, but also at home, and it seems that without adult guidance, our young generation will continue to struggle.Teenage years have never been simple, and many would agree that the amount of challenges has only increased with the passage of time. Bullying has been a problem for quite a while, and children and adolescents would have experienced it at school in the past, but then it would stop at home. At present, however, things have been made worse by social media penetrating the supposedly safe space of our teenagers. The unfortunate behaviour of their peers can now reach them even in their bedrooms, causing them constant distress.Another issue troubling many young people is the pressure to succeed by their families. Whether at school or at home, they often feel as if they are not smart enough, which creates overwhelm and despair. Understandably, their parents are pursuing a worthy goal of ensuring their children get a great start in life; however, many teens feel that they are failing their families when they don’t live up to their expectations. This often leads to dishonest and unethical behaviour, such as cheating on tests or plagiarising other students’ work. When uncovered, these incidents have a profound effect on young people’s future careers, not to mention their emotional well-being.It is hard to underestimate the importance of parental support to navigating life as a young person. From helping teens build a positive body image and self-esteem, to handling classmates’ difficult behaviour, to guidance where study is concerned, parents can make a world of difference. Talking to their sons and daughters about matters that worry them, listening and making non-judgmental suggestions are great ways to help. Getting a professional involved where necessary and engaging with teachers, councilors and coaches is another opportunity for parents to provide assistance. Last but not least, parents can make their children better and happier people by simply giving them unconditional love.To sum up, being a young person in the modern world isn’t easy. By banding together and paying careful attention to their teens, families can help them overcome any obstacles to becoming successful adults."; In the schools, there is a lot of pressure on students for academic performance, and they are under great pressure. The most pressing issues are the mental health of the young generation and the family relationship. At home, the problems are also very difficult. Such problems as bullying and the distraction of the Internet have become even more serious, which is why it is difficult for the young generation to focus on their studies and make friends. Various family troubles, such as divorce or poverty, are difficult for children to endure and often lead to mental illness and loneliness. Parents have an important role to play in helping their teenage children. Parents need to pay attention to open communication with their children, so that their children can freely express their thoughts and feelings, so that their children feel secure, so that they can guide them, and so that their children can understand their feelings. Encourage them to exercise regularly, sleep enough, and find hobbies to relieve stress. Parents can also proactively educate themselves about the problems their children are facing, from academic pressure to mental health awareness, and help their children with their children. Parents are always attentive, caring and knowledgeable, and are not only able to help their children overcome the difficulties they face, but also to help them grow up in a better world.
1310;Tourism today creates a variety of problems, such as pollution due to flights, transport and dirty water.Do you think that governments should impose extra taxes on flights or accommodation to restrict today’s tourism industry?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Travelling today is simple to the extent that within twelve hours one can travel from Europe to Singapore, crossing nearly the whole globe. Based on this simplicity, tourism has changed significantly over the years. While in the past a family would be proud to drive two hours to a lake, many families now think nothing of travelling to the far side of the world. This also has a downside as increased pollution is a result. Extra taxes on flights or accommodation have therefore been offered as a solution so as to increase the cost of tourism and reduce its popularity.No matter what major transportation is used, travelling creates pollution. To decrease the amount of pollution caused by tourism, the tourism industry itself would have to be weakened. If these increased taxes are based on travelling distance, people would be more willing to stay closer to their home country, as for many even a slight increase would mean that their planned holidays would be too expensive. Accommodation taxes would raise holiday costs no matter the distance travelled. Therefore, if increased taxes were levied on travel and accommodation, tourism and therefore pollution would decrease.On the other hand, the main transport methods that would be impacted by imposing extra taxes would be communal ones, such as planes, trains and buses, and increasing the taxes would also impact non-tourists. Also, holidays are a vital part of ordinary people’s lives, as they escape from work and stress, and get to spend valuable time with their families. Stopping people travelling would greatly impact some simple pleasures of ordinary life.In conclusion, while tourism impacts the environment significantly, simply introducing extra taxes on transport or accommodation is a drastic measure. It could be more valuable to change the methods of transportation to decrease pollution, instead making people stay close to home.; It is well known that one of the most serious sources of pollution in the tourism industry is air travel, which accounts for a significant proportion of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Since there is a growing concern about climate change and the degradation of the environment, it is important to discuss whether governments should impose higher taxes on air travel and accommodation to reduce these problems. For example, Sweden has introduced an aviation tax, which has resulted in a decrease in the number of flights and therefore a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, a number of accommodation establishments are also under increasing pressure to adopt energy-saving and waste-reduction practices. Higher taxes on flights could discourage tourists from flying, and encourage them to use other forms of transportation, such as trains or local vacations. Also, revenue from these taxes can be used to support the development of public transport and investment in green technology. Similarly, hotels that have a higher tax on them could be encouraged to use alternative energy sources and adopt water-saving technology, which would not only reduce the waste generated by hotels, but also attract more tourists who are concerned about the environment. In short, higher taxes on air travel and accommodation can be an effective way for governments to reduce the harmful effects of tourism on the environment. While the industry is important for the economy, it is also important to maintain the balance between economic interests and sustainable development to protect the environment for future generations. In this way, we not only reduce pollution, but also improve the experience of tourists.
861;Traffic and housing problems could be solved by moving large companies, factories and their employees to the countryside.Do you agree or disagree?;Many metropolises are facing challenges, including traffic gams and serious lacking of housing available for families to live, particular in the developed countries. The governments are looking for a way to lessen the volume of traffic in the cities and to increase the number of housing provision over the metropolises. Some people advocate the businesses including large corporations and factories along with their employees moving to the suburbs which is the best way to figure out the metropolitan problems. Is this a sheer solution for these challenges faced by the cities?Economy boom in a country is accompanied with a number of problems incurred in the cities due to the multitudes living in there. It is no wonder that metropolises represent more job opportunities available and better education system to next generations. These are strong pull factors appealing people to stay in the cities despite the higher cost in living. A larger number of populations in the cities not only result in a severe shortage of housing where there is a higher demand of housing over the available supply, but also bring the higher volume of traffic across the cities, particular in a peak hour when a thousand and one employees commuting to work and students going to schools. Some people believe the working location shifting to rural areas is a solution that enables to lessen the frequent usage of roads in cities. Simultaneously, it is assumed that the housing issue can be solved naturally arising from the migration of their employees into the suburban town next to their working place.The business allocated to suburbs alone is rarely considered enough to tackle these problems. A place to live requires the basic facilities to serve for clothing, food, housing and transportation which are basic needs of human. If there is a working place and residential area only in the suburban town without any infrastructures, people have no choice to drive their vehicles back and forth between cities and their living places for the general consumption. As a consequence, the traffic congestion in cities will be worsen combining with the significant deterioration of air quality in the countryside due to an increase in the emission of the greenhouse gases. Therefore, the governments play a key role to establish a neighborhood which could be self-sufficient communities outside of their larger metropolitan areas. This may be a feasible and effective way to minimize the metropolitan issues.My own view is that the shifting strategies in suburbs can help lessen the challenges faced by metropolises. But the governments should take the smart planning into consideration in which the employment bases with the living infrastructures are developed in the suburban town.; One of the most serious problems in the city today is the lack of space. While I agree that such a shift could ease the burden on the city population, this solution is not as easy as it seems and must be approached with caution. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, relocating large companies from crowded areas could reduce the number of commuters and thus ease the burden on the city, especially public transport. In addition, it could make it easier for cities to maintain their areas and revive them. Secondly, the housing shortage in many cities is made worse by the workers coming to these large companies. This makes it even more difficult for families and individuals to find places to live. Thirdly, this would also have a positive effect on the quality of life of these people and their families, but in order to achieve this, a lot of work would need to be done on training the rural population. Fourthly, such a shift would be a positive development, but it should be approached carefully and with the long-term goal of sustainable development in mind. In conclusion, while it is true that relocating companies and factories to rural areas could relieve some of the burden on the city's traffic and housing, it is not without its problems.
1229;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;While some people argue that equal numbers of male and female students should be accepted in every major, I personally disagree with this statement.There are a number of arguments that can support my stance. To begin with, it is impossible to enroll equal genders of students in every subject. It is true that some faculties are underrepresented by a particular gender. For example, STEM subjects usually have more male students than females, but the opposite is true in educational-related subjects, which phenomenon seems to violate the principle that we fight endeavor today, gender equality. Therefore, people want to accept equal numbers of students to achieve a gender balance in every subject. However, the reality is that different genders prefer to study different subjects themselves, but not because of the unequal opportunity. According to one of the research, women show a higher interest in subjects like education, psychology and arts rather than science-related subjects. As a result, it is apparent that admitting equivalent proportions of male and female students can hardly be achieved.In addition, it will deprive students of chances to make their own choices if universities enroll both genders equally in every subject mandatorily. It should be noted that it is students' right to select the subjects freely in college. If students cannot register for the subjects they want to study just because there are not enough quotas left for particular gender of students, or they are forced to study some subjects they are not interested in just because they need to fulfill the gender requirement in the class, it will hinder students' learning in the long-run.To conclude, universities should not enroll equal gender students in every subject as it is impossible to achieve and may deprive students the freedom to choose the major they want to study.; That a more equal society should accept more equal people is a complex issue, which combines social attitudes, educational standards and personal preferences. It is important to achieve gender equality in education, but I think that it is wrong to force everyone to accept it, because this violates the distinctions between people. However, the introduction of strict quotas can lead to unexpected results. For example, the presence of women in the STEM subjects can inspire the younger generation and introduce a broader view of science and innovation, while men in the education and medical professions can question the socially accepted roles of men and women. These quotas, however, can harm the chances of people who don't feel that they are being accepted because of their merits and not for the quotas. A competent male student, for example, may not be admitted to a certain subject because of the quota, which may arouse the discontent and frustration of other students. Such a decision will violate the prestige of the university and could bring down the level of academic knowledge and interests. Instead, the university should try to provide an inclusive environment that will encourage all students, regardless of their gender, to explore different subjects, without imposing a strict gender balance. Moreover, the interests of various subjects are often gender-biased and are influenced more by education and aspirations than by prejudice. The most effective way to achieve gender equality in higher education is to provide an inclusive environment that will encourage people to explore different subjects, which will gradually create gender equality in the world, without quotas. In conclusion, while the equality of men and women in education is essential, it is not necessary to introduce a quota for each subject.
1433;Universities should allocate the same amount of money to their sport activities as they allocate to their libraries. Do you agree or disagree?;Yes, I do feel that universities should have an equal budget for their libraries as well as sport activities. It is our general belief that a good player can not be good student and hence we restrict our children’s sport activities at college level. Moreover, an academic degree has much more value than sport activities which naturally compels students to focus more on their studies than their interest in sport.Most of the universities keep sports at of their priority list, good players do not get enough facilities and to improve their skills and eventually they their interest.Universities can play substantial role in shaping this upcoming talent by providing good trainers and which is otherwise too expensive to afford. Also it will attract other students sports and inculcate importance of physical fitness in them.Universities should produce in all fields rather than only concentrating on progress of scholars. Hence, I feel that universities should allot equal amounts of money to as well as sport activities.; First of all, libraries play an important role in the education of students. The way universities allocate their budgets to sport and library activities is a matter of debate. I believe that universities should allocate the same amount of money to both these institutions, because they both play a key role in the education of students. An inadequate budget for the library can lead to a decrease in the learning process and thus in the academic development of students. The library is a place of study and knowledge, which is the core of a university's mission. They provide resources such as books, journals, access to digital data bases, which enable students to conduct thorough research and study. In a time when the sedentary life-style is so common, encouraging students to engage in physical activity is important for the development of a healthy lifestyle. On the other hand, sports activities play a vital role in the physical health and welfare of students. Moreover, sporting events foster a sense of school spirit and pride, which enhances the overall university experience. These experiences are not only beneficial to the students’ personal development but also lead to increased academic achievement. Furthermore, a rich sports program can promote cooperation and social responsibility, while a well-funded library supports the academic work of students. Lastly, although both are important for a student’s overall development, the stress on one at the expense of the other diminishes the importance of both physical and mental development. In the end, an equitable budget would encourage the development of well-rounded students ready for the challenges of life beyond the university.
1387;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;Today computers are used almost everywhere, it is impossible to imagine our life without PCs, Internet, mobile phones and other computer devices. It is reasonable to think that people look forward to the future of computers., computers make our life easier, we can easily get information about any product we plan to buy or place we plan to visit in a second using a personal computer and . Scientists predict that in the nearest future it will be possible to smell a new perfume using the Internet and watch 3D scenes at home like we do in the movie theater. According to forecasts of HR agencies machines will replace jobs of cashiers, and civil and military pilots. Some corporations in Japan are already sellinghousewife-robots, which help old people to keep their homes clean.Despite the fact that computers help us, they make us dependent. Apparently, people spend more time behind monitors than ever before. And some of them feel a need for more time to be spent with people in live contact. In addition, a breakdown of one of the important modules of a specific computer can entail serious consequences. to mention the computer problem that occurred in the end of 1990s, a problem related to the coming year 2000 (Y2K) and catastrophes that were predicted. Fortunately imminent disasters did not happen. However, it is difficult to imagine what could if all the predictions came true.We live in a technological era, computers penetrated everywhere with all benefits they provide and all dangers they hide. However we are satisfied with them and sometimes we even thank them because they help us in communicating, studying, doing business, entertaining and saving lives in critical situations.; Is it likely that we will not use them at all in future? In business they are used for automation, data analysis and communication. In crime detection, they are used to analyze patterns, predict crime and help in investigations. We are becoming more and more dependent on computers, and this is changing our lives in many ways. In future, we can look forward to the development of “smart cities” where computer technology controls the flow of traffic, energy consumption and waste disposal, leading to more efficient urban living. In the aviation industry, they control flight plans, navigation and even autopilot. Furthermore, with the increasing integration of artificial intelligence into everyday devices, it is expected that we will soon have homes that learn our preferences and carry out routine tasks for us. Although all these developments offer enormous benefits, we should approach our dependence on computers with caution. A number of important questions are now being raised, such as the role of bias in decision-making in the criminal justice system and the security of our personal data. The automation that creates the opportunity for greater productivity is also likely to result in unemployment, raising important questions about the economy and society. In future, we must find a balance between embracing new developments and addressing the challenges they raise, to ensure that technology serves humanity without compromising our values and security. Despite the many benefits of our growing dependence on computers, such as increased efficiency and new capabilities, we should remain wary of a complete reliance on technology.
1396;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in the future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;In the last two decades cybernetics have experienced a major breakthrough .This led to the utilization of computers in nearly all parts of our daily life, from personal computers to the ones performing complicated surgeries. Surely the uptake of this technology facilitates a lot of difficult tasks but is this excessive ripping the warmth out of our lives? .Most of the daily tasks individual experiences are time and effort consuming. These two qualities could be tremendously saved by the use of computers. The average period required to prepare a decent meal for a middle-class family is around an hour to hour and a half when using traditional methods. This time could be literally reduced to half if computerized are used instead. Moreover, a busy businessman is enabled to easily close a profitable deal with just a touch highly programmed laptop while enjoying his family vacation and not having to exert an extra effort of traveling long distances in order to a deal.On the other hand, new generations are growing remarkably dependent on these modern utilities, which makes them handicapped when it comes to a cup of tea. , psychologists suggest that one of the main reasons for rate increase is the recent electric inventions. This is due to the fact that humans by nature stay emotionally healthy through socializing, but due to the importance of modern technology to maintain a financially satisfying standard of life they gradually themselves. As time passes by each of these individuals gets stuck in a vicious circle of loneliness that eventually leads to suicidal attempts especially among youngsters.In conclusion, similarly to every other invention computers have their benefits and drawbacks, I personally think it all depends upon how we use the given tools . Moderation is the key here to keep the balance and allow us to live in harmony.; The future of computers is both exhilarating and frightening. In the future, they will not only be used for complex calculations, but also as emotional support for human beings. The same goes for a wide range of educational institutions. In addition, we can expect them to become increasingly integrated into our private lives, in the form of smart homes with smarter artificial intelligence that will take care of energy consumption, security and health checks and thus make our life more convenient. In spite of these benefits, the increased reliance on the computer requires us to be more critical of their benefits. As we delegate more and more decision-making power to the algorithm and the artificial intelligence, we risk increasing the possibility of errors and biases inherent in these systems. In addition, the benefits of the convenience of the technology often come at the cost of a reduction in our personal skills. When we use a navigation system, we often lose our orientation and our geographical knowledge. In conclusion, while the future promises an even better use of the computer in terms of efficiency and quality of life, it also demands that we be more cautious about it. Another threatening aspect of our dependence on technology is the possibility of a data breach or misuse. With the accumulation of so much personal information, the threat of cybercrime is becoming more and more dangerous. And so we must be more skeptical of our dependence on the computer in order to use it in a responsible manner and preserve our humanity. Embracing their benefits and innovations does not mean renouncing critical thinking and human control.
1356;What are the difficulties of learning a foreign language, and how to overcome them?;Many people believe that learning a foreign language is a very difficult task. What are the most difficult things about learning a foreign language? What is the best way to overcome them? Explain and include your personal experience or knowledge of these problems.It is true that acquiring new language skills is by no means an easy task. Language learners might encounter several challenges such as unfamiliar accents or grammar structures a foreign language. However, in my opinion, such difficulties can be tackled by a well-rounded education system.When it comes to languages, it is undeniably crucial to get used to a native accent and intonation for effective communication. However, picking up an accurate accent can be enormously difficult, especially for adult learners because of their lack of language learning ability. If a language learner has an unrecognisable accent and intonation, they would not be understood by native speakers. On top of that, each language has different grammar and typical grammatical sequencing of words. For example, Korean sentences always end with verbs whilst English not, which means that a Korean English-learner should the correct order of words.Despite the aforementioned difficulties, I strongly believe that everyone can master a foreign language when a couple of feasible steps are taken. Firstly, it is more important than anything to start learning a new language at a young age. By incorporating foreign language programmes in the primary school curriculum, children can easily be exposed to languages of the world and eventually acquire language skills without difficulties. Secondly, the government can financially subsidise schools to run student exchange programmes that help adolescents to get experiences abroad and make friends overseas while improving their foreign language in a way.In conclusion, I believe that individuals can have difficulties in learning a new language because of different accents and unfamiliar grammar, however, these problems can be overcome by a good quality of education system subsidised by governments.The writer covered the task by talking about some difficult aspects of learning a new language and steps to overcome them. The ideas are presented in an orderly way, their logical sequencing and the use of paragraphing make this essay easy to follow. Skillful use of linking words and expressions helps the writer maintain coherence and cohesion. Word choice needs some more attention in this essay (see suggested corrections for expressions underlined in blue), however, overall this essay seems to be worthy of IELTS Band 8.; Understand the difficulties and the strategies of overcoming them will greatly facilitate the study of a foreign language. Learning a foreign language is a very enriching experience that opens up many new cultures, ideas, and opportunities. One of the main difficulties in learning a foreign language is the complexity of grammar and syntax. Each language has its own grammar rules, and they may differ significantly from the rules of the mother tongue. For example, the case system of German and Russian is extremely difficult to learn. In addition, vocabulary acquisition is a big challenge. Many students have difficulty learning new words, which makes them feel frustrated and depressed. To overcome this difficulty, you can use a method of gradual learning, breaking down the rules of the language into small parts, and practicing regularly. Another major difficulty is the lack of opportunities to practice speaking and listening. One of the effective ways to overcome this difficulty is to use mnemonics. Mnemonics is a kind of learning method that associates new words with images, uses flash cards, and makes use of spaced repetition. Similarly, regular conversation partners, chats and language learning clubs can also be used to overcome this difficulty. The key to learning a foreign language is that it is best to practice as much as possible with native speakers. Also, there is a psychological barrier to learning a foreign language. Many people are afraid to make mistakes, which inhibits their willingness to learn. Having a growth mindset and accepting mistakes as part of the learning process can be very useful. In conclusion, although there are many difficulties in learning a foreign language, a strategic approach to learning grammar, using effective learning methods, taking regular practice opportunities, and adopting a growth mindset can facilitate the study of foreign languages and make it a fun experience. It is also useful to join supportive communities, whether they are online or in real life.
1348;When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers (agree/disagree);When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers for people to spend their free time. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Sample EssaySome people argue that town planners should have a preference for more parks and gyms to be created than business districts and shopping malls. While I understand the concerns of people who hold this opinion, it seems to me that shopping centers are just as important as parks and gyms in a town.There are reasons why public facilities are crucial to city inhabitants. First of all, they provide suitable spaces and equipment for people to exercise. For example, people can go jogging in the park and play tennis or basketball at the sports stadium. That helps to keep their bodies fit and it also elevates their mood during the day. Besides, parks and sports facilities are good spots for people to socialize with their neighbors. People can connect with others when they are playing sports or talking casually with passers by in the park. A harmonious relationship between residents helps build a caring and friendly neighborhood.Although parks and gyms give the town dwellers all kinds of benefits, I would like to point out the importance of shopping malls to the district. Firstly, a shopping center could make shopping more convenient for the local residents. It would enable them to easily purchase things in town and transport them home with less effort and at lower cost. They would not need to spend extra money on transportation or shipping of the goods. Secondly, a shopping mall can provide employment. Locals can find work in retail, maintenance or security of the mall, hence earning an income to support their families.In conclusion, although parks and sports facilities serve as places for exercise and social activities for city dwellers, I believe that shopping centers are equally important, since they can provide job opportunities and convenience to the town residents.This essay would score well on Task Achievement because it addresses all parts of the question, discusses reasons for and against building more parks than shopping malls and expresses the opinion of the writer. The main ideas are organized well and explained coherently. The range of vocabulary is adequate for the requirements of the task response. Overall, this essay could get Band 8 in IELTS.; It is my view that a balance must be struck between public parks and sports facilities and commercial facilities in the planning of new towns. The reasons are as follows: Firstly, the parks and sports facilities have an important role in promoting physical health and fitness. For instance, a town with a large number of parks and playgrounds enables its residents to have regular contact with nature, thus reducing stress and enhancing their physical and mental health. As a result, they will have better quality of life and a longer life expectancy. In addition, the parks are also the meeting places of residents and provide opportunities for them to meet and talk to each other. This means a stronger community feeling, which is not easy to build up in shopping centers. While shopping centers are of importance for the economy of the town, too much of them may result in congestion and a waste of open space, which may compromise the long-term sustainability of the town. The importance of such common areas should be emphasized in the planning of new towns, so that they can be a place where different people can meet and live together. Therefore, it is my view that the parks and sports facilities should be given more emphasis in the planning of new towns than shopping centers.
47;While many people go to university for academic study, more people should be encouraged to do vocational training because there is a lack of qualified workers such as electricians and plumbers. Do you agree or disagree?;Some believe that people should be encouraged more to study practical courses than going to university to fulfill the lack of workforce in practical areas. I agree with this proposal to some degree, because, from my knowledge, there is a lack in both fields, academic and vocational experts. Moreover, academic studies and vocational ones are equally important for every society, and not everybody can study the same thing, so both studies should be encouraged.Qualified workers and professional academics are equally needed in many parts of the world. This is because as the population grows the people's needs do it too, and this happens in all shapes and areas. While living in Argentina, I noticed the need of professionals in fields such as medicine and technology, especially robotics. In England, however, I observed the lack of plumers and carpenters. Consequently, every country needs different things.Furthermore, if strong encouragement is put on studying vocational courses only, this could be detrimental to the academic field. Essentially, both study systems are equally important. A hospital needs doctors to treat people as well as electricians to maintain the building. Besides, not everybody is good at everything. Some might be good at performing practical tasks and some good at thinking. In my family, I am the one who studied at the university, but my sister studied dressmaking. Both of us have jobs nowadays.In conclusion, I believe that the two types of studies should be stimulated. Countries worldwide are in lack of different experts, either in the vocational or academic field, hence, both workers are equally essential and needed. Besides and more importantly, not every individual can study the same subject or perform in the same area.; The above statement is true to a certain extent. However, I am convinced that vocational training should be encouraged and emphasized more. Today, in a modern society, vocational training is often neglected and largely forgotten. With the ever-increasing costs of university studies, vocational training offers a more financially viable alternative to many students. Vocational education and training offer a practical approach to learning, teaching the specific skills needed for various professions, and are generally shorter than university courses, so people can enter the workforce more quickly and often without being indebted to the university. Besides, there is a lack of qualified workers in various industries, for example, electricians and plumbers, so that projects are often delayed due to a lack of qualified people. In addition, having hands-on experience in vocational courses often leads to a faster job offer, because employers are constantly looking for qualified people to fill the shortages in the labor market. . It should therefore be encouraged and promoted more so that essential trades are well staffed and thus ensure a stable and sustainable economy. A commitment to vocational training strengthens both the individual and society.
1380;Why do criminals commit another offence after being punished?;"Many offenders commit more crimes after serving the first punishment. Why is this happening, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?It is true that some criminals commit crimes again after they have been punished. While there are several reasons for this alarming trend, some effective measures can be taken by governments to tackle this problem.There are two main reasons for re-offenders. Firstly, the prison system can make the situation worse. Criminals put together in prison and they make friends with other offenders. While they are locked up in prison, they do not have much to do there, and they would exchange information about what they have done before they came to the prison or they may plan crimes with other inmates. Secondly, offenders often do not have any other means of earning money. They are poor, uneducated and lacking skills needed to maintain a job. Also, a criminal record makes finding a job difficult as people usually avoid hiring .To solve this problem, governments should focus on rehabilitation of criminals rather than punishment. Above all, prisons need vocational training which inmates to prepare for life outside the prison. They can learn practical skills such as computer programming, car maintenance and graphic design. In this way, they can be hired for a position that requires this certain knowledge and skills. Community service is another way to reform offenders. Rather than being locked up in prison with other inmates, offenders can help society and become useful to their local community, and these activities would eliminate the negative influence that prisons can have.In conclusion, it is true the one of the problems our community; it can be solved by focusing rather than punishment itself.This is a good essay. The requirements of the task statement are covered, the reasoning is logical and presented in a coherent, easy to follow way, the range of vocabulary is wide enough and the writer shows fluency and flexibility. Some minor errors in this essay include word choice and preposition errors (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows suggested corrections). Overall this looks like an IELTS Band 8 essay."; One of the main reasons for the criminals to commit another offence after they have been punished is that the criminal justice system has not been properly able to deal with the root causes of crime. The phenomenon of recidivism, in which people who have already committed crimes continue to commit them, is multi-factorial and influenced by many psychological, social and economic factors. Instead of developing responsibility and personal development, it can strengthen the criminal identity. After the imprisonment, they are in need of support and life skills and are more vulnerable to the re-offense. They feel they have been discriminated against in the field of employment, housing and social relations, which in turn increases the sense of loneliness and hopelessness. This also encourages them to seek emotional satisfaction, social belonging and financial stability in an environment they are already familiar with, although illegal. In short, the recidivism cycle is a result of insufficient rehabilitation and the lack of proper treatment for mental illness. The psychological factors, such as drug addiction and mental illness, are very common in criminals. If these underlying causes are not properly dealt with in prison or after the release, they may re-offend to cope with these feelings or to cover the costs of their addiction. By understanding and dealing with these factors, the cycle of re-offending can be broken. A new way of thinking, emphasizing rehabilitation, support and integration into society, can help reduce the recidivism rate and create a safer society.
1400;With all the problems in the world today, spending money on space exploration is a complete waste. The money could be better spent on other causes.;, every day, every year, celebrates its achievements in space exploration. However, it is now the time to question how meaningful these blasts are.First, until all urgent and important matters of the globe have been solved, money on space exploration is meaningless. It at all to invest millions of dollars researching and producing foods for astronauts (for space exploration purpose), while every day thousands of people are starving. Furthermore, the discovery of outer space only serves a minor group of people if the majority well-educated. do no even know how to prevent common threatening diseases such as AIDS and lung cancer.Then, some may argue that the purpose of space exploration to discover new lands, new energy resources or to deter potential threat to . Nevertheless, is it effective to do so while other alternatives are available? yet effectively used. New energy resources (e.g. solar and nuclear energy) have not yet been widely-used. Threats of plagues have not yet been deterred. All of these tasks that haven’t been tackled yet require money. That is why costly space discovery programs are a waste of resources.In a nutshell, people should only invest in space exploration provided that urgent and important matters mentioned earlier in this essay have been solved. Also, purposes of space exploration campaigns should be studied carefully and other alternatives should be considered before the money is wasted.; Those who are against space travel argue that the billions of dollars spent on NASA and other space programs would be better spent on poverty, the climate, and health. Given all the issues facing mankind, it is not surprising that many people see the colossal spending on space travel as a waste of money. For example, the money spent on space agencies could go towards education and health care for underdeveloped countries, thus creating an environment in which human potential can be used to the full. The most urgent problem is poverty, and billions of people around the world still do not have access to clean water, food and education. More immediate investment in health care, social services and sustainable development would reduce suffering and improve the quality of life for millions of people. While there are great scientific advances being made in planetary exploration, the planet itself is in danger from man-made activities that are causing huge changes in weather conditions, loss of biodiversity, and rising sea levels. Developing sustainable energy and protecting the environment are therefore priorities for governments. The resources spent on space agencies should be reallocated to areas where the needs are immediate and pressing. While space exploration is a source of innovation and could lead to technological advances that benefit mankind, its benefits are often intangible and do not stand up to the more immediate and tangible problems that mankind faces today.
1312;With the increase in computer use, many people feel that schools do not need to put the emphasis that they used to on basic handwriting skills or mental mathematics skills.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;In recent years, computer use around the world has increased drastically. As a result technological equipment is used increasingly in schools around the world. Many people question therefore whether schools should put much emphasis on teaching students basic handwriting skills and mental mathematics skills.The use of technological equipment in lessons has increased since the onset of the digital age. Nearly all professions around the world involve computer use and even the simplest tasks are carried out via electronic equipment. Hence, it is important for students to learn how to use technology correctly for their future careers. Electronic devices also offer various learning advantages, as notes and assignments can be completed much faster and more neatly using these tools.Nonetheless, the practical skills such as using and holding a pen correctly are likewise vital for future careers. For that reason, students have to be taught at early ages how to carry out simple tasks using basic skills, such as writing. It is also essential that a student develops neat handwriting, as in the case of a technological problem the student will have to write by hand. Furthermore, final exams are typically written by hand and thus the student must develop the basic skill of holding a pen and writing with it. Mathematics skills are no different. People will not always have a device with them to carry out calculations and the ability to do arithmetic in the head is a vital skill for operating in today’s world.In conclusion, I personally believe that schools should keep a balance between using practical skills and using electronic equipment to carry out certain tasks by having student submit assignments created electronically, yet also by having them complete assignments by hand in class and without computers or calculators. This balance is important, as if the focus lies only on one of the two aspects, the student will face problems later on in life.; In this essay I will argue that although the use of computers and learning materials has a great influence on the school environment, handwriting and mental arithmetic should still be taught in schools because they are fundamental to personal development and the expression of one’s personality. First of all, handwriting is an essential means of communication. When we take notes in a class, the students who take handwritten notes often retain more of the material because they have to process the information more slowly. Recent research has shown that handwriting activates brain areas that are involved in thinking and memory. Furthermore, in this digital world, writing by hand is still needed for many purposes such as handwritten notes, signatures, and thank you letters. Likewise, mental arithmetic is an important tool for life and not just a way to do arithmetic problems. Mental arithmetic develops the basic problem-solving and critical thinking skills that are necessary for everyday life. Although calculators are common, the ability to calculate mentally is essential for budgeting, cooking, and shopping. For these reasons, a combination of traditional and modern approaches to learning is desirable in schools.
1303;With the scale of globalisation today, it would be of unquestioned benefit to have a single world currency.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Globalisation has become a significant aspect of the world’s modern economy, with countless industries and businesses expanding in various countries. This has led to the debate of developing a world currency with many people believing it could drastically help further develop economies and assist in the development of many countries.A worldwide currency could bring on effects similar to when Euro was developed for Europe. Trade could be significantly encouraged, as there would be no exchange rate fluctuation risks between different currencies. Moreover, tourists would not need to exchange money when travelling.However, there are certain risks to a global currency, which definitely do not make it an “unquestioned benefit”. Countries in debt would not be able to lower their currency value to make consumer goods more desirable, which could develop into a severe economic issue. For example, the US regulated its interest rates to increase the money resources in order to diminish the effect of a recent recession. Also economic problems, such as in Greece, have actually been made worse by the use of the common Euro. If applied worldwide, many countries’ economies could be very similarly negatively impacted. Finally, many countries around the world do not have a stable enough economy to be able to enter a common currency. If weaker countries were to adopt a world currency, this could be disastrous to their economy and to the economies of other countries using the same currency.In conclusion, the extent to which a global currency would be beneficial is quite low. It seems to me that the risks outweigh the benefits, as if a country were to lose economic stability, the world would be impacted as well. For that reason, I feel that in present circumstances, it is best to have separate currencies to protect countries from economic recession.; Speak about this issue. The growing economic interdependence of modern countries has led to a lively debate about the advantages and disadvantages of a single world currency. The advantages, of course, are that it would simplify international trade, reduce transaction costs and prevent fluctuations in the value of currencies. But the disadvantages include loss of national sovereignty and a degree of economic instability. One significant advantage of a single world currency is the simplification of international business transactions. Business would no longer need to deal with complex currency issues, which would make business operations simpler and faster. While I acknowledge the advantages of a single world currency, I believe that the disadvantages would outweigh the benefits. Some of the advantages are already in evidence in the European Union, where a single currency has reduced transaction costs and increased the volume of trade. But a single world currency would also bring significant problems. For example, companies that export products would have fewer obstacles to overcome, which would lower prices for consumers and boost the economy. If the world economy were to experience a downturn, countries might want to devalue their currency to increase their exports. Under a single world currency, this would no longer be possible. Perhaps the greatest danger of a single world currency is the loss of national control over monetary policy. This would have long-term negative consequences. In conclusion, while a single world currency would certainly have advantages in an increasingly integrated global economy, there are also many disadvantages, especially in the loss of national sovereignty and the loss of control over monetary policy. The economic disparity between countries would also lead to problems in resource allocation and the decision-making process.
1295;With the vast increase in online resources today, libraries with print books are not a necessity for today’s society.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is indeed true that digital resources today far outstrip what can be put and stored in print books. Almost any kind of book can now be accessed digitally and those that can’t be will soon be changed to a digital format. Some people, therefore, believe that libraries with print books are no longer needed.If one looks at this issue dispassionately, it seems far more logical that people now should only read books digitally. It only requires a single computer or electronic reader and an individual can have access to the history of literature and works on all other fields. The costs involved with setting, typing, printing and distributing print books would practically disappear and this would make things more convenient and much cheaper. An actual library building would be totally unnecessary, as all one would need would be a ‘virtual library’ as a website and all works could be accessed through this portal. There would not even be any need to leave the house to gain access to anything one needed. This would seem to be the most logical way of proceeding.Logic, however, is not always the best approach to everything. Print books have a long history with humanity and our relationship with real books is not something that can be changed overnight. Many people, including younger readers, feel that there is something special about having a book with real paper and needing to turn pages. There will therefore for the time being be a future for print books and libraries.Libraries will continue to be especially important, as not all older people use computers and e-readers as much as the younger generation. They will still want to read print books and the library is a cheap and convenient place to find them. In addition, if only a few books in print are available in the future, libraries might be one of the few places where they might be accessed. Another purpose that libraries serve is acting as community centres that organise events, education and childcare. Ironically, libraries also provide computers and Internet access for people who cannot afford their own.In spite of the seeming dominance to come of digital books, I feel that there is and will be a place for libraries with print books. This state of affairs might change in the future, but at present, they are important community resources.; You should write at least 250 words. To begin with, libraries provide much more than books, they are community centers, providing a place for people to work together, share ideas and exchange culture. The digital age has made it easy to access the world's information, and people are now arguing about the need for print libraries. There are many benefits to going to a library, not just for reading, but also for studying, doing research and working together. There are many students who say that a quiet and peaceful library is a better place to study than their own homes. Librarians provide valuable information and resources that are often not available on the Internet. This is especially true for academic research and academic writing, which requires accuracy and consistency. Also, some people have access to the Internet and some do not, and some people rely on libraries to get the Internet and learn digital literacy, which can help to bridge the digital gap and make sure that everyone can participate in the digital world. The library is an important place for learning, understanding and sharing. It should not be ignored or considered obsolete.
1392;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Capital punishment is always associated with ignorance and intolerance. In fact, we must acknowledge that some people disagree with this kind of penalty, but others vote in its favor. Portugal was the first European country to end this kind of penalty. Since the 19th century, tolerance and respect for life important values. Moreover, we can affirm that remains under the same codes. Maybe because of a religious view point, the respect for life is a typical value in the Old Catholic world.Those who are in favor of capital punishment mostly live in developing countries. However, this is not just an image of the Third World countries. Actually, the USA is one country where this kind of punishment has its rates of application. The state of Texas, in particular, is at the top, supporting this measure against crime, especially those involving serial killers and crimes against children. In a society dominated by fear and government control, it is foreseen that this penalty will continue .Maybe this is not a simple question. As we can see there are several values here and of course cultural behavior. The roots of the question are religious, cultural, ethical and even geographical. The world is divided and the law systems show this division. The solutions, however can lead us to other questions concerning revenge and justice. better to kill a person because of his crimes? Can we admit that a life sentence could be a much better sentence? In fact, rehabilitation is the right way especially with an accurate psychological evaluation first. Some people are lost forever, and in my opinion some murderers and other criminals will suffer more in jail. In this sense, capital punishment is an easy way out.; Proponents of the death penalty argue that the death penalty is a deterrent against crimes of violence and that the knowledge that there is a high price to pay for crime may deter criminals from committing crimes. The debate over capital punishment is complicated and very controversial and there are strong arguments on both sides. However, many studies have shown that abolishing the death penalty does not necessarily increase the number of violent crimes in a country. On the contrary, there is much evidence that factors such as socio-economic factors, education and participation in civil life have a much stronger influence on crime rates. There is also a fundamental problem with the impossibility of executing innocent people, not to mention that a judicial error can lead to the death penalty. The argument that capital punishment is essential for maintaining security overlooks these many factors. Instead of capital punishment, other options such as life imprisonment with the possibility of rehabilitation offer better protection for society. The risk of executing an innocent person is great and cannot be ignored. The risk of taking a life irrevocably because of insufficient evidence or unjust proceedings can also undermine public confidence in the legal system. In conclusion, although the death penalty is an attempt to provide a certain level of security, the evidence for this is ambiguous and the results cannot be drawn from any studies. A comprehensive approach to crime prevention, based on socio-economic factors, is more likely to make a safer society. Moreover, this approach is more in line with the values of humanism and fairness, which should be the basic foundation of civilized society. I therefore disagree that capital punishment is necessary for the prevention of violence in society.
1430;Without capital punishment our lives are less secure and crimes or violence increase. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Serious crimes need capital punishment so that the are unable to get involved in the crime in the future. However, they want to stop the acts of violation in the future then it would be better to .Overall, I agree with the fact that punishment is the way to avoid the and hence our lives become more secure. If the wrongdoer wants to be a good and there is a particular financial or personal problem that led him to the wrong way, then it would be the nice option to forgive him and try to solve the problem he . Although by this way, some bad may become effective of the society but some do not bring themselves to the right path because they are . The person that involved in the crime and never to stop the law-breaking act should be punished in extremely serious way. However, it totally depends on the nature of crime. Some to a capital punishment and some may require a small penalty. The law-making institutions are responsible to bring the bad man to the right level of punishment that he deserves. If there is weak legislation to properly handle the offender, it may for the good . The government should be the responsible authority to provide a secure and better state to live. Laws should be implemented and executed in the most proper way that not allow the offender to commit violent acts or to break the law in any way and to any extent. To sum up, it is the responsibility of the state to stop people involved in crime. It may be done through solving the problems of the people that led them to commit that act or by the punishment accordingly.Where are the paragraphs? This is a good essay; however there are many small mistakes that might cost you dearly. There are also several unclear expressions and grammatical errors."; In my opinion, the relationship between capital punishment and crime is a complex and complicated relationship, and I do not fully agree with the statement that the abolition of capital punishment would necessarily lead to the decrease of our security. The debate on capital punishment is one of the most controversial issues in the criminal justice system. Many studies have shown that crime rates are more strongly influenced by a variety of social, economic, and psychological factors than by whether capital punishment is imposed or abolished. Supporters of capital punishment often claim that the threat of execution prevents potential offenders from committing heinous crimes. The basis for this belief is that a person is more likely to think about the consequences of his actions when he knows that death awaits him. However, it is a well-known fact that the possibility of an innocent person being executed is a very strong moral question that should not be ignored. On the other hand, countries with low capital punishment are often at least as safe or even safer than those with high rates of capital punishment, which suggests that other factors, such as poverty, education and effective policing, are more important for public safety than the death penalty. I think that if we want to achieve a society where criminals are given the opportunity to rehabilitate and be a positive part of the community, we have to turn our focus away from the death penalty. Capital punishment is irreversible, so any mistakes in the process of administering justice could lead to the tragic loss of an innocent life and would thus inevitably weaken the foundation of the justice of the law. In a more comprehensive approach to crime, social reform and rehabilitation should be the main priority, rather than the threat of death. A system of justice that focuses on the prevention and rehabilitation of criminals could lead to a safer society in the long run.
163;Write about the following topic.Although there are a lot of translation software available, learning a language could still be advantageous. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people claim that language knowledge has still benefited inspite of appearance of applications and websites providing translation in real time. Modern special software is able to give quite quality translation into different languages, and it seems that it will soon replace the translators and will get rid of necessity to learn new languages. However, in my opinion, there are still some essential advantages to know foreign languages.First of all, any language is so complicated and constantly changing system that it is impossible to automized translation process to keep all senses. For instance, if you interlocutor creates a joke based on words game, it will unlikely recognise by AI. Thus, it is too hard to teach a computer to uderstand all meanings that you want to provide.Another important aspect of learning languages is knowing new cultures. Language is the great source for understanding other nations and countries. If you use online translator, you will never know the origine of some idioms or phrases that contain culture code.Moreover, learning new language is a tool of training your brain. It helps to develop memory and imagination. For instance, people didn't refuse studying maths after calculation device had been invented, because it is still important to understand how it works and it is necessary for developing other sciences.Finally, there is a lot of places and occasions when you do not have internet access. Then online translators are not available. But if you need help or ask a path being abroad, it is better to know at least some phrases. Otherwise, you can occur in unpleasant situation.To sum up, I definitely agree the statement that learning languages is essential in spite of techology progress. Although artificial intelligence is able to translate everything you want, it is crucial to continue learning languages in order to understand all sense and meanings in conversation with foreigners, to know new cultures and understand their peculiarities and, of course, to make your brain work.; It is easy to use translation tools to help overcome language barriers. In a world that is becoming more globalized, these translation tools have become essential. But even though they are very convenient, they are not as beneficial as learning a language. People who are familiar with a foreign language have a much richer experience of life and work abroad. A language is not only a collection of words, it is also a combination of history, customs and beliefs. You can't really understand the nuances of social behavior in Spanish, or appreciate the beauty of Italian poetry, just by using a translation tool. Learning a language such as Mandarin, which has a unique tone and character, can make your brain stronger. There have been studies that show that people who are familiar with more languages are more flexible in thinking and more able to solve problems. And when it comes to jobs, there are many careers that need people to speak more than one language. If you don't want to use a translation tool, your thinking will become superficial. But if you want to understand a culture deeply, you can have a better job. For example, a marketing expert who knows the language and culture of the local area can create a more successful marketing strategy, but this is not possible for a translation tool. A language is a useful pursuit in a world that is becoming more and more unified.

Why are more people choosing to have operation to change the way they look? Do you think this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;A greater number of individuals opted for plastic surgery to enhance the physical outlook. What could be the reason behind the increasing number of people opting for cosmetic surgery to deter their appearance.In my opinion the main reason why cosmetic surgery is in demand nowadays is because society has set a certain standard that physical appearance will be the fastest ticket to stand out in the crowd. Second is it boosts confidence to people with low self esteem.The favorable outcome is not as much the adverse effect to the individuals. Example, the fastest way to reduce wrinkles on the face is to get Botox treatment. It lasts 3-4 months, after that it needs continuous medication to maintain what has been changed. It takes a lot of money to satisfy the demands of the society. On top of that repetition of pain and recovery during and after the surgery.There are numerous natural ways to enhance beauty and confidence. Contentment, exercise and a healthy lifestyle are effective methods to maintain the genuine beauty of the people. Simple walking in the morning, keeping the distance from negativity and eating vegetables and fruits are the simplest methods that boost the natural glow of the body and prevent us from being sick.To conclude the essay, I think plastic surgery is not necessary to enhance physical outlook as it uses synthetic components that have harmful effects within the body.; One of the reasons why people have been increasingly keen on the idea of cosmetic surgery is the unrelenting pressure of society to conform to beauty standards. This trend has several causes, including social pressure, the influence of the media and the search for self-esteem and self-confidence. In addition, if one is to believe the analysis of the American study on cosmetic surgery, this trend is likely to be driven by a desire to be beautiful, because in society’s view of beauty, beauty is defined very narrowly. With the popularization of media and the increasing popularity of these ideals, people, especially young people, find themselves unable to cope with the social pressure to have their bodies match these narrow criteria. Moreover, the role of social media is becoming more and more important. Social media like Instagram and Snapchat have created an environment where the beauty of the filtered and altered images reigns, and people are constantly exposed to the beauty of these images, and this exposure leads to a constant comparison of the self and the other. The result of successful cosmetic surgery is that people's confidence is increased and their quality of life is improved. For example, a person who had a nose and had long been self-conscious about it can be confident after a rhinoplasty. On the other hand, the desire to improve one's appearance may be a personal choice, but it is also a mental health issue. One of the risks of cosmetic surgery is the possibility of developing body dysmorphia. This can lead to people being dissatisfied with their appearance even after surgery. However, on the negative side, the surgery can cause people to have a dissatisfaction with their bodies that can be detrimental to their mental health.

What solutions can you suggest?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Most children are facing one form of bullying or the other in our schools on daily basis world wide. It is becoming a serious problem and there is a need to solve this. In this essay, we would be considering two causes and possible ways to solve these.First of all, the rate at which children bullying each other in the school environment is rising. One major cause is that bullying breeds bullying, children who are faced with physical, mental and emotional abuse from homes tend to transfer their fustrations on their peers. They think that is how one is supposed to live, exacting authority to gain superiority on weaker peers in school. Another is children who has low self esteem, such students feels threatened over their classmates they taught to be more intelligent or having better physical appearance than them.Although, there are several causes of bullying, teachers should be taught how to identify children who are from abusive homes and inform the appropriate authority. These students would taken away from such toxic environment early and they would be sent for some pschological therapy. Meanwhile, education is also a key factor especially for children who have low self esteem. This should be done by forms such as role plays, presentation and drama, where these students are taught how to have self love and accepting what they can not change on their self.In conclusion, children from abusive homes and those who have low self esteem are some of the reasons for bullying. I recommend that early identification of abusive children and education is some of the ways we can solve these problems.; You will have to use your own words, but you can use the text below as a guide. Bullying is a common problem in schools. There are several causes: One is the fact that students are often under pressure to conform to social norms, and this makes them behave in a certain way. Another reason is the fact that young people do not know the impact of their behavior on others, so they sometimes do harmful things without realizing the consequences. Besides, family relationships can also affect this. Children who see or experience violence at home often repeat this behavior at school, trying to establish dominance or power in social relations. To prevent bullying, schools should create comprehensive anti-bullying programs based on the development of empathy and respect between students. It also happens that the development of technology and social media is associated with the spread of bullying, which reaches into virtual spaces and where the victim has no way to escape. Having clear procedures for reporting bullying and giving clear evidence that all bullying cases are serious also motivates students to report. Also, organizing peer mentors to help students who are bullied is very important. The main thing is education, so schools should organize workshops, discussions, and classes about the different aspects of being different and about the consequences of bullying. School life becomes safer and safer, and students are given opportunities to develop their full potential. Encouraging students to stand up to bullying and promoting supportive friendships can also create a school environment where bullying does not occur.

But before looking at the advantages, we must consider the disadvantages. For example, buying groceries on the Internet allows you to save time and avoid crowds in the store. This is especially convenient for people with limited mobility and time. Another advantage is the wide choice of goods available. People can find more goods on the Internet than in shops, and therefore make more informed purchases. Moreover, the ability to compare prices across various sites makes it possible to find the best deals and save even more money. One of the main disadvantages of shopping on the Internet is the inability to touch and feel the product before buying it. For example, when buying books on the Amazon site, it is possible to find rare and old editions. It is also possible to be disappointed with the quality of the goods, especially with clothes. Moreover, shipping costs and long delivery times may deter some consumers, especially when express delivery is not available. Finally, a decline in local businesses harms the economy of local communities and employment. People should think carefully about whether the convenience of buying goods on the Internet outweighs the disadvantages. Another important disadvantage is the impact of delivery services on the environment, mainly in the form of excessive packaging and carbon emissions.
515;Write about the following topic.Cohabitation is believed to bring huge advantages for young people since it enables them to fully understand each other before deciding to get married.Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many people believe it may be advisable for couples to live together before getting married, as it may lead to a smoother relationship after they have married.I tend to agree with such opinions, as I find the arguments that usually support them to be quite reasonable. For example, it is commonly said that people act differently when they are at home and when they are outside. People instinctively tend to be more relaxed and off-guard when at home, whereas in social situations they usually make an effort, even if unconsciously, to be more likable and to conceal the less agreeable aspects of their personality from others, even their partners. Because of this, it is usual to hear that one does not truly know someone until one has lived with that person.In extreme cases, cohabitation before marriage could even prevent couples from entering into a marriage that is bound to fail and will lead to unhappiness. Considering this possibility seems reasonable, as marriage is not only an emotional bond, but also a legal one, and undoing it is usually upsetting, time-consuming and costly.Another reason I find cohabitation before marriage to be a sensible choice is that, as minor disagreements and conflicts are usually inevitable during the first months of cohabitation, it is preferable to pass through that stage before getting married than to add such problems to a period which in itself can already be stressful, such as the few weeks before the ceremony and the weeks following.What I have said up to this point reflects my opinion, but it must be noted I did not put any of it into practice when I got married. Indeed, my wife and I decided to move in together only a few weeks before the ceremony. This decision was due to the fact that her family is quite old-fashioned, and moving in together before would undoubtedly have caused them pain, even if we had our reasons for doing so and they would have understood them. No degree of persuasion would have avoided or removed such pain. We found the long-term benefits of a stable and close relationship with her family to be more important than the discomfort of not moving in together, and we ultimately decided to do it only once the ceremony was planned.; Cohabitation has gained in popularity, especially among young people. It is argued that it gives young people a better understanding of each other before marriage, which can be a positive thing. It reveals new things about their habits and attitudes that they didn’t know before. In particular, sharing a household and a financial life together may reveal problems that were not obvious during courtship. In this way, a cohabitation gives an insight into the marriage, so the couple can make a better decision when they are thinking about it. Moreover, cohabitation teaches the couple to talk about their expectations and limits, to clarify their respective roles and responsibilities, to talk about their own needs and wishes. During cohabitation, such a kind of communication is often beneficial for a relationship. Moreover, it is argued that the view of marriage that a person has and the cultural or individual attitude to marriage can affect their view of cohabitation and, consequently, their decision to marry. But it should also be noted that cohabitation does not always guarantee a smooth transition to marriage. Cohabitation should be approached both enthusiastically and cautiously, according to the specificity of the relationship. In my opinion, a cohabitation between young people can be a significant advantage for them, but it does not prevent them from having misunderstandings, and they must be able to talk to each other and do the work necessary for a long and healthy relationship.

What measures can be taken to protect them?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;These days, consumers often suffer from the increase of numbers of advertisements conducted by competing companies. I believe that this fact has certain negative effects on consumers' working performance as well as their private space and time. In order to protect consumers, some proposals related to protecting their information and eliminating the number of advertisements are required.The increasing number of advertisements has a negative effect on the consumers. Firstly, their working perfomance can be reduced. Obivously, when a person is working, he cannot receive a large number of advertisements, process and response them. I know a researcher who receives a lot of advertising emails from certain banksand even some scientific journal while he require time to perform many research projects. This makes him feel uncomfortable when working, thereby reducing the research's quality. Secondly, the advertisements can affect on people private space and time. For examle, when they spend time on their family after a hard working day, or even when they are sleeping. This completyly affects on the consumers, in terms of both physical and mental health.For protecting consumers, certain methods need to be proposed. Firstly, it can be implied that the consumers' information is illegal used by many companies. Therefore, an imporvement of security method can allow us to protect consumers. Secondly, eliminating the number of advertisements performed by companies and eliminating the hours for companies send advertisements are required.In conclusion, the increasing numbers of advertisements leads to certain unwanted results for consumers, such as reducing their working performance as well as their private space and time. For protecting consumers, we need to protect their personal information and eliminate the number of advertisements.; Advertisements use various means, from emotional appeals to celebrity endorsements, to make their products appear necessary and desirable. The degree to which consumers are influenced by advertisements is considerable, affecting not only their purchasing decisions but also their way of seeing the world. An athletic shoe, for example, can be associated with excellence and athleticism by using an athlete as a testimonial. First, advertising aims to create brand loyalty. Through repetition and targeted marketing, companies succeed in making consumers associate their products with a particular feeling or way of life. In doing so, they create a powerful connection between the brand and the individual, which may lead to the individual choosing the brand that embodies his or her aspirations and aspirations. But the influence of advertising is not always positive. Some advertisements create unrealistic standards of beauty, success, or lifestyle, causing dissatisfaction and unhealthy comparisons among consumers. As a result, people may become susceptible to these advertisements and believe they are not worthy of happiness or self-esteem. It is important to prevent this from happening, especially for younger people, to introduce regulations that limit the use of misleading images and images for children and vulnerable groups. Addiction programs can also help prevent unhealthy obsessions and encourage more informed consumption decisions. Finally, while advertisements undoubtedly affect consumers, it is important to implement measures to protect them. By educating consumers in media literacy, they can be better able to critically analyze advertisements, understand the persuasive methods used, and better understand the true purpose of the company. Likewise, promoting ethics in advertising can help consumers make more informed decisions about consumption and help them make informed consumption decisions.

Some people think that the closure of local business will bring about the death of local communities.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;As the huge company extends their bussiness, the local markets is dimmished to local society. This essay explains why I disagree closure of local business will bring about the death of local communities with relevant examples.First, Big company drag the new residents. I believe major company make the local communities to flourish. My cusion lived in countryside for 30 years. Every time when I visited that place, that farm land still same during the a few decades. However, recently when I dropped by there I surprised with new tall building that newly built. My cusion told me once the big supermarkert open in this neighborhood, grasp many couples or familly to live here. Eventually, that rural place's population is surged.Someone thought giant grocery's product cheap price can not compete with local product, that make local place to close. I considered it is anachromism idea. Now the customer's purchasing value is totally diffrent with previous eras. Buyer start choose organic product and eco-friendlly or morality brand. If local stores have their own unique products, which are not replace with other, such as handmade cheese and unique taste of bread, local bussiness can compete with global chain markets.In conclusion, albeit famous company expands their sites every moments, the local community can be larger by new residents settled down near local region. Also, local bussiness have specialty, community can not dismissed; Conclusive. I think that the situation is complex and requires further analysis. On the one hand, the convenience, competitive prices and variety of products offered by the supermarket make many consumers prefer them. As a result, the number of visitors to the local business is reduced, which not only affects the local economy, but also reduces the social cohesion of the local community. The local business with high operating costs and low bargaining power of local suppliers often lack the opportunity to continue to operate. Fortunately, in some areas, there have been some countermeasures to the dominance of the superstore. In addition to the traditional grocery store, the market has become popular, and cooperatives and artisan boutiques have been established as a local business alternative. Then, the death of local communities is not inevitable. According to the experiences of some cities such as Portland and Asheville, for example, the local business not only supports the local economy, but also promotes social cohesion and participation. The future of local communities lies in the balance between convenience and the richness of local culture and local businesses. It is the responsibility of local communities to support local entrepreneurship and create an environment that encourages the development of local businesses.

This essay will talk about extreme sports giving my own opinion about the idea of banning this activities because of their risks.Practicing a sport is very important for the general health of a person; a lot of people choose to practice dangerous sports, like skiing, because of the adrenaline and the sensation that it brings to you. Sports of this type can help you to go over your fear and they will help you to see life from a different perspective.Anyway, the risks that an athlete will go through are many; every year the amount of people that have injuries or, sometimes die, because of this types of activities are numerous. Especially with skiing, a person should never go alone in places that don't have the right equipment to guarantee a safe experience; many times when practicing this types of sports, athletes from all over the world decide to go over their limit going to practice in zones that are known to be dangerous or unsafe and, in this cases, the possibility of something bad to happen is high.Personally, I think that when you want to practice or experiment a sport that is extreme you should take all the right prevention to make the experience as safe as possible to avoid any injuries. Practicing sports is important but it is also fundamental to try your best to avoid injuries when practicing it. This essay talked about extreme sports and their risk, giving my own opinion at the end."; First of all, extreme sports give participants a unique, uplifting experience. They give people an intense feeling of achievement. Despite the fact that there is some risk of injury, extreme sports should not be banned but rather regulated. Secondly, extreme sports are not dangerous if certain rules and regulations are followed. For example, skydiving, jumping out of a plane, gives many people a sense of euphoria, helps to overcome their fears and enjoy a great sense of freedom. Finally, extreme sports should not be banned but regulated and properly prepared for by the participants. The majority of injuries in extreme sports such as skiing are caused by negligence, lack of experience and lack of proper equipment. For example, most ski resorts in the world require their visitors to wear a helmet and give their visitors the opportunity to take a skiing course to minimize the risks. The participants in extreme sports are bound to go to unregulated places where the safety regulations are not in place. Banning extreme sports can have a bad effect on the people who love it. Therefore, extreme sports should not be banned, but rather safety awareness, proper training and regulations should be introduced so that the risks are minimized and people can still enjoy the thrills of extreme sports. In conclusion, although extreme sports are dangerous, they should not be banned, but rather regulations and awareness of safety issues should be introduced so that people can enjoy the thrills of extreme sports.
479;Write about the following topic.Few people devote time to hobbies nowadays. Say why you think this is the case and what effect this has on the individual and society in general.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Hobbies are recreational activities that are pursued away from one's school or work. They are meant to be an escape from the mundane and a way of keeping people sane and happy. Unfortunately, they have become almost a luxury in today's fast-paced world.Several reasons can account for this massive decrease in the pursuit of hobbies. One such reason is the fact that hobbies require time and money which are two very dear resources in today's world. Social sophistication and technological advancements have brought about changes in hobbies. What used to be called hobbies in the past are now considered obsolete and the new ones, including video games and virtual reality require financial commitment in their pursuit. Even if one has the money to pursue such, he or she would have to set aside time in his or her busy schedule to enjoy those hobbies. It is therefore no wonder that most people found to pursue hobbies today are either wealthy youth or comfortable pensioners.Secondly, lack of interest may be an important factor why people devote little to no time to hobbies. Most of the educated lot are taught from a tender age only to concentrate on their studies in order to secure a comfortable future for themselves. Such children are discouraged from enjoying anything away from anything extracurricular and therefore grow into hobby-less adults who work all day and do nothing else otherwise. This is seen in a lot of Ghanaian homes where doing anything other than studying after school is deemed a taboo. Consequently, many grow into adults with little humour or mirth.Moreover, many people get exhausted with school or work, which have become extremely intensive nowadays, as compared to the more laid back past. After a tiring day, most people like to crawl into their beds to catch a night-long rest only to return to their busy life the next day.This lack of hobby pursuit, though understandable, does the individual and society more harm than good. Many individuals today are being treated for one mental health or another. Hobbies are a good way to relax and destress through leisure and can go a long way to improve mental health. Its absence will only wreak havoc for the society, which will only consist of tired and apathetic individuals who could not care less about each other and their surroundings.In conclusion, it is important, albeit difficult, to pay attention to hobbies in order to improve the health and psyche of the individual and society as a whole. More effort should be geared at encouraging hobbies at school and at the work place.; A hobby is less popular in the fast-paced world of today, and a number of reasons are responsible for this decline. But mainly it is because of the increasingly popular and digitally driven activities. Many people are now much more inclined to spend hours playing games and browsing social media instead of drawing, gardening or playing an instrument. This way of spending time reduces the opportunities for self-expression and decreases the joy that can be experienced by devoting time to a hobby. For this reason, many people have a very hard time to get enough time to pursue hobbies. Another important factor in this development is the increased pressure on working life and the length of working hours. On the one hand, this trend is not beneficial to individuals and society in general. Not being able to pursue hobbies can lead to increased stress, reduced creativity, and a lack of satisfaction and dissatisfaction. For example, a friend who works in the financial sector finds that her work leaves her too tired and busy to devote time to photography, which means she loses opportunities for both relaxation and personal development. In short, the decline in the hobby decline is due to digital distractions and increased work demands. The loss of common activities, such as sports and craft groups, may weaken the social ties that help to create the feeling of community and well-being that is essential for well-being. This means that it is necessary to encourage a balance between work and leisure, both for the individual and for society. This trend has many consequences, not only for the individual's health and creativity, but also for the well-being of the community.
595;Write about the following topic.Group or team activities can teach more important skills for life than those activities which are done alone.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The topic of group work can be more beneficial for peoples' lives than person who tend to do some work alone or not is widely discussed across the globe. Personally, I think there are some good advantages team activities cause our life,and especially in business scenes more comfortable and productive.Initially, only one person's work is limited, compared with group activities. This means that working only one person will be able to cause some profits to some extent. On the other hand, group working will be more productive and efficient to make more sales figures. In addition, each person has a great ability. For example, some people have great communication skills and negotiations. Those people arethe most appropriate roles for sales. Furthermore, some people are good at analysing the group performance quality and making strategies. Those who are good at these activities are best for marketing team. As a result, they can focus on their strong points for work and they can divide and conquer the tasks with each other.Of course, some people are eager to work alone at their own relaxed pace and make a profit to some extent. This is less stressful they do not need to keep attention from other colleagues. But this means that they need to decide all tasks and take all responsibility. Sometimes it might be risky once they made a mistake and caused a huge deficit.Finally, there is no doubt that more than two heads are better than one. People can share their experiences and opinion to improve their group activities. If some people who are sensitive and feel pressure if some people meddle in too much. It is necessary to organize some rules that must be effective. For example, all people need to try to stay positive, avoid stating negative or swear words, and not deny one person's opinion straightforwardly and emotionally. Making a great atmosphere, saying positive words with each other, and including some humor, will lead to everyone's performance being more productive.; I strongly agree that participating in group or team activities teaches invaluable lessons that can significantly affect the success and personal growth of an individual. Group activities contribute to the development of the most important skills for life that individual pursuits cannot offer in the same way. In particular, teamwork helps to develop the ability to communicate with others. For example, a recent group assignment in my college course taught me to combine my own opinions with the opinions of others and thus strengthened our presentation and honed my ability to compromise and negotiate. Such experiences teach an individual to clearly express his ideas and see them from the perspective of others. As the captain of the debate team in my school, I experienced this myself. Moreover, group work helps develop leadership skills. When a team faces a challenge, its members have to work together to solve the problem, using their different approaches and perspectives. My own role as the captain of the debate team taught me how to motivate others, coordinate their opinions, and develop a common strategy, which are essential skills in any career. In my opinion, the ability to work with others and resolve the most complex problems is the key to success in personal and professional life. In contrast, individual activities can develop self-discipline and a sense of individuality, but they often lack the flexibility and openness of teamwork.
317;Write about the following topic.In many countries large amounts of foods are wasted. Why do you think people waste food in this way? What can be done to reduce the amount of food thrown away?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, many countries are confronted with the increasing amount of waste and one of the major contributions is food wasted by people. This issue is mainly driven by an over-ordered food and misunderstanding about the method of food disposal. However, people could cease from creating food waste through the act of both restaurants and governments.To begin with, it is obvious that countries have wasted because the amount of food that people buy is more than the amount they need. The crucial factor of this behavior is that when people contemplate menus in a restaurant, they tend to order many items in order to satisfy their desire level. Eventually, a lot of food scraps are left when these people finish eating their meals. Another potential cause could be because people do not know how to deal with food scraps. As a result, they might understand that putting wasted food into a garbage is the only solution they could do. This is exemplified by statistics published by Thai waste association which demonstrate that more than a half of waste in Thailand come from household food.A possible solution for this matter could be for restaurants to fine their customers who leave some food. This policy possibly encourages customers to carefully think of the reasonable amount of food when they order. In addition, from the country’s level governments could also educate their citizens including companies in the food-service industry about how to do with food waste due to the fact that some edible items could be food for animals. For instance, authorities could give an instruction demonstrating that dogs can be fed with remaining food such as rice or bread while remaining vegetables can be food for rabbits.In conclusion, people waste food since they order food by what they want without considering the amount and most of them misunderstand about the way to dispose of food waste. Nevertheless, this concern can be coped with the penalty by restaurants as well as the guidance from governments regarding feeding animal with food scraps.; One of the main reasons for the waste of food is the way people behave. The waste of food has become a problem in many countries, and large amounts of food are thrown away every day. The causes of this phenomenon are many, but the main ones are consumer behavior, overproduction and inadequate storage. Also, a culture of abundance in many countries leads people to over-purchase and over-prepare. For example, in the shops many fruits and vegetables with small defects are thrown away, which means that many unused products are wasted even before they reach the consumer. It is also important to mention the problem of overproduction. Food producers often produce more than they need to satisfy consumers' needs. Excess food, which does not find a buyer in time, is wasted. One of the ways to fight food waste is to educate consumers about the proper storage of food and to make meal plans to avoid over-purchasing. Also, inadequate storage conditions in some parts of the food supply chain make it difficult for consumers to use food before it spoils. Also, many countries have started food distribution programs to help distribute food to those in need. In addition, some policies should be adopted to reduce the aesthetics of the goods so that the food is sold at a discount and thrown away. The main thing is that with education and changes in strategic direction, we can reduce food waste considerably and help both the environment and the needy.
1025;Write about the following topic.In many countries, a small number of people earn extremely high salaries. Some people believe that this is good for the country, but others think that governments should not allow salaries above a certain level.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In many parts of the world, few people get a lot of money thanks to their job. It is believed by some that this is an advantage for the country, while it is thought by others that governments should put a limit above which salaries cannot be.In my opinion, I believe that not only people have to be rewarded for their performance, but also their wage salary has to be proportional to the benefits that they are leading to the country.For instance, due to the Covid a lot of people suffered several injuries which were cured only thanks to the doctors and the nurses. For this reason, since they are saving lifes everyday,it seems unbelievable the fact that they are earning much less money than football players.Another example can be found in people involved in the national security: I believe that it would be fairer if these professionals were paid more than an influencer.However, in our society this figures (such as doctors) are paid by governments through taxes, while football players or influncers gain incomes by private companies.In order to not impose an heavier taxation, politics should categorise jobs basing on their importance in the society. Hence, we will have a specific amount that these employers can earn.Thus, if these no-fundamental workers (like actors or actress) are earning more money than the precise level chosen, these will be used as funds to increase life-saving jobs' salary.In conclusion, I believe that highest salaries should exist only if we are referring to a job that is needed by everyone.; The advantage of high salaries is that they stimulate economic growth. Those who advocate high salaries argue that they stimulate economic growth. High salaries encourage people to work in demanding areas. For example, a successful entrepreneur in the IT industry can create thousands of jobs. High salaries motivate people to work harder. On the other hand, opponents argue that a large gap between salaries creates social inequality and undermines the social fabric. When a small number of people earn extremely high salaries, it reduces the opportunities for the majority to earn less, which can lead to tension in society. To my mind, it seems that, although high salaries can be justified in some areas, high social inequality can have a negative impact on society. Those who advocate the cap on salaries argue that they encourage a fairer distribution of resources, so that everyone has equal access to education, health care and housing. Countries like Sweden and Denmark, which have limited inequality through high taxation, have achieved high standards of living and social equality. Accordingly, I believe that the most appropriate approach is a combination of the two. In the public sector, governments should set a salary cap and increase tax on excessive earnings, while leaving the salaries of private companies up to the market. If governments want to have a successful and cohesive society, they should make it a priority to address the issue of social inequality.
233;Write about the following topic.In some parts of the world people try to find out one's own family history. Why do people do this? Do you think it is a positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"At present, discovering one`s own family history is becoming more and more commom. In the following paragraphs, I will present the motives why people do that and the reason I strongly believe this is important and have positive effects on people.Probably the most crucial motive people search for their family`s past is to find out about any chronical diseases. One of society`s biggest concern nowadays is healthy leaving. Therefore, by knowing the family health history and genetic predisposition to a specific disease such as cancer or diabetes, one can prepare and take the appropriate mesures to prevent it or have an early treatment.Moreover, another reason people may seek for their ancestors`s history is to build a sense of belonging. Human beings need to feel welcomed and inserted into a culture; a community`s identity is as important as an individual one, as it provides people with the opportunity to grow and develop relantioships. When people know about their family history, their sense of belonging is promoted, and they can actively participate in their culture and contribute to their community.As mentioned in the previous paragraphs, people search about family history for health and cultural reasons. One and the other do impact positivily a person`s life, as being healthy and part of a community integrate people`s satisfaction about living.To summarize, one may try to find out about their family history for two main motives, one being about their health and the other one about feeling part of a community. Both reasons are important and have positive impacts on one`s life."; People are occupied with genealogy for many reasons, and the knowledge they get from this can give different perspectives on family history. Family history research has become popular in many parts of the world as individuals seek to explore their family background. This activity is often motivated by a desire for personal identity, cultural connection and knowledge of one's roots. For example, many descendants of immigrant families are particularly interested in their ancestors' travels, struggles and cultures. First of all, knowledge about the family's history gives a sense of belonging. In an age where individualism often overshadows the communal, it is a way of making a connection to the past generations and the cultural background. A family history project can also provide information about the medical history of the family, so individuals can make better health decisions. They learn about the illnesses and disorders that have been transmitted through the family and they can subsequently take a preventive and prophylactic attitude towards their own health. Such knowledge strengthens the sense of belonging to a family tradition and gives a feeling of security. In some cultures, genealogy is a way of measuring social rank and status, and this has been seen to cause a number of negative social consequences. Obsession with genealogy can lead, for example, to a difficult and uncontrolled desire for social status, or to an exaggerated focus on one's own lineage and to prejudices and prejudices. Nevertheless, even though family history can have some disadvantages, I think they are minor compared to the benefits. When approached with respect and a sense of common humanity, genealogy can bring people closer to their roots and each other and ultimately enrich their lives. In summary, I think that genealogy is generally a good thing. It strengthens personal identity, gives cultural insight and information about the importance of health.
987;Write about the following topic.Information technology is changing many aspects of our lives and now dominates our home, leisure and work activities.To what extent do the benefits of information technology outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;There is no doubt that these days information technology has invaded our space and dominated our home leisure and work. However, the question: is dominating our lives by this technology have a negative or positive impact on our lives? Is considered one of the most controversial issues today. In this essay, I am going to examine this phenomenon from both viewpoints.On one side of the argument, some people argue that the benefits considerably outweigh the disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is integrating technology in every aspect eases our lives and decreases hardworking. For example, advanced houses with integrated voice commands give the person the ability to achieve multiple tasks without any physical activity. Moreover, the technology allows people to connect multiple devices with an email address and control them remotely. One good illustration of that you can switch on and off your home AC while you are at work by the WIFI technology.On the other hand, it is also possible to consider it with the opposing case. It is often argued that in fact using advanced technology increase the number of unhealthy people. People often have this opinion because people become lazier, and their daily activity dramatically decreases making them prone to diseases.As we have seen, there are no easy answers to this question. On balance, however, I tend to believe that using advanced information technology should be limited to simple tasks, so at any point if a technical error happened you can resume your life without any obstacles.; The debate about the advantages and disadvantages of this change is varied. Although information technology has made a significant contribution to many aspects of our lives, we must not forget that there are also disadvantages to consider. Firstly, it has greatly improved communication and has opened up many opportunities for collaboration and working remotely, which has created a greater sense of work-life balance and flexibility. Secondly, there is no doubt that technology has made the world much smaller and the connections much faster. Streaming services, gaming and social media have diversified our leisure choices and given us instant access to a wide variety of entertainment. As a result, we have become more connected around the world. During the Avian flu pandemic, many organizations used a remote working model to continue their business in difficult conditions. Nevertheless, these advantages are not as pronounced as the disadvantages. There is a great concern about a lack of personal contact. This broad access to information and entertainment can increase our understanding of the world and enrich our personal lives, which is undeniably beneficial. However, there is also a risk of deterioration in social and interpersonal skills. There is also the danger that the excessive use of technology can lead to psychological problems such as depression and anxiety through the reliance on social media and cyberbullying. The real challenge is to strike a balance between these two factors and make the most of the benefits while being aware of the downside risks.
1033;Write about the following topic.It is inevitable that traditional cultures will be lost as technology develops. Technology and traditional cultures are incompatible.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many people hold the view that traditional culture and technological development cannot coexist as the latter catch on, the former will be bound to disappear. I totally disagree with this because both can be implemented jointly by putting technology at the service of tradition and through pilot projects.To begin with, technological progress, which is making major strides in our daily lives, is the means by which local mores, custom and traditions could be brought back to life, proving they are compatible. In fact, by tapping technology to make tradition far more attractive, considerably more audience will be engaged into such activities. Bologna is a case in point, since, thanks to digital machines and drones which have supported housewives into the making of , the traditional celebration of “making pasta day ” has recently being turned into a successful events, which draws people from country as far afield as China.Another example of possible coexistence is the possibility to heighten awareness of people costumes through the creation of pilot projects which bring both habits and technology to a new whole level. This can be put into practice by setting a direct connection to cultural heritage of a specific area of the world to those who do not have access easily. To this end, many primary schools in New York have developed a project in which, owing to the ultimate high speed connection, pupils who come from abroad can learn ancient craft directly from a master located in their country of origin.To conclude, I firmly believe that traditional culture and technology development are widely compatible as the technology can positively beef up the presence of cultural traditions nowadays, so as to keep its memory Alive. In addition, pioneering projects can be implemented to underpin cultural awareness amongst youngsters.; The views are controversial. It is undeniable that the development of technology has transformed many aspects of society. However, I think that traditional cultures can coexist with technology rather than be erased by technology. But one thing I want to mention is that indigenous peoples have used YouTube to record their dances and songs and make them available to the younger generation and other parts of the world, thus revitalizing their traditions. For example, the digitalization of cultural objects, oral history and traditional music can be available to a wider audience than ever before. It is also possible to communicate with relatives and friends in a more efficient way. For example, farmers can use an app to monitor the weather forecast and the market price, and they can adopt smart farming, which preserves their traditional farming techniques while adopting new technology. In short, while the development of technology may challenge the existence of traditional cultures, it may also enrich them. However, it is also important to recognize the risks that technology brings, such as the standardization of culture, which can lead to the dilution of local culture. Therefore, it is important to integrate the conservation of local culture with the development of technology to ensure the vitality of local cultures in the face of change. Instead of seeing technology and traditional cultures as incompatible, a more nuanced understanding is that they can coexist, change and flourish together.

Never has this area been exploded before so researchers could discover crucial information for thesis and tourists could appreciate a fabulous landscape. However, discovering those faraway environments could increase environment-related issues such as climatic change.South Pole is a place which has ever seen human activities before, and it seems to have numerous discoveries to make. Indeed, scientists which fauna and flora are the current studies, could find new mode of the marine life and discover new species. Moreover, people who are interested in travelling to South Pole might now do it, children who dreamed about polar animals could see them. Thus, the tourism should create new jobs and develop economic growth.Nevertheless, as each breakthrough that the society does, there are repercussions. In this case, the harmful effect of this discovery is global warming because when humans go somewhere, they let a carbon footprint which directly changes the environment. For instance, if individuals had to travel to South Pole, they would only use air or marine transport such as cruise ship which pollute the area with greenhouse gases. As a result, those greenhouse gases can warm nature which, unfortunately, would melt the ice and have a detrimental impact on the landscapes. As a consequence, in the forthcoming decades, this panorama may disappear. Thereby, if scientists want to study this natural area, they could not or in a limited way.To conclude, the advantages could be to discover new landscapes and how species can live in this hostile area. However, just going into this remote natural environment could destroy it before discovering something.; One of the most obvious advantages of the access to the remote areas is the opportunity for scientific research. However, this development has both advantages and disadvantages that should be considered carefully. In addition, technological development has made it easier for scientists to make expeditions and collect information that was previously inaccessible to them. For example, scientists can make important studies on climate change, melting ice and species diversity in extreme conditions. Such research can help to explain world phenomena and contribute to the development of relevant policy to protect the environment. Eco-tourism can raise awareness of the conservation and protection of fragile environments. It can also contribute to the local economy and support the isolated community. In addition, it can be a long-term beneficial effect for the local environment. However, the presence of tourists in the remote environment can have a negative impact on the environment, as well as on the local population and wildlife. In addition, the access to the remote environment has a negative effect on global warming. Air travel and tourist support services can contribute to climate change and can contradict the goals of scientific research to reduce climate change. I think it is important to balance scientific research with the conservation of these fragile environments to ensure that they are still accessible to future generations.

Some people,however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;This is a world that fast developing and full of pollution.there is a worldwide problem whether economic progress is the most important goal when the other types problem are increasing. In my word is economic progress is important than other problems.Firstly,this is an economic world. human life condition is base on their income. For example,there have a village with poor people. They might working hard for live but they must have no time to think about other goal. This is reason why the governments to develop social economic . it is not uncommon that government have no money to solve the problem that environment pollution and others.Second, although economic progress is necessary for people but it also lead to other problems. With the increasing income it might need more resources to build the country. If it not solved correctly that give rise to more problems. The other types of progress will have a good developing when the economic progress finished and the government get enough money.Overall , i prefer economic progress to other types of progress. The better life come from money and the solution of the other types problem are come from the good economy.; For many governments, economic progress is the foundation of national stability and prosperity. Often, an expanding economy leads to increased employment, higher living standards and higher public spending on health care and education. But critics say that a strong economy leads to the neglect of other aspects of national life, such as social welfare, the environment and cultural development. Such aspects are essential for comprehensive national development and, ultimately, for the well-being of the nation. Take, for example, the economic progress of China and India over the past few decades: millions of people have risen out of poverty and life expectancy has risen considerably. In my opinion, however, economic progress is important but not the only goal for governments. In many developed countries, for example, the pursuit of economic progress has led to increasing inequality and the destruction of the environment. The rapid deforestation of the Amazonian forests to make way for agriculture has not only destroyed the biodiversity of the region, but also has caused social unrest among indigenous people whose livelihoods depend on this natural environment. And so, it is essential for governments to pursue a sustainable model of development that not only encourages economic growth, but also protects social equality, the environment and cultural diversity. Countries such as Sweden show how such a model can combine economic stability, high living standards, strong social welfare and protection of the natural environment. In conclusion, it is important for governments to focus on achieving economic progress, but also to pursue other goals for a truly developed and harmonious society.
555;Write about the following topic.Many parents today organise extra classes for their children after school and at the weekends.Do you feel that this is a worthwhile thing to do or do you feel children have enough education at school?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays educational institutions are equipped with devices that were unimaginable only a few years ago, which offer many opportunities to children to study every kind of subject. In other words, the technology introduced in schools helps many children to learn various subjects with different gadgets, such geography, art, maths by computers or history by means of audio-visual-techniques. However, I believe that children thanks to these appealing methods of learning have enough education and they need some time to unwind and experience their life with other activites.To begin with, apply children to extra classes at the weekends has become an issue of debate by many people. I hold firmly to the belief that children after schools need to dedicate their free time on sports. However, sports and other physical activities help young people to enhance their concentration, self-esteem and cognitive skills, social skills with their peer group. For example the most popular and suitable to children are sports with teams, such as football, basketball etc... where children could learn how to collaborate with other mates and the leadership skills gained in sports can help kids to excel in school, life and in the workplace, such as organising a good teamwork.On the other hand, there are few parents who argue that children need to attend extra classes at schools during the weekends. For instance, the world is still facing a global pandemic of covid-19, which caused many problems of attendency of students in many educational institutions due to various measures introduced. However this led many students to lazyness and reduction of methods of gaining knowledge, because it is widely believed that online lessons are not interactive as the lessons in presence. Moreover using continously a technological gadget for hours may cause distraction and negative mental effects. So the better solution for some people is to let their children do extra classes in presence in order to make up for the hours lost during the online lessons.To sum up, children need to experience different activities afterschool in order to have a good educational career. However some parents consider the extra classes an acceptable opportunity to not lose the methods of studying.; Writing task. Today, many parents choose to give their children extra classes after school and on Saturdays. The aim of this is often to give children the opportunity to develop their abilities to the fullest and to give them a competitive advantage. I argue that this is not always a good thing and that there are too many things that the child can do. In addition, there is much research showing that children thrive best when they have a well-balanced life that includes time for play, creativity and socializing with their peers. Most schools today are well organized to provide comprehensive education and offer a wide range of subjects and extra-curricular activities, such as sports and music. However, the incessant pursuit of extra lessons can lead to greater stress and burnout among students. It can dilute the child's learning experience when the pressure to succeed and excel outside of school is also added. For example, many educational systems focus on developing the whole child, not only academically, but also socially and creatively. In short, it is important to keep in mind that children thrive best when they have a well-balanced childhood that promotes both learning and personal development. Rather than taking children out for unnecessary lessons, it may be more sustainable to support the child's current school situation and also allow them space to develop as an individual. I have seen many of my friends experience stress and anxiety because their days were filled with after-school lessons, leaving little time for play and relaxation.
305;Write about the following topic.Many people use written language in a less formal and more relaxed way. Why? Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, written language is used in comparatively more informal and relaxed way. I assume that it happens because of the need of making communication easier and faster. Without features of formal written language it is simplier to share your idea in a shorter period of time. This option is essential in a modern temp of life. This essay will cover both advantages and disadvantages of this development.The less formal and tense written language provides some pros. First of all, without formalization the process of communication requires less amount of time. Then letters consists of less number of symbols and can help to solve the discussed problem much faster. Moreover, this way of communication does not support formal borders between members of a dialogue. Then it is easier to come closer with the interlocutor and feel no pressure during the using of written language.On the other hand, development of making written language more informal and relaxed has some cons. Firstly, communication goes less respectful. Then interlocutors have almost no opportunity to pay a respect to each other. Formalized written language is significant in issue of social borders that can hihlight a paid respect. Secondly, sometimes the main gist of the letter goes unclear, because informal language is more relaxed. In these conditions, the quidity of the letter can be hidden with less formal features. If participants of the communication are not close, they will not understand each other correctly.In conclusion I would like to say that the process of using written language in a more informal way has both advantages and disadvantages. It can be revealed in different situations. That is why everyone should have their own opinion based on the information discussed in this essay.;" To a large extent, the development of written language is influenced by the emergence of social media and instant messaging applications. The emergence of digital media, societal changes, and the impact of popular language on people's preferences are some of the reasons why written language is evolving. There are many examples of shorthand, abbreviations, slang, and emoticons that have been used to convey a message quickly and informally. For example, the letters “LOL” and “BTW” have replaced the words “laughing out loud” and “got a minute” instead of the words ""laughing out loud"" and ""got a minute"" respectively, and this has made the written language more informal and faster. The informality of this language can increase the clarity of the message, making it more intimate and personal. In addition, this informal language creates a sense of community, especially among young people who feel comfortable expressing themselves informally. However, while this relaxed use of language has its advantages, it also has its disadvantages. Especially in academic and professional situations, when clarity and formality are essential, the emergence of informal language may confuse people and reduce the image of the prestige of written communication. On the other hand, in social media, such as social media, the brand can attract more customers. Knowing when to adapt the style of the written language is an important factor in navigating the increasingly informal world. Finally, there is a risk that when casual expressions are used instead of precise language, an important nuance may be lost."
1161;Write about the following topic.More and more people are relying on the private car as their major means of transportation.Describe some of the problems over-reliance on cars can cause, and suggest at least one possible solution.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;That of trasportation is a question that have troubled all the people over the world, whatever it is the city or town in which they live. In the last years people used to relying on the private car to move around. . Although the possible reasons that persuaded people to use private cars, the problems that rise from their excessive use, such us traffic and pollution, are harsh consequences to be accepted. I think that an improvement of public trasportation and to incentive the use of ecological means of trasport like bicycle should be possible solution to those issues.Cars are considered the most confortable mean of trasport. In particular, if you have to move in a big cities like Milan. Indeed, means of trasports sometimes are late or full and also more unsafe. If you are a woman, for example, the use of public trasportation in some part of Italy is not safe mostly during the night hours. Another problem is that of comfort. If people use their car they can go whethever they want, when they want. If they have to spend more time in a place, they have not to be worried about the last bus they had to take to come back home.However, over-reliance of cars cause at least two big problmes: traffic and pollution. On the one hand, the problem of traffic will produce other issues such as anxiety and irritation. Indeed, if you have to go work in the morning and you live in a city like Rome you have to consider at least one hour spent in the traffic. Pollution is surely the most severe issue. Indeed, if all the people used to take a private car, then it is easely imaginable how much cars and fuel can be consumed daily. The two problems are linked, I want to underline, indeed, the noise pollution that derives from an intense traffic. It should be considered dangerous both for persons and animals.Two possible solutions to the problem of the over-reliance on cars are the following. Firstly, public trasportation should be improved. Indeed, if bus and tram were more safe and more confortable, then people would be more tent by their use. At least, they will solve the problem of traffic. On the other hand, I see the echologycal means of transport like bycicle as the new border to pass in order to save the world from pollution. One possible suggestion would be that of make cheaper the bycicle and also to give an economic subsidy to those people who decide to help the planet using them.In conclusion, I believe that the the use of private cars, because of the problems that it causes, should be discouraged. Two possible solutions rely on the improvement of public trasportation and on the incentive can be given to those using non-polluting means of trasport; An important problem caused by cars is the threat to the environment. While they are convenient and flexible, private cars are a major cause of problems that affect urban planning and public health. There is no doubt that the vehicles are the main source of greenhouse gas emissions and are responsible for climate change. In addition, the traffic jams are causing a great deal of fuel waste and making a serious contribution to both the economic and the environment. Los Angeles, for example, is one of the worst cities in terms of air pollution and traffic congestion. People are increasingly moving away from the center of cities in order to get cheap housing, and this has led to a vicious circle of longer journeys and more traffic. Another problem caused by cars is the urban sprawl. In Tokyo, for example, the public transport system is a highly integrated part of the city’s life and this has had a positive effect on the traffic problem and reduced the number of private cars. The solution to the problem of cars is to develop public transport. Governments should invest in reliable, fast and affordable mass transport, such as buses, subways and trams. It is possible to create a healthier and more efficient society by promoting the use of public transport. In conclusion, the private car is convenient, but it is also associated with a number of serious problems.
1051;"Write about the following topic.Most people have forgotten the meaning behind traditional or religious festivals; during festival periods, people nowadays only want to enjoy themselves.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.";"In recent years, it is argued that many people have lost track of the meaning behind traditional and religious celebrations; Now, people seem to treat these celebrations as another holiday break. The following essay will fully endorse the statement and examine the reasons behind it.Firstly, there are several reasons why people forgot about the message behind celebrations. One of the most significant one is globalisation. As people start connecting with each other through social media worldwide, many people are too distracted with the latest trends and updates. A study from Yales University mentioned that 60% of the population on earth do not persuit the stories about their traditional roots and background. Hence, they do not celebrate festive or cultural events meaningfully. Another important reason is broken families. People who experienced a tough childhood without a male or female parent are not capable of understanding their own traditions and values. Therefore, they do not grasp the concept of cultural celebrations.Moreover, there are also cons to this arguments as people just want to take a holiday break. Although people may argue that it is important to remember the intention behind diverse celebrations, others just want to use the day for self-fulfillment purposes. For example, people would organise a party and invite friends over to their house so they can have a good time. Another argument that people only want enjoyment during festive periods is work-stress related illnesses. The majority of middle class workers are hardworking and dedicated to their job. However, the period of time for holiday breaks are significantly short and they just want to use the celebration events to rest at home. Despite the fact that they are neglecting their duties to demonstrate the meaning behind these celebrations to the younger generations, they also have a right to take care of themselves mentally and physically before others.In conclusion, there are both sides of the argument on why people think others have forgotten the meaning behind event celebrations and why this is not neccesarily true all the time. Personally, I agree that people should always find the meaning behind these celebrations in order to understand themselves better."; This view is the subject of an interesting discussion. Although in many cultures it is true that secular holidays have become the dominant type of celebration, I think it is also too simple and not taking into account the complexity of modern festivals. In some countries, Christmas has become a secular and commercial time, with its religious significance almost forgotten. Similarly, fireworks and social gatherings during festivals like Diwali can sometimes replace the religious significance of the celebration. Many communities are very active in the preservation of traditional practices and beliefs, for example, in Ramadan. While many Muslims have a festive meal after fasting, a large part of the celebration is still charity and spiritual reflection. The same is true of other cultures. In the era of globalization, people have access to the festivals of different cultures. This may inspire people to look deeper into the traditions and values of their forefathers and their own. Local festivals often revive old handicrafts, music and spirituality and offer a mixture of fun and cultural appreciation. The meaning of festivals is retained, though in a different way, in the richness of the cultural environment. In conclusion, although festivals have become more and more fun, the traditional essence has not disappeared.

Others, however, think that music can have a negative influence on both.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Music is the moonlight in the gloomy night of life.It is the universal language of mankind.There are mixed opinions about music on whether it is advantageous or not to individuals and society.This essay will discuss about pros and cons of music being part of our life.Some people have a perception that playing or listening to music is not beneficial in any manner. They feel music separates a person from socializing and that it is a form of addiction and distraction.Especially, parents feel that their child's concentration is impacted while multitasking with music and studies.For extroverts its a sort of discomfort or hindrance.Few extroverts feel better to share their feelings and difficulties with others than staying alone and listening to a song. Few recorded instances has suggested that sad music inculcates negative thoughts and aggression while in depression.On the other hand, there are people who think that music having a negative effect on individual and society is completely preposterous.They feel that tunes produces a kind of pleasure which human nature cannot do without.Music is a form of expression of feelings rather than being a hindrance.It greatly helps people to overcome their hurdles.Soothing and melodious music gives a refreshing effect.Jazz and Pop music facilitates society to come together and dance.Concerrts helps certain groups to spend time for relaxation from their busy schedule.Not only that, singing or playing instruments is a form of expression of their feelings.The essay argued that though music is considered to be a distraction , it is a form of rejuvenation to both society and individuals of all age groups.; In this essay, I will discuss both these views and then give my own opinion. There is no doubt that music has a universal language that helps people communicate and understand each other across different cultures. There is also evidence that music has a therapeutic effect. For example, listening to music can relieve stress, improve your mood and increase your ability to concentrate. In contrast, there are also disadvantages. For example, music is often used to help people with mental illness, because music helps people express their emotions that are difficult to express. In my opinion, music is a powerful medium that reflects the complexities of human experience. For example, some rap songs present violence as a way to solve the conflict and can influence impressionable listeners. In the end, the impact of music depends on the context, such as the content of the song, the audience and the artist's intentions. By promoting a positive message and encouraging critical listening, we can enjoy the benefits of music without being overwhelmed by its disadvantages. Although it can convey harmful messages, its power to unite, heal and inspire far outweighs its negative properties.
587;Write about the following topic.Nowadays, sports is a big business with high earnings for professional sports people and companies involved both financially and other ways. Is this a positive or negative development for sports?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is argued that using mobile devices is as antisocial as smoking and that in certain areas smoking has been forbidden so mobile devices should be prohibited as well. I strongly disagree with this statement because this would not solve the initial problem and could turn out expensive as well.Firstly, banning mobile devices from certain places would be exagerated. This is because smoking actually damages your body, while the use of mobile phones is comparatively harmless. For example, a recent research found out that the risk of lung cancer grows by 0,02% with every cigarette, while high screen time has less damaging side effects like the loss of concentration. Altough the use of mobile phones is sometimes antisocial, I think that we should concentrate on the origins of this problem than simply prohibit it in certain areas.Secondly, banning mobile devices would have a regulatory side effect which could be expensive. The government would have to decide on new laws as well as implement them. Furthermore, it would be no easy task for the police to control these rules in an efficient way. As a result, police would struggle with a high workload. Admittely, I have enough faith in our legal system and I am sure that they could manage it but I think that we have more prescious und urgent tasks to concentrate on.In conclusion, I strongly disagree with banning mobile devices in certain areas. However, I admit that we use our phones too much which sometimes leads to antisocial behaviour. Nevertheless, prohibiting the phones in certain areas would not solve this problem and could as well be expensive for the government.; One of the main arguments in the development of modern sports is the increasing commercialization of sports, where professional athletes are rewarded with huge salaries and many organizations from teams to advertising companies earn a lot of money. There are people who argue that this development is good or bad for the essence of sport. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are some of the best football players, who earn millions of dollars not only in the clubs they play for, but also through endorsements with global brands. So this financial boom in the sports industry can be seen as a positive development in that athletes are paid for their talent, their efforts and the great income they produce. The increased money in the sport has also made training facilities and coaching classes better, which in turn increases the level of competition. On the other hand, it is a concern that the focus on monetary gain raises questions about the integrity of sports. Moreover, many athletes can focus on their performance and their contribution to society, both in terms of charitable work and community work. Furthermore, over-commercialization may turn the public against the sport, since the sport may be seen as a vehicle for the spread of advertisements rather than real competition. For example, when it comes to the escalation of doping in sports, many athletes feel the need to perform and get a bigger salary to gain entry to higher leagues and therefore perhaps better deals. It is therefore important to maintain a balance between commercialization and the integrity of sports. In summary, the commercialization of sport has both good and bad sides, while it provides security, better training conditions and increased international exposure for both the athletes and the sports themselves, it also undermines the basis of fair competition and hard work.
1133;Write about the following topic.People in all modern societies use drugs, but today's youth are experimenting with both legal and illegal drugs, and at an increasingly early age. Some sociologists claim that parents and other members of society often set a bad example.Discuss the causes and some effects of widespread drug use by young people in modern day society. Make any recommendations you feel are necessary to help fight youth drug abuse.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The use of drugs has been a warning habit in modern day society. In some research, it shows that households are losing their financing easily due to the fact that one of the parents has been addicted to drugs. Although there are some drugs which were approved by the government to be used moderately, yet some people are using these drugs heavily.This has drawn the attention of the youth either by a drug addict parent or a friend. Moreover, the number of youngsters taking drugs has increased dramatically throughout the years as there are people who provide these drugs in the black market. This critical issue has caused serious issues both socially and mentally.The social and mental impact of using drugs by the youngsters have damaged the educational progress, the social participation such as family and friends gatherings. Additionally, lack of stamina, weight loss, and loss of appetite are key factors of excessive use of drugs.There is a number of contributing elements to the phenomena. One of these elements is the sense of belonging to a group. Since humans are social animals, young people want to have the feeling of being accepted and loved, and this can be sensible when it comes to a group of friends. Therefore, once someone introduces a drug, the rest of the group will try, and if one says no, then they will be rejected. However, this rejection can be helping to solve this alarming issue.The solution is to find a way to distinguish the types of drugs and legalize the ones that do not harm greatly and prepare in parallel the better ways to control the consumption of drugs.;" Youth drug abuse is often influenced by their environment, particularly by family life. One of the main reasons for the widespread use of drugs among young people today is the bad example set by their parents and other members of society. For example, it is very easy to get legal drugs, such as alcohol, cannabis and medicine, as well as illegal drugs. Peer pressure is also a major cause of drug abuse among young people; they are unable to resist peer pressure and start using drugs to conform to the group. A major effect of widespread drug use by young people is their health; they become addicted to drugs and experience severe problems with mental illness. School dropouts, criminal behavior and family discord are also common consequences. To combat youth drug abuse, several measures can be taken. Education is the most effective, and schools should offer a comprehensive program that educates students about the dangers and consequences of drug abuse. Besides, early drug use can lead to later adult addiction, which is a vicious cycle. Parents should also play a more active role in teaching their children about drugs and preventing them from taking drugs themselves. In the end, the causes of drug use among young people are complicated, but the public should pay more attention to education, parental guidance and easy access to support services."

For this reason, attention should be given to colour schemes when decorating places such as offices and hospitals.How true is this statement?How far does colour influence people’s health and capacity for work?;The colours and its affect on humans feelings always interested the psychologists and become a part of their researches. This researches get the attention of the organizations and help them to shape their designs of their offices or buildings. In this essay, I will talk about the affects of colour and its influence on some parts of human's life.It is true that certain colours are affecting our mental state and feelings at some level. Because of our visual plays an important role in our pyschology, colours are becoming important issue that needs to be point out. For example, the alertness effect of red colour on human's feeling is well known by the goverments. In order to alert people, stop signs or traffic lights are always include some level of red colour. This way, humans can be warned and accidents numbers can be decreased.Also, this affect of colours can play a big role in our health and work place. To give an example, the infinity effect of white colour is always used by hospitals. They paint their desks, tables, rooms, bathrooms or walls to white colour most of the time. This way, they calm their patients and help them to relieve their stress. Another example is grey. It is one of the favourite colour of the companies. They use this colour mainly in their office to make sure their employees are not distracted so they can finish their task.To conclude, colours are very affective in our mood and feelings. They are being used by the organizations to benefit from this effect.; Colour not only influences our mood, but can also have a considerable effect on our health and capacity for work. Psychologists have long been aware of the powerful influence that colour can have on human emotions and behavior. Studies have found that certain colours stimulate creativity and focus the mind. Blue, for example, is often associated with calmness and dependability, which makes it an appropriate choice for those places where concentration and clarity of thought are essential. The choice of colours in the workplace can therefore have a significant influence on the efficiency of the workforce. There are, of course, other considerations when choosing colours for a hospital. In a hospital, colour can have a particularly strong influence on the health of patients. However, colour can also have a positive influence on patient recovery and on the treatment of illnesses. Soft greens and blues can lower anxiety levels and encourage healing, while harsher, more stimulating colours such as bright reds can be distressing. The environment in which a patient is being treated can have a major influence on his recovery. In conclusion, it is clear that colour has an effect on people’s health and their capacity to work. By using the strategic application of colour in the design of places such as offices and hospitals, we can create working environments that promote not only productivity, but also emotional well-being and the speed of recovery. A comfortable working environment not only enhances the efficiency of the workforce, but also improves patient health and well-being. There is, therefore, no reason why, when planning the interior design of such places, we should not take the views of the psychologists into account.

Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"In development countries they must allow works for people who have skills and experience employees from poor countries. I agree with this point of view because everyone they should have a chance. There were a opportunities and benefits.The first point, I would like to make is that there were a great opportunities for both rich countries and people who came from poor areas. When people thinking to transfer abroad there were many reason but the most important when they want a chance to show of there craft and ability. Such as, Indian people they travelled many areas and they give them a lot of discoveries and skills; moreover, the rich countries need some people to help to make their country better place for living. For example, I have read an article in the newspaper they talked about development countries like UK, US and Arabic countries they need those people to improve their economy and life.The second point, I will clarify is that there were many benefits when this countries allow jobs for those. They will be equality for all ;furthermore, there will be a improvement in living. For instance, I have saw a T.V decomontry they say "" In United States there are a equality and improvement in live between people they came from Africaand citizens they help them to have good education, skills and experience also they contribute the US economy to growth "".Finally, we can say that there were a opportunities and benefits for both sides. I am with this to have good life for all. I hope in the future poor countries they can take benefits from those people and developed their country to came better than now ."; I think that rich countries should open their job market for skilled and knowledgeable employees from poor countries, because not only does this practice relieve the labor shortage in developed countries, but also helps to develop and build in poor countries. The world economy is becoming increasingly interconnected, which makes the exchange of skills and knowledge across borders essential for innovation and development. For example, countries such as Canada and Germany have introduced a points-based system that gives priority to the application of foreign experts with advanced skills. For example, in developed countries, such as technology, engineering, medicine and other areas, there is a shortage of professional workers. By attracting more talent from developing countries, rich countries can obtain a variety of experts and professionals. When these people work abroad, they usually send remittances to their families and communities, which can help improve the local economy. Moreover, allowing talented people from poor countries to participate in the global economy will also bring more equality to the world. And cultural exchanges, so as to encourage creativity and innovation. For example, a nurse from the Philippines who works in the United States can support their families and improve their life. It can also help break the cycle of poverty, and so on. In short, developed countries should encourage talented people from poor countries to work in developed countries. Not only can this solve the labor shortage, but also help solve the problem of international equality and enrich the world's cultural resources. This practice can be beneficial to both parties, and the world can become a more harmonious and prosperous place.
973;Write about the following topic.Some organisations believe that their employees should dress smartly. Others value quality of work above appearance.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Manners in the workplace have always been a topic that is discussed by many people as it is essential to know how we should behave in such a formal environment. Some companies give the opinion that their workers should have a smart look while others consider the attitude toward the job more important.To my mind, appearance should not the only thing to be considered. We can dress smartly and impress others, but it is only the first impression. Therefore, productivity, quality of work, and the way we are responsible for our tasks are things that make us outstanding workers. Moreover, it is obvious that the success of one company does not depend on how its employees dress but on how it is organized.In spite of the fact that dressing does not play a key role in the value of a worker, a neat and intelligent appearance still gives us significant benefits. I always suggest that one should dress suitably in different situations. In fact, it is not crucial for an organization to ask their employees to dress formally, but a set of smart casual clothes is something that we should wear when it comes to the working environment. It is because that wearing politely shows how we respect our jobs, our employers, and even our workmates. In some cases, a company's professionalism can be seen through the way its workers wear.To sum up, dressing smartly is not the best and only thing that one worker can do to have better performance. However, having a good appearance is something that great employees would do since it can be considered as their respect for the jobs.; The issue of the appearance of employees in companies and institutions often leads to two opposite views: some companies require employees to dress smartly and the appearance of the company's employees, while other companies, focusing on the quality of work, regardless of the attire of employees. Each view has its advantages and disadvantages for the organization and for the employees. An important advantage of smartly dressed employees is that they respect each other and, in a way, all employees are responsible for the appearance of the company. This view is especially important for companies that often deal with customers and in the fields of law, finance and consulting, where a respectable appearance increases customer trust. On the other hand, companies that put the quality of work above the appearance of employees usually believe that creativity and efficiency are more important than a strict dress code. Some technological companies, such as Google and Microsoft, have become known for their casual dress code, which allegedly increases employee satisfaction and increases creativity. According to this view, the work performed by employees should determine what is required of them. For example, in the field of graphic design and advertising, clothing that encourages comfort and freedom of expression may stimulate creativity more than formal clothing. My view is that while smart appearance has a positive influence on the company's culture, it is the quality of the work performed by employees that should be given priority. For this reason, it is appropriate to create a flexible dress code that reflects the mission of the company and the habits of the industry and strikes a balance between a respectable appearance and comfort and freedom of expression. .

Others believe that some information is too important or too valuable to be shared freely.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In recent years, some people believe that it is good to share information about scientific research, business and the academic field to many people. Others reckon that such informations are too important or too valuable to be share for free. Here are discussions of the statements and my opinion.By development of the technology, people can more likely to access to valuable information such as experimental results and interviewing results of citizens than before. Some people use it for their academic interests or for the business strategies, so that people believe that such information contribute to companies profits or individuals' advantages in academic. For example, many of the medical students read dissertation of diseases, which were written in the past. By reading and using the scientific information students will become excellent professionals.On the other hand, people can access informations from any countries via internet. Recently, increasing the cyber crimes is the serious problem all over the world. Therefore some people reckon that it is too risky to share valuable informations. If information on valuable national research results is leaked, the country would had enormous loss for the economy.To sum up ,sharing as much informations as possible is useful for the everyone to improve their academic skills and contribute to their companies, while easier access to every aspects of informations might bring disadvantages such as information leakage or cybercrime. In my opinion, I mostly agree with it is good to share information, but I believe the source of information needs to be careful not to misuse the sources.; Why do some people think it is a good idea to share information? Open information supporters argue that open access to data and information encourages the collaboration of scientists and, as a result, a faster development of medicine and technology. Some believe that some information is too important or too valuable to be shared. In the business world, for example, proprietary information such as trade secrets and intellectual property rights are seen as the backbone of a company’s competitive advantage. In the academic world, open access to data and research material encourages the participation of students and academics from all countries, which in turn creates a more educated society. In my opinion, a balanced approach is needed. For example, a pharmaceutical company that has developed a new medicine might be reluctant to share its research methods for fear that a competitor might be able to copy the new drug without investing in the research. Knowledge sharing should be encouraged, particularly in fundamental research that can lead to broader societal benefits, but also in areas where proprietary information could be misused to the detriment of society. It is equally important to protect proprietary information that can be used to the detriment of society. In conclusion, the openness of the scientific and business worlds must be maintained in order to make progress in the field of research and development.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Environmental problems are the biggest issue that people have to concern and by product form fossil fuels is one of causes. Someone think one way that can reduce result from fuels is sale car fuels in higher price. In my opinion, I disagree with this because highly price of oil leads to other problems such as financial problem and impact to food price, moreover, we can heal their environment by other ways.The negative effects of increasing the cost of vehciles fuels are improtant to human life. The significant points is price of basic requirements, for instance, foods and medicines which have to transportation by trucks that use oil fuels for movement. The expensive fuels increase business costs, so their products price are rising up. Futhermore, social problems follow by financial problems. When poor people do not have money but they still hunger, they will steal some food or water this situation roads to social problems.Other ways to reduce environment problems, the causes of this problem are not only fossil fuel but also agricultural or industial aspect which we have to focus on. Intustial areas are the top areas that make lot of pollutions such as air pollution, water pollution from thier procesing and chemical pollution which they use during process. Those of them lead to many problems and effect to qulity of human life. Moveover agricultural areas, there produce many of gas which result to global warming.In conclusion, the increasing car fuels might reduce some of environmental problems but also have drawback to population life. We should to chooce other ways to protect enviromant without effect to our life.; Proponents of the price increase argue that this will reduce the number of vehicles on the road and thus reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. While reducing the cost of fuel may stimulate consumers to take more sustainable measures, I believe that this measure alone will not be sufficient to tackle the underlying causes of the environment. Economic theory predicts that the demand for goods decreases as their prices increase. The same theory could apply to fuel, resulting in a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. But the higher cost of fuel can affect poorer households, which rely on the vehicle for their daily transport and can no longer afford to do so. For example, when fuel prices rose significantly in the early noughties, many people shifted to more fuel-efficient vehicles and alternative means of transport. Not only that, the higher price of fuel can also increase inequality in society without significantly changing the overall environment. A more comprehensive approach to solving the environment would be to develop public transport, invest in renewable energy sources and promote the development of education and awareness of sustainable consumption. For example, by implementing a broader system that combines economic, social and technological measures, it will be easier to develop a sustainable society in the long run. In short, the price of fuel can be a short-term solution to the environment, but it should not be considered a long-term solution. The culture of the environment can make a more lasting change.
135;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that school children should not be given homework by their teachers, whereas others argue that homework plays an important role in the education of children.Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The issue that whether teachers should assign homework or not has attracted great attention recently.Some people believe that homework is a good way to consolidate students'learning effect.However,others argue that homework exerts huge pressure on students,which is bad for their long-term development.As for me,appropriate homework should be seen as the better choice.I will explain my idea from two aspects.Firstly,homework could examine student's learning results.After teaching the basic content,giving some homework is important to consolidate the knowledge.As an old saying goes,practice makes things perfect.Only doing many practices,can we master the knowledge proficiently.There is an example.In my teaching experiences,I found the students finishing their homework better would achieve higher scores in final examination,while those who couldn't finish their ordinary homework would gain lower grades in any examination.And my translation skills were also improved by practicing the homework from my guiders who gave the targeted examination to me.Secondly,too much homework will cause so many negative effects,such as making students tired very much,causing their depressed mood and their bored emotion.For example,my brother's daughter always suffered from the huge homework which was assigned by his Chinese teacher.She once complained with me that everyday she felt tired and bored after finishing Chinese teacher's assignments.So appropriate homework is reasonable for most students and those ideas that the more homework,the better students' scores ,are wrong to certain extent.Sometimes huge homework is the reason that why some students'scores are reduced.In sum,removing homework is not an ideal option for student's improvement in learning,and reasonable homework provides us a better way to deal with the problem.That is to say,we should strike a balance between assigning homework and removing homework.; Proponents of abolishing homework claim that it increases the stress and anxiety of students. The necessity of homework in the education system is a controversial issue, which attracts many different opinions. In the first place, critics claim that not all children benefit equally from homework. Children already spend a long time in school, and if they have to do more homework, they will have even less time for recreation and family life. Homework enables students to practice what they have learned in the classroom and further develop their understanding of the subject. Those with less family support may find it difficult to cope with the work and thus become dissatisfied and give up. However, homework can be beneficial in some subjects. For example, doing mathematics homework reinforces the concepts learned during the day, and encourages the students to read books on their own. In my opinion, a balanced approach is required. Teachers should give homework which is appropriate to the lesson learned that day, and which considers the impact of the work on students’ well-being. If we encourage homework as a positive and a productive experience rather than a punishment, we can help students develop academically and emotionally.
525;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child's development while others think that it is important for children to go to school.Discuss the advantages of both methods and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In regards to the notion 'it is important for children to go to school', there are two contrasting opinions of supporting it and also disagreeing with it. Schools are conceptually thought to be essential and compulsory for many parents while others may not despite of what the society says.There are people who suggest that going to school is indeed necessary for children and students as it enables them to develop social ability and make friends which will ultimately be useful in the future. Attending school, a microsom of society, itself already teaches young students how to interact with other people ouside of family tree. Those who did not attend school when they were young may have severly low EQ or lacking interaction ability. For instance, an adult who was studying at home might not know how to respect and share objects with others. By being enrolled in a school, children can make remarkable childhood memories that may help them in the future when they are in a slump or depression.On the other hand, some people may disagree to this notion as they think studying at home is far more effective. Their argument might be that going to school would be a waste of time as children usually play around at school. Teaching children can be much more efficient as transportation time and playing time can be eliminatied by not going to school. Furthermore, as children do not have to go out, there will not be any conflicts on bullying or fight with friends. They will not fall onto deviation such as smoking, drinking et cetera which are usually encountered at school due to bad friends. Also, money can be saved by teaching at home as uniforms, for example, do not have to purchased.All in all, although young students might have number of advantages by not going to school, it is nevertheless more important to attend school in a daily basis to improve their social ability and interaction with other people.; Home schooling is flexible and can be adapted to a child's needs and pace. Home schooling is the most important educational issue among parents and teachers. It allows families to fit learning around their life and travel. A family interested in history might include historical sites in their curriculum, making learning practical and real. Parents can include their values and interests in their curriculum, making learning rich and interesting. On the other hand, school is a structured environment that facilitates socialization, a vital aspect of child development. Schools offer children opportunities to work with peers and teachers, building necessary skills like communication, cooperation, and conflict resolution. Children who are home schooled can receive more one-on-one attention from their parents than their peers in a traditional school, which can foster strong relationships and a deeper understanding of the subject. For me, while both approaches have their merits, school is a more social environment and better prepares children for a diverse world. For example, group projects foster teamwork and teach children how to benefit from the strengths of their peers, skills that are essential for the future workplace. School also offers a wide variety of viewpoints and experiences, which makes it easier for children to understand and accept others. In my opinion, the ideal approach is a hybrid that combines the strengths of both to create a more rounded education. Home schooling offers a more individualized approach to learning and a flexible schedule, but the socialization and coping skills that are developed in school are essential for long-term success.
323;Write about the following topic.Some people believe women are better leaders than men. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is argued by some individuals that men aren't skilled enough as women in regard to leadership. This essay disagrees with the given statement as leadership skills are not depending on gender but are strongly related to people's personality and work experience.The role of a leader should not be stereotyped according to gender, for example, women might be considered more powerful than men because they could normally appear more organised and perfectionist. Indeed, several studies concerning leadership and the role of the leader, have demonstrated that some people have innate attitudes of a leader regardless of their gender. Some of those attitudes are related to active listening, emotional intelligence skills and great communication abilities. Thus, if effectively developed and fostered, those skills can support individuals to achieve higher roles in leadership and management.In the same way, the working experience also plays a crucial role in determining and further developing leadership skills. For example, a large number of women are still renouncing to their career paths in order to care for their families. Indeed, most of the women, apply for part-time roles which do not offer the opportunity to achieve a leadership role despite their abilities. For this reason, is difficult to affirm if women are better than men in leadership.To conclude, the role of a leader is shaped by innate characteristics and people's personalities regardless of their gender. Moreover, the poor presence of women employed in leadership roles does not create pieces of evidence to support such a point of view.; There is a need to realize that leadership is not dependent on gender, but there are many compelling reasons why some women make better leaders. One of the main reasons why women are regarded as effective leaders is their empathetic and cooperative leadership style. The whole debate about whether women are better leaders than men is very subtle and complex. It is about the culture, about the leadership styles and about the changing role of women in society. For example, Jacinda Ardern, former New Zealand Prime Minister, was praised all over the world for her empathy in the face of a terrorist attack and an outbreak of a flu epidemic. Her ability to communicate with different people and bring them together demonstrated how women can lead with emotional intelligence and thus earn trust and loyalty. Women, it has been shown, value teamwork and the inclusive nature of their communication, which engenders in their subordinates a sense of belonging and purpose. Women on the boards of Unilever and General Motors, which have had significant financial successes and the best company culture, indicate that there is a strong link between diversity and achieving better results. In addition, women may encourage greater diversity in decision-making. Consequently, the question of whether women are better leaders than men should be redirected towards the recognition that different leadership styles have their own unique advantages. However, it is important not to generalize and stereotype about leadership abilities based on gender. Effective leadership is based on a variety of traits, experiences and the ability to inspire and motivate others, which is not restricted to one gender. In conclusion, I agree that women often bring unique qualities to leadership roles, but it is important to discuss leadership based on individual abilities, rather than as a dichotomy between the sexes.
247;Write about the following topic.Some people feel that manufacturers and supermarkets have the responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging of goods. Others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Packing of goods has become a noticeable issue nowadays, especially in terms of environmental concerns and sustainable development of society. In order to reduce the amount of packaging, some people believe that manufacturers and supermarkets are more responsible for taking measures, while others insist that customers play a more critical role in reality. In my view, the effort needs to be made by the supplier and the consumer both to guarantee the achievement of the goal.On the one hand, the problem of over-packaging is often caused by commercial strategy. The supplier attempts to use beautiful packaging to make their products more attractive to customers. It is fairly easy to imagine that people would be more likely to choose a product decorated gorgeously than the same one with a plain appearance provided that there is thus no significant increase in price. Following that, producers would try to make every effort to obtain more competitive packaging for their products, which probably leads to excessive use of the wrap. Therefore, it is undoubtedly the duty of the producer to partake in reducing the amount of over-packaging by finding another way to improve the competitiveness of their products instead of merely attaching more value to their appearance.On the other hand, the behaviors of customers give rise to over-packaging as well. The more attention that people will pay to the appearance of goods, the more encouraged producers will be to exert themselves on wrapping. Moreover, the public awareness about the harmful influence of over-packaging is also profound in decreasing the amount of packaging. As customers take the problems caused by over-packaging into account, they would be more willing to purchase the goods with less packaging, which is a highly practical way to prevent producers from wrapping unduly.In conclusion, it is clear that suppliers and customers both are responsible for the trend of over-packaging. Therefore, the success of altering the situation needs the participation of them both.; Both views have merit and should be discussed. With the increase in consumption in today's society, the problem of reducing the use of excessive amounts of packaging has become increasingly important. Many companies are now using minimal and biodegradable packaging, which not only meets the needs of the consumers for an environment-friendly package, but also shows a commitment to corporate social responsibility. On the one hand, the producers and the shops are seen as the main culprits who are able to change this. They can reduce the use of excessive plastics and they can start to use biodegradable materials. This may change the customers' habits and expectations. On the other hand, the consumers themselves have a major role in this. Supermarkets can also support this by choosing to stock such products and by encouraging suppliers to work on more sustainable solutions. For example, when consumers prefer to buy products with little packaging, they will be a driving force for companies to adopt a more sustainable approach. The boom in zero-waste stores and other shops shows that consumers are looking for more sustainable alternatives. When consumers buy products with less packaging, they are giving a clear signal to the manufacturer and the shop that they prefer this. And consumer awareness and choice are invaluable allies. I think it's a shared responsibility, but it's up to the companies and the shops, since they have the resources and the ability to influence the whole chain. At the end of the day, a sustainable culture must be built together between both parties to achieve real change. A common solution, where consumers and businesses work together to reduce packaging, would have the greatest impact.
181;Write about the following topic.Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding change. Others, however, think that change is always a good thing.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people rather doing the same things over and over avoiding change, meanwhile others consider change as a positive thing. Some people are probably afraid of change and for this reason they prefer staying in the confort zone because it's something familiar. On the other hand, others believe that change is a good opportunity to grow and discover new things.Changing it's not for everybody, because there are people that doesn't like it, so they try to avoid it. Spending the whole life doing the same thing is not as bad as change for some people. This is probably linked to the fact that sometime change is something unknown. So, sometime people prefere to stay in their confort zone because even if it's not the best at least is something familiar. For example, people that hate their jobs but are stuck with it, is because they're too afraid to change it and land in a worse place or position. So they rather stay in that place because they're too afraid to lose it and end up worse. I believe that this is an understandable and common reason around people, however i believe that change can give more chances for improvement.Other people believes that change is always a positive thing. Changing is an opportunity to grow and discover new things, It's a chance to achieve something better and improve. There are people who doesn't like to be in the same place (phisically, economically or emotionally) and prefer changing. For instance, going to a new country because the idea of living in the same place forever is not charming enough, so find out new places to see, and places to feel confortable ,emotionally and economically for instance, is something that only people who are hungry enough of change would do it. I believe that sometime it's better risk it than live the same life everyday.In conclusion, the preference about change depends on people and wheter is beneficial or not depends on the different point of views and situations. I think, that change is important, everything change even if try to avoid it. So, it's better embrace it because no matter how things go it will leave you either with an experiece or with a lesson. So, in my opinion change is a good thing.; Some people prefer routine and stability and always do the same things. This approach makes them feel safe and secure and reduces the fear of the unknown. The debate between change and stability is a very old and philosophical issue and involves many fundamental questions about human nature and society. Others, however, argue that change is a necessary and inevitable part of life, and that people who accept it and adapt to it are more likely to grow and develop. For example, someone who has worked in the same job for decades may enjoy the relationship with his colleagues and the skills he has acquired. Stability can also lead to mastery and a deep sense of belonging. On the other hand, in a world that is constantly changing, especially with the development of technology and social trends, the ability to change is necessary for survival, both individually and collectively. Change requires individuals to step out of their comfort zone and accept new realities. This, in turn, requires us to be flexible, creative and resourceful, which is a vital skill for coping with the complexity of modern life. In my opinion, while there is value in stability, the advantages of change often outweigh the comforts of stability. In addition, change often leads to more rewarding and fulfilling life experiences and increases our understanding of ourselves and the world. The best thing may be a combination of both stability and change.
149;Write about the following topic.Some people think living in big cities is bad for people’s health.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In the past decades, the rise of urbanization has brought trends of moving into the cities. While some people believe that the availability of resources and welfare in metropolises can outweigh the unhealthy environment, I strongly believe that the fancy infrastructures come in exchange for health sacrifice.To begin with, most megacities are overpopulated. With scarce resources and higher demands in every aspect, products and services received in these bustling locations usually come at a higher price, lower quality and longer waiting time. For example, it could take up to weeks or months to queue up for non-urgent medical services while it takes only a few days or even without booking in non-busy areas. Moreover, the nature of crowded areas accelerates the spreading of transmittable diseases during the pandemic.Another undeniable health factor for those residing in cities is pollution. Most cities come with traffic issues where there are exceeding amounts of cars which create air pollution. It is proved that, in long term, smog in the air could result in respiratory diseases such as lung cancer. Furthermore, the number of the city's population is equal to the extremely large amount of waste and without an appropriate waste management system, it could lead to several more problems. One of them is pests such as mice and bugs which are the perfect mediums for severe diseases such as rabies.All in all, urbanization has tremendous benefits to human society as a whole and is unavoidable in the present context. Thus, governments should focus on addressing these issues to ensure the sustainable progress of cities and the citizens' quality of life.; The main problem of living in a city is that people are exposed to a lot of pollution. Although people do have some health problems in a city, I think the benefits of living in a city can outweigh the disadvantages as long as people make healthy choices. According to research, asthma and other lung diseases are more common in urban areas than in rural areas. High traffic and industrialization often cause poor air quality, which aggravates breathing problems and can also lead to other health problems. Besides, the city's fast pace can also lead to psychological problems such as anxiety and depression. For example, hospitals and specialist doctors are more concentrated in cities, ensuring timely and high-quality treatment. On the other hand, cities have superior medical facilities, diverse recreational opportunities and a variety of health-promoting services. Moreover, the integration of social resources and the community help to maintain mental health. In conclusion, although there are health problems in cities, the advantages of better medical care, more opportunities for physical activity and a supportive social environment can also make people live a healthier life. Most of the people in the city live close to a variety of restaurants offering healthy food. So with a better awareness of health, people can also benefit from the advantages of urban life.

This article will explain in fully with reasons why art should be taught for children in school .There is understading that reading , writing and mathematics are the most topics we should concentrate our children to learn during school time and that idea is somehow correct but , some subjects like art , music and potery also play pivotal rolein our life however , speaking of art for instance , scientists claim that art can show creativity of child and help teachers to guide them to talented children , furthermore, children are different to show their expression , some of them find a better way in art to express their feelings and that will help teachers and even parents for better understanding for their children , also this way will help children to strenghten their confidence during study .To conclude , although as a general perception for some parents that the main purpose to send their children to the school is to learn reading , writing , math and other sciences , there is understaing that time also should be given to other topics like art in order to figure out and use skills that children have .; Both views have some value, but to reach a rounded opinion it is important to examine the various aspects of art education. A major argument in favour of art in schools is that it develops creativity and self-expression. Art can help children to develop their imaginations and, therefore, help them to think outside the box. On the other hand, those who are against art education argue that schools should devote more time to subjects such as mathematics and science which are considered more important for future success. They argue that time spent on art would take away from these subjects and thus affect the students’ academic performance and future job prospects. There is also some evidence that schools with a high level of art education have higher levels of student engagement and that students feel happier. According to my opinion, although it is necessary to put a high priority on the core subjects, we should not forget the value of art education. Art plays a fundamental role in the development of the whole person, as it develops emotional intelligence and critical thinking. This is especially true in today’s highly competitive job market, where skills in the STEM subjects are highly valued. This is because art is a part of the whole learning experience, not just the study of one subject. Many studies have shown a positive correlation between art education and higher academic achievement. This could be because the process of learning itself is so much more than the learning of a single subject. In conclusion, a well-balanced curriculum including both art and the core subjects would ultimately have the most positive impact on the student’s future success.
221;Write about the following topic.Some people think that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is believed that responsibility for the rise in obesity in children is on government. I strongly disagree with this opinion. I think that state policy cannot lead to the people's obesity. Moreover, I am sure that only parents are responsible for their children diseases.First of all, it is important to say that government's actions can not be followed with the obesity. It is responsible only for control that all available products are not dangerous for people's health. Food that consist of a lot of fats do not put your health under the threat after the first consumption. Only overeating of this kind of food can be harmful for your health leading obesity. For instance, there is no government's responsibility if you go to the mall and buy 6 cans of beer providing health problem for yourself. I am sure that government is responsible only for making 1 can of beer acceptable for your health.Secondly, children's actions and potential consequences of these actions should be controlled by their parents. Obesity can be a result of a permanent overeating. Because of their age, chilldren cannot control themselves. That is why this responsibility goes on their parents. As it was mentioned before, there is no product that can be harmful for the healh after the first and the only consumption. There is no reason to condemn government because of the permanent consumption of any products. For example, child could eat 3 pieces of cake insted of 1 just because of his wish. In this case, his parents should stop him after the first one to avoid potential obesity.In conclusion, I would like to say that I do not see any reasons to say that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children. It has no responsibility for people's overeating and lack of parents' control over their children.; I agree with the statement that the government is responsible for the increase in childhood obesity. The increasing rate of childhood obesity has become a serious public health issue in many countries. The main reason for this is that government policies encourage children to eat unhealthy food in the home. In many regions, unhealthy foods such as candy, sweets and fast food are widely available and aggressively marketed to children. Food advertising, especially advertising to children, could be more limited. This is because the government’s role in school education can also affect the children’s lifestyle. For example, government subsidies for sports, where children can learn new skills, can be reduced due to budget cuts. Hence children can have fewer opportunities to develop their bodies. Furthermore, government policies on urban planning can affect the availability of healthy food. For example, schools that focus on testing, rather than physical education, can indirectly promote children’s sedentary lifestyles and increase the likelihood of obesity. In conclusion, while individual choices and lifestyles play a role in childhood obesity, the government’s role in creating an environment in which children live, eat and play is undeniable. In many cities, “food deserts” where no fresh fruit or vegetables are available, and families have to rely on fast food or corner stores for healthy food, can encourage unhealthy eating habits. On the other hand, the government’s encouragement of local businesses to open a grocery store or build a park could encourage people to adopt a healthy diet. Thus, by strengthening government regulations on the food industry, promoting physical education and improving access to healthy food, the government can make a major contribution to the prevention of childhood obesity and a healthier future generation.
565;Write about the following topic.Some people think that it is more beneficial to take part in sports which are played in teams, like football. But others think taking part in individual sports is better, like swimming. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"There are lots of benifits in both party of sports which is group sports and individual sports. Many argue that one is better than another. By analyzing my personal experience, both side advantages and disadvanteges will be discussed.Health, the main factor that make people doing the sport in some extent. Many sports help body to increase the metabolism and keep our figure look slim. For example, like swiming, the sport is well-known for beauty body buidling, many reaserch show that water pressure form muscle into more dynamic beautiful shape than any other sport regardless of safty issues which part of events were practice in open water.Compare to swiming, a group sport like soccer game need 22 players participate into the field. Average soccer player have very powerful core strenth, in order to compete in this match, soccer player need to wear certain protection to prevent from injury such as foot pad to reduce the impact from side kick from other players and ankel protector. Undoubtly, soccer players have most strong body among many sports. However, they are the group of people most likely get injuryed more frequently.Sport also can build trust and friendship between people. In this aspect, both individual sports and group sports are proven that partipating in group games or competing with another player on a 1v1 match can increase the improvement of sportsmanship between people. Like olympic motto, ""stonger, faster and higher"", a good sport can bring people together and compete each other in a fair and friendly enviornment. However, individual sport may get boring faster than group sports due to lack of competition.In conclusion, neither group sports nor individual sports are perfect in every aspects. It is important to found a sport suit for each individual personal interest. All kinds of sports always carry benifits with dangerous if people do not do it well."; Sports are an important part of life for many people. They help people to stay healthy, mentally and physically. There are two main types of sports, team sports like football and individual sports like swimming. Team sports are said to have a positive effect on the personality of the players, e.g. they learn to work together, and communication skills are developed. On the other hand, individual sports can develop self-reliance and help to achieve personal goals. Supporters of individual sports argue that these activities help to be responsible and disciplined. Support from the team is also very strong and keeps people motivated and responsible. Individual sports, such as swimming, are more based on personal achievement and people often feel a greater sense of personal achievement. In individual sports, like swimming, the person has to depend on his own skills and efforts for success. This independence can develop discipline and a strong sense of responsibility. In my opinion, both types of sports have their advantages and disadvantages. It is clear that some people prefer team sports and some like individual sports. A variety of sports can enrich one's life and can provide both social and personal growth. Finally, this choice depends on the individual's goals and values. Perhaps the best solution would be to take part in both types of sports and thus achieve personal development and the most pleasure.
189;Write about the following topic.Some people think that we should divide students based on their academic ability, while others think we should educate all students together. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people argue that students who have noticeable abilities and nice educational skills in academics should be separated during the learning process. The other says that it is no object who a better in education who not they should study together. I believe that it is terrible idea to include separation among students.On the one hand, when students with strong and weak academic abilities educate separately, teachers could control the learning process more thoroughly. In this way the teacher could give them more difficult tasks and focus on really relevant topics. A good example of this are private schools with fees and entering exams. It is the fact that there students in final classes have better knowledge than in common schools.On the other hand, when students with different skills educate together the strong students will help weak ones. In these classes there are standards and all students should follow them and there are opportunities to ask schoolmates how to solve some task correctly. The nice example of this is my school. If I did not know how to solve a task I would have a chance to wait for help from my more wise mate.In conclusion, although separate education will give a chance to learn a lot of difficult tasks and it helps teachers, the losing way of asking help if you do not know how to solve the task would be devastating for the educational process. In addition, it could be separated by abilities and wisdom, anyway it is an awful idea.; This is a controversial issue that has good arguments on both sides. People who think that dividing students by academic ability makes it possible to give them more tailored education, which means that teachers can prepare lessons for students of different abilities. There are more advantages than disadvantages for this, because gifted children can move at a faster pace and get more attention from teachers, and slower learners can learn without the stress of competition with more advanced ones. On the other hand, people who think it is better to mix the abilities of students say that it creates a social environment where students from different backgrounds share their views and work together. For example, gifted students could learn calculus, but in remedial classes they would learn how to do basic arithmetic. As a result, there is evidence that children of different abilities encourage and motivate each other. The learning of the slowest student can be promoted by the presence of the most advanced, and vice versa. In my opinion, it is the best solution to combine both ways. The most important thing is that it is possible to develop important life skills such as cooperation and communication outside the school environment. One way to achieve this is to encourage a learning environment that encourages both academic excellence and social skills that can prepare children for life, not just tests. It is clear that dividing the advanced and slow learners can be advantageous for both, but total segregation can hurt the feelings of slow learners and lead to the inflated ego of gifted ones.
569;Write about the following topic.Some teachers think that international student exchange would be beneficial for all teenage school students.Do you think its advantages will outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The international student exchange is getting more popular in many high schools in big cities. This operation brings many advantages which would be beneficial for teenager students. Though, here some disadvantages still exist.Firstly, I think one of disadvantages is that lack of supervision on the international exchange teenagers as they are living in other countries. In general speaking, the youths felt strange and inadaptable at initial period. They can’t speak well foreign language, can’t communicate well with other classmates or teachers, so they might feel alone and isolate from a new circumstance. If they can’t adjust themselves well to fit in with groups as soon as possible, they will encounter more difficult things, such as studying, social and daily routine. The worse situation is that they might give up their studying, even they will mislead them into crime.On the contrary, the advantages are far more than disadvantages. For example, youths will extend their horizons. They will see and know many new things what they never seen in domestic. They would easily accept those new things than adults, because youths have curiosities all long. Furthermore, the teenagers easier to make new friends in other countries, because they are always passion and single-minded. In order to communicate with different background students from all over the world, they must cultivate their social capacities harder than before. It is the best way to elevate their skills of the foreign language is communication. Moreover, through the different viewpoint collisions the international exchange students have gained multiple and scientific logics, which will have a profound impact at the rest their lives. However, I think the simplest advantage is that most the international exchange students have possessed with an excellent foreign language ability after then come back.At the end of my essay, I think it is not suit for all teenagers to be the international exchange students. Here the teenagers must accept some selection processes under the fair and effective principles.; In the recent past, international student exchange has received widespread support from educators as a tool for learning. Although the benefits may outweigh the disadvantages, I believe that the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages. Especially one of the most powerful benefits is that students are more open to foreign culture. In other words, an American student who studies in Japan not only learns the language but also learns the custom of bowing, tea ceremony, and collectivism in society. Exposure to such a culture can help students to understand and appreciate the diversity of people and increase their social and communication skills. In addition, students learn to grow up more independently because they are in a strange environment, so they have to cope with unfamiliar things and overcome problems. Moreover, students learn to respect and understand other people's cultures, which is essential for today's interconnected world. However, some critics argue that students who travel abroad can become homesick and become disoriented, which may have a negative effect on academic performance. On the other hand, a high school student who lives in France for a year has to learn to communicate with others in spite of the language barrier, make new friends, and live independently, which increases his confidence and prepares him for the complexities of adult life. In conclusion, the benefits of international student exchange programs such as cultural understanding, personal growth, and global awareness far outweigh the disadvantages. However, it is also important to understand that these disadvantages are part of the learning process. Adapting to such obstacles and difficulties can ultimately make students more flexible and capable of overcoming future difficulties. In this way, international student exchange plays a crucial role in preparing students for a society that is becoming more and more interconnected.
1003;Write about the following topic.Some universities now offer their courses on the Internet so that people can study online.Is this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It has become a popular trend that many universities have sent online courses for people to acquire knowledge through the Internet, which makes it more and more available for people to gain valuable resources and improve themselves. From my perspective, such a trend contains much benefits and it is undoubtedly a positive development.On the one hand, people can have more access to their interested expertise and delve into related fields with the help of online courses offered by universities. It is comparatively hard and inconvenient for people to attend courses in the university if they are not college students. Luckily, with myriads of online courses which are usually free and of high quality, learners merely need to register and sign in to find out some interesting courses ranging from academic knowledge to practical skills, which can afford a challenging but exciting experience for those attend the lessons.On the other hand, it is a good way for the universities to improve the quality of the courses as well as make some adaptation to the content of the courses. In order for people outside the universities to acquire knowldege effectively, online courses should cater to people's preference to some extent. It is expectable that some courses which is of great necessity and closely connected with people's daily life would be popular. Thus, universities would therefore release more high-quality courses by innovating teaching skills to meet people's needs.In conlusion, I think online courses provided by universities can surely make a positive impact on society because people who have the desire to acquire knowledge can enjoy sufficient resources without boundaries, which enhances individual's rights to grasp knowledge and facilitates the improvement of higher education in the long run.; This development in education is facilitated by the advances in technology, which provide a number of advantages that make education more accessible and flexible. The main advantage of the university is the convenience. To take the example of a student in a developing country, they can now participate in the same courses as well-known universities in the United States or Europe without having to move. Because the Internet has broken down the boundaries of the traditional college, it is now possible for students in different parts of the world to get access to good and prestigious courses. This is especially advantageous for working people who want to update their skills or change their career without having to leave their jobs. The flexibility of the course is also an advantage of studying on the Internet. You can set the course to suit your own life, making it easier to combine studying with other responsibilities. However, one should also note that studying on the Internet can be difficult because there is less contact with teachers and classmates, which can affect motivation and learning. Fortunately, many courses have elements such as virtual classrooms and discussion forums that help to counteract these disadvantages. For example, a full-time employee can now study in the evening or on the weekend, which makes education more accessible. As technology develops further, it will become even more possible to design and participate in an exciting and challenging online learning environment that will help countless people around the world. To conclude, the development of the Internet is a positive development that opens up access to knowledge and adapts to the diverse needs of learners.
531;Write about the following topic.The issue of gay marriage remains controversial. Some people think that this trend has adverse effects on the society while others believe that it is seen as a natural trend and right for people to choose this type of marriage. Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Recently, many countries have legalized gay marriage. However, there are many people who do not agree with that, and claim that it has a bad influence on the education of children, and the evolution of society. However, in my opinion, I think it is a good opportunity for homosexual people as they are now understood by others, and have the right to have children despite of their situation.To begin, there are many parents, for example, who tend to believe that because of the access to gay marriage, their children will find it normal to fall in love with a person from the same sex. As a result, more and more children will become homosexual, which is unconventional as far as the parents are concerned. However, I believe that it is not because children understand the fact that being gay is normal, that they will be influenced by this. In fact, they will be able to compassionate for people who struggle to express their homosexuality, so they will help them to feel more comfortable with that. Moreover, they will be more open-minded which is very important for children development.Secondly, many other people are convinced that gay marriage will inevitably tends towards a decrease of the young population as gay individuals can not have their own kids. As a consequence, This phenomenon represents a threat because young people will not be able to take over for the future. However, I am not of this opinion. I think that such a decrease in young people population will not occur as the vast majority of the world's population in not homosexual. Moreover, by allowing gay marriage, gay couples will be able to adopt children. Indeed, due to the fact that they are not able to give rise to new-born, they can adopt children who are abandonned, and give them the opportunity to live in a new family with good conditions.To conclude, I firmly believe that gay marriage is a good opportunity for the development of the society. Indeed, not only it makes children more open-minded, which is important for their own development, but also gives for those who are unfortunately abandonned, a safe environment to thrive in.; I am firmly convinced that gay marriage should be legalized because it can promote equality, foster social cohesion and show how society is evolving. The issue of gay marriage remains one of the most controversial topics of contemporary society. Some people argue that gay marriage has negative consequences for the society while others advocate it as a natural development and fundamental right for people to choose their spouses. In a democratic society, it is imperative that all individuals have the right to marry a person of the same gender. To deny the same-gender couple this right violates the principle of equality and damages the principles of justice and fairness. First, gay marriage demonstrates the principle of equality. Marriage is a legal framework that offers various protections and advantages, such as access to health care, inheritance rights, and social security benefits. Furthermore, legalizing gay marriages will stabilize families and society as a whole. Various studies have shown that the introduction of gay marriage in countries such as the Netherlands and Canada resulted in more acceptance of gay people and less discrimination. In addition, attitudes towards gay marriages are changing and people are becoming more aware of the rights of homosexual people. The existence of a stable family will bring many benefits to the society as a whole because they will be emotionally and socially supportive. For example, the government will not have to support all these couples who have no money or help to provide for themselves and their children. Moreover, in the modern world, many young people see gay relationships as a natural and normal phenomenon that should be respected and legally protected.
293;Write about the following topic.The most important function of music is that it helps people reduce stress. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many today have come to the conclusion that the most significant effect on people of music is to relieve stress. While I agree that music also has more important positive functions other than reducing stress.On the one hand, I have to admit that music is a good way to reduce stress and it do plays an important role in our daily life. A good example of this can be seen in Shanghai, where has a large number of single karaoke rooms in the office buildings. As we all know, compared to the others cities in China, the people living in Shanghai face more stress, like the surprisingly high price of house and the fierce competition of work. Those public karaoke rooms, which were provided by the government for the public, become a good place for people to enjoy the music and have fun.On the other hand, for many people, music is an ideal career to persue in their life, like the job as an accountant, which can bring them with incomes and improve their living standard. For example, the TV programs related to music attract more and more people to participate in, like The Voice. Most of the participants wish to show their excellent peformance in music through these stages with the purpose of having access to more business opportunities and making more money at the same time. It is undeniable that the following income would be exponential increased than before if they succeed finally.In conclusion, it is not doubt that music is very essential for us, not only for its spiritual meanings, but also for its more important role in our society which could allow the person to relise their dream while creating more economical benefits.; I think it is not wrong to agree with the above statement, because I am sure that this function of music has a significant role in the mental health of people and that it offers not only a way to escape from daily problems, but also a means of expressing emotions. A study has shown that listening to classical and ambient music can lower cortisol levels, a stress hormone, and make people less anxious in a difficult situation. First, music is known to have a physiological effect on the human brain. When it comes to music, it can also offer emotional relief through lyrics and musical structures. For example, when I was faced with the academic pressure during the exam, I often played piano music and this helped me to reduce my anxiety and focus on my studies. As a result, it creates an emotional connection that can improve mental health. Besides the emotional experience of individualism, music is also a way of creating social relationships that reduce stress. For example, in the midst of difficult times, anthems of steadfastness and resilience are often powerful allies to remind people that they are not alone in their struggle. In addition, the collective energy of singing together has a profound effect on mood and anxiety. In conclusion, although music has many functions, the most important one is to reduce stress. Its psychological and physiological benefits make it an important part of our lives. When we consciously accept music as a means of reducing stress, we are more healthy and happy, so it is a part of our humanity.
925;Write about the following topic.The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Traffic in cities is now a major public health problem. Finding solutions to reduce traffic is very crucial. I totally agree that if people travel less from home to work or to education or even for shopping can reduce the amount of traffic. With the covid 19 outbreak pandemic we saw how much the working from home and using the zoom application for studying reduced the traffic in cities. People now are using online for shopping too. We know that traffic can be reduced if less consumers are using the roads. However, I dont agree that this is the only way to reduce traffic. Other strategies to reduce traffic are :1. Planning the roads and building the road bridges in a smarter way with special lanes for public transportation.2. Encourging people to use light trails, public transportations and to use car pools.3. Building special lanes for motorcycles and electric bikes.4. The governoment can put more regulations regarding how many cars each family can have.5. Increasing the vehicles prices and reduce the public transportation tickets.6. Educate people on the consequences of traffic and how it can inadverntly affect their life.7. Encourge people to walk more and to choose a work that is close to your home.As I mentioned above there are many strategies that can help in reducing tranffic and only by reducing the need for people to travel from home. I think i people travel less it abviously can reduce the traffic but we need a multi strategy with the collaberations of many sectors to successfly reduce traffic in cities.; A new perspective has arisen on the solution of the congestion of traffic in cities. In the last few years, the congestion of the streets has increased a lot, especially in those countries where the population has grown a lot and economic activity has grown. On the one hand, the daily trip of employees to work from home could be significantly reduced by introducing new working methods. During the influenza pandemic in Covid 19, the employees of the Bank of England managed to work from home and this was profitable for the Bank of England, on the other hand, they saved on transportation costs. On the other hand, the number of vehicles on the roads could be reduced by increasing the local activity of goods and services. For example, the establishment of local colleges or vocational schools would improve the local education and thus reduce the need to go to large cities for education, while the development of local markets and shops would improve the local availability of goods and services without requiring long trips. Also, the development of public transport, carpooling and the development of cycling and walking should be encouraged in order to reduce the amount of vehicles on the roads. Cities like Amsterdam, for example, have shown that a solid bicycle network can balance the lack of mobility and the reduction of traffic in cities. With this multi-pronged approach, cities could achieve a more sustainable future and the citizens of the city could benefit from it.
235;Write about the following topic.There are several factors that motivate people to stay in the workforce, and money is the most important reason/factor. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The topic of motivation for work has merely failed to be discussed. Someone elaborate that the most significant factor is money while others suppose it is not. As far as I am concerned, although money is of great importance, it cannot always be the most valuable one.Undoubtedly, money can be a crucial factor to diminish the financial burden of families, especially for those who were born in a poverty-stricken area. To be more specific, only by earning sufficient money can they raise their later generations and keep the elderly. Provided that they cannot find a decent job that allow them to own some disposable money, it would add insult to injury.However, there are a great number of factors that may be considered as worthwhile to be the motivation of stay in the staff by some people. First of all, being in the workforce can help to strengthen an individual’s interpersonal skills. It is widely acknowledged that there are a colossal number of activities as well as team programmes that require people to collaborate, compromise and compete with the others. Thus, individuals will tend to learn some social skills and become gregarious and sociable, which can help them better adapt themselves to the mainstream society. In addition, people may also get a chance to broaden their horizons and lay a firm basis for future development by staying in the workforce. For instance, under the circumstance that numerous companies may provide the staff with the opportunity to go abroad and get involved in some international programs, people are able to get access to different cultures. As a result, people can develop panning-for-gold thinking rather than sponge-feeding thinking in the process of understanding divergent cultures, which can be beneficial for their future careers.In conclusion, although money is valuable for individuals to be in the workforce, there are many other factors that cannot be overlooked. Only by treating all the factors rationally can we enjoy the pleasure rather than pressure.; Certainly, money is a necessity of survival and provides the means for security. But while money is an important factor for staying in the workforce, it is not the only one. In my opinion, while financial compensation is important, there are many other things, such as job satisfaction, career advancement, work-life balance, and a sense of meaning, that can motivate people to stay. In certain industries, where salaries are substantially higher, such as finance or technology, it is understandable that compensation is a priority. However, other factors should not be ignored. A salary that is competitive and fair can attract and keep good people, because it allows them to achieve their personal goals and maintain a certain standard of living. For example, doctors and nurses often cite the opportunity to help others as the main reason for their work, which sometimes outweighs salary. A sense of meaning and fulfilment from a job can also be an important motivator. Work-life balance is also an important priority for many people. The opportunity for advancement is another way to keep people in the workforce. A company that encourages development and growth can inspire loyalty from employees who aspire to greater things. In conclusion, while money is important, it is not the only reason for people to stay in the workforce. In an age of mental health awareness, employees are increasingly seeking out work-life balance, and will accept lower pay if it means a healthy balance between their work and personal life. Having a policy that addresses all these issues is essential for companies that wish to retain their employees.
115;Write about the following topic.To meet the growing need for food to support an increasing population, a country should make use of edible insects as a food source. However, some people believe that insects are not only unhealthy but harvesting them will also negatively affect nature. What are the benefits and drawbacks of eating insects?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some countries and culture already utilize insects as part of food source. As such, it can be relatively inexpensive to consume insects - which are often freely found in certain environments and do not take much skill to be collected, killed and consumed - as compared to the cost and manual labor involved in raising animal livestock, butchering, as well as preparing the meat for consumption. Similarly agriculture also involves consistent manual labor, and has costs associated with it, including for machinery and materials needed. However, people may be against the idea of consuming insects due to the novelty of it, and they may also feel disgust around it. As the prompt states, some may find it unhealthy. Harvesting insects on purpose will also require some physical and psychological work - but the benefit here is that it may be easier than harvesting large animals or cultivating crops.I have never consumed an insect product - and my father has mentioned to me that had lived in such-and-such country, I would not be so scared of cockroaches - viewing them as a food source. He intended this to be an ironic comment, meant to comfor me somewhat due to my strong aversion to cockroaches. However, he may be correct! For individuals socialized in such a society, their aversion to roaches may be lower than mine. Hence, part of the issue here is socialization and accepting this new food norm, should it be novel to the individual and/or the country.I have tried an octopus for the first time when I was around 20 years old - as I was curious about this dish called Takoyaki, and had heard good reviews of it. It was not unpleasant to eat the ocotpus, per se, but I likely will not go back to it. All in all, new experiences, including consumption of new types of food, may create strong aversion at first, but once dip your toes into it, so to speak, it may be tamer than the experience you were expecting - even if you never go back to eating it again.; This is an essay on the benefits and drawbacks of eating insects. As the world's population increases, the question of how to feed a growing population has become a pressing issue. An obvious solution is to increase the consumption of insects as food. For example, crickets are about 60% of the total weight of the body, which is more than the weight of beef or chicken. One of the main benefits of eating insects is that they are rich in nutrients, vitamins and minerals, which can be used to replace the loss of nutrients in beef and chicken. Eating insects can also reduce the impact on the environment. For example, a kilogram of crickets will produce only 0.1 kilograms of carbon dioxide per kilogram of beef. There are also concerns about the safety of eating insects. Inappropriate harvesting or production methods can lead to contamination of harmful bacteria or toxins. Also, the effects of harvesting insects on the environment are of concern. The imbalance in the local environment can lead to the extinction of certain species. Besides, some countries may not accept the change in their eating habits. I hope that in the future we can find a balance between the benefits and drawbacks of eating insects, and strive to build a food system that can feed a growing population. In the end, although the consumption of insects has a very good nutritional value and is a green food source, there are still some problems that must be solved before we can realize this potential.
131;Write about the following topic.With the improvements in today’s health care, society has to care for more and more elderly people.Do you feel that society will be able to cope with the increase in numbers of elderly people today and how can it be managed?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;I believe that all improvements in health care increase the number of elderly people, but those improvements also brings benefities in an way to care then.First of all, looking for a financial perspective, in generaly way, people became capable to work for a bigger period, getting retired older. So they could contributed more for any pension plan or those kind of program. We need to guarantee that our next governants will be capable to redesign the retire's program in an way to guarantee those beneffits to whole population.Looking by a health care perspective, all the improvments and medicine advance, it brings the possibilite to have a good life even allthough the years.For instance, we can see many people that healed from a bad ill like cancer or other ones and have a good life nowadays.This is the reason that elderly people is not a problem to our society, but in fact their represents more knowledge and we have all tecnology to take care about theirselfs.In other way we can see that our society open more space and are more concern with elderly population. We can see some places speciallyzed to take care of their and also a kind of intertainement focused on them, like some hotels, restauurants, clinics.In whole way our society are looking for treaty our elderly society in a decent way, respect them, make a enviroment friendly for their deficient and any dificult of mobility and any other issue that we need to cope to guarantee their activities.; One of the major issues is that of the healthcare system. While medical progress has led to a sharp increase in life expectancy, it has also put tremendous strain on society, because of the needs of the elderly. For example, according to the CDC, seniors are at greater risk of developing diabetes and heart disease, and these are conditions that require constant medical care. This is especially true since the number of patients with chronic illnesses is increasing. The solution to this is to increase spending on the care of the elderly, to train more physicians and nurses, and to increase services in the community, such as home care, in order to reduce the burden on hospitals and nursing homes. In addition, a greater emphasis on preventive medicine is required, and public health education is essential. Finally, intergenerational programs in the community can help both the young and the old. These can serve as social networks for the elderly and help them avoid isolation. Another solution is to implement telemedicine, which would reduce the need for the elderly to travel and would be less expensive. In the end, though the increase in the elderly population may pose a challenge to society, a thoughtful response to the problem will result in an even stronger support system for all ages. For example, a mentorship program in schools can enrich both the young and the old.
933;Write about the following topic.Young people in the modern world seem to have more power and influence than any previous young generation.Why is this the case?What impact does this have on the relationship between old and young people?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"In modern times, the younger generation appear to be more powerful and influencial compared to the generations in times past. I believe this is as a result of younger people being more ascertive, stepping up to question and change existing societal norms and archaic cultures. At first, this may negatively affect their relationship with the older generation as a result of how unfamiliar they are to these changes but subsequently, the tension is bound to resolve, when the older generations come to accept these changes.To begin with, it is an open truth that young people these days tend to be very bold and outspoken and unlike their predecessors, are better at questioning norms that do not sit right with them and even going an extra mile to change these norms or cultures. A good example of this is seen in women empowerment and rights activism. In my part of the world, some years back, it was believed that a woman's place is in the kitchen and her sole job was to birth and rear children, therefore, women were not allowed to be educated or have paying jobs. Women in the older generation complied to this because it was the norm, but this is not the case in modern times, because many young women opposed to it and now, homes are even headed by women; the power of activism.Many people in the older generation are not familiar with young people being more outspoken and this is understandable because in their time, they were taught to only follow rules and not to question them. Therefore the fact that young people have become more outspoken and powerful is foreign to them and just like every human nature, whatever is foreign or different is automatically hated. As a result, there is likely going to be a tension between the 2 generations, however, with constant advocation and learning the tension is bound to resolve. For example, going back to women's rights activism, at the start, many older people were not on board as they did not think it was normal, however, there are now a lot of older people who have become activists.In conclusion, I believe that the power and influence the younger generation has is as a result of their ascertiveness and will to effect changes in their societies and even though it may cause a negative relationship with the older generation at first, subsequently, their differences is likely to be ironed out when the older generation learns to accept these changes."; The first reason is that the Internet and social media have revolutionized how young people communicate and organize themselves. Second, the Internet and social media have changed the way young people communicate and organize. Third, the media play an important role in shaping the way young people think and act. Fourth, access to a wealth of information has helped young people engage with complex issues. Instagram, TikTok and Twitter allow young people to spread their ideas and organize their actions on a global scale. The Black Lives Matter and school strike movements show how young people can lead and take action, and through the Internet they can reach millions of people in an instant and get them to support their causes. As a result, the young generation is tackling issues such as mental health, a taboo subject only a few years ago. They can learn about all sorts of issues, from social justice to environmental issues, from a young age, which gives them a greater sense of responsibility for society. Fifth, the impact of this new power on the relationship between the old and the young is complex. On the one hand, it can create conflict between old and young, as older people feel threatened and intimidated by young activists and their disregard for traditional values. However, this conflict can also lead to new ideas and more equality in society. On the other hand, the influence of young people can be used as a bridge to encourage communication and collaboration between the two generations. If they can bring the old and young together, they can both grow and ultimately society will be the winner. In conclusion, young people today have more power and influence than any previous generation.
351;Write about the following topic:In many countries, not enough students study science subjects. What are the causes? What will be the effect on society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, there are many courses available to take, from arts that include theatre and music to scientific topics such as mathemathics, physics, chemistry, biology and medicine. There is an evidence that the amount of students willing to learn science subjects is not sufficient. In this essay I will discuss the causes of the issue and the possible effect on society.There are several casues for the fact that students tend to skip science subjects. First, studying science can be hard and exhausting. The complexity of some subjects such as math and physics requires from the student to study many hours at home. Secondly, there are students who do not only find those courses difficult, but also get low marks even after studying long hours. As for chemistry classes, some courses include labratory lessons which may not appeal to some students.The importance of people having knowledge in science is great. The society relies on science on a daily basis. For instance, doctors who study medicine, must know mathematics, biology and chemistry well, because biology is relevant to the patient's body. In addition, doctors prescribe medications so they must know chemistry well. Another example is architects whose job is to plan and design buildings. Without a proper knowledge in physics, they could not plan buildings.Discussing those facts, studying science can be challenging. However, it is vital for the society that students will study science. Without doctors, nurses, scientists and other professions that rely on science, the health of the society might be effected negatively.; You may wish to discuss two or three causes in general terms and give your opinion. One of the main causes of the low interest in science subjects is the belief that they are difficult and boring. This attitude can be caused by a number of factors, and its effect on society can be significant. It can be further aggravated by the fact that many educational systems emphasize recitation of facts over critical thinking and practical application. Students who find subjects like physics, chemistry, and biology difficult are often intimidated and frightened, especially when they find out that they do not know the subject well enough to work on their own. Another cause is that people often think that jobs in the field of art, humanities, and business are more prestigious and better paid than scientific jobs. For example, in schools that are underfunded, students may have fewer opportunities to see and experience the practical applications of scientific discoveries, so it may be difficult for them to appreciate the excitement and practicality of scientific work. Furthermore, some societies place less emphasis on the importance of scientific subjects than others, and this can also deter students from pursuing a career in science, especially if they do not feel encouraged by parents and teachers. The effect of this on society can be very large. Science is needed for the development of technology, and a shortage of scientists, engineers, and other technical staff could seriously impede the progress of society. Generally speaking, the low interest in scientific subjects can lead to the lowering of innovation and technological advancement, both of which are needed to address some of the major challenges of our time: climate change, health problems, and economic security. To overcome these obstacles, it is necessary to make the learning environment more attractive and encouraging for the sciences. The consequence for society can be damaging and inhibit innovation.
1185;Write about the following topic:Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Poverty has been always a major issue around the world. Due to viruses, natural disasters, and poor management in the country and overpopulation, each day the poverty increases. In addition, some developed countries ignore the help or just give a temporary solution. Poverty has a great effect on the income that can lead to serious problems.To begin with, developed countries shouldn't only support with financial aid, as that kind of solution will not help the people. In my opinion, rich countries can stop poverty in such way to look for the natural resources of the poor country and to help and develop its resources. For example, in Africa they are famous for their large area of land. A rich country can take this opportunity to implement a long-term plan to benefit and fight poverty, such as to start expanding the lands of agriculture to use their natural resources such as cocoa, rice, and coffee. Furthermore, this idea can also help the people of the country where they can work on the land and be employed.Also, developed countries can donate and build health care centers and schools to prevent the dangerous disease from spreading. Schools can empower children to grow up and help the country's economy to rise and to fight poverty.In conclusion, developed countries can unite and discuss this significant concern rather than helping with financial support as poverty is taking the lives of many children. Poor countries just need better solutions and understanding from the world to prevent such problems from continuing to happen.; I agree that developed countries should consider other forms of help, because financial help alone can lead to dependant growth without providing long-term solutions. The problem of poverty in developing countries is a complex one, and although the rich countries' financial help is helpful, it does not always bring sustainable results. If it is constantly dependent on aid from outside, it can hinder self-sufficiency. In Africa, for example, a large proportion of foreign aid to some African countries has been lost through corruption, so that there has been little improvement in living conditions for the population. Education, for example, can provide people with the right skills for the labour market and raise their incomes over time. Projects such as Teach For All or cooperation with local educational institutions can help to create a more qualified workforce and promote economic growth. In addition, developed countries can provide more direct help in the form of education and vocational training, which can help the local population to become more self-sufficient. In conclusion, although financial help can provide short-term help, it is often not enough to resolve the complex problem of poverty. On the other hand, the development of transport and communication systems, access to medical care and the introduction of new technology can help to create an environment in which businesses can grow and employees can be hired, which can help to reduce poverty. In short, by helping to provide education and building skills and local systems, rather than providing money, developed countries can help to break the cycle of poverty and reduce the long-term impact of aid.
343;Write about the following topic:Some people believe that it is important to spend a lot of money on family celebrations. While others think it is a waste of money. Discuss both views.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Spending money in family celebrations can be seen as a way of appreciating where one comes from. Although some people say it is a total waste of money, l assert that it is wiser.To begin with, many people feel that it is of no importance to consume money on family gatherings. This is because people usually have more pressing issues in life like urgent health cases that require money. Also, some struggle to provide basic needs for their families, for example, tuitions, decent meals and shelter. For these reasons, it seems using money on family gatherings is just a luxury.Despite the merits of the arguments above, although many say it is wasteful to financially cater for family parties, l assert that it is crucial. One reason is that, it unites families and a sweet spirit is maintained if family members are recognised for their special days such as wedding anniversaries, birthdays and graduations where money is spent. Further, appreciation to others within the family cannot be expressed in many ways without forking out some money.Furthermore, money has to be spent on family get togethers where everyone is in a joyous mood so that people can catch up and release stresses from their straining personal lives. What is more, culture, closeness and love is easily displayed when families come together for such celebrations and use money for their own satisfaction. For instance, when my childhood birthdays were celebrated, l felt so much loved and l still cherish the memories as l vividly can recall.To conclude, although others feel that it is money consuming to fund family gatherings, l advocate that it is a wiser option. Should this be the case, love within families would not wax cold and family members would feel more appreciated.; The spending of a large amount of money on family celebrations is a controversial issue. On one hand, people see the celebrations as a way of creating family bonds and, on the other hand, they see the waste of money. I think that family celebrations, such as birthdays, anniversaries and holidays, not only create family ties, but also leave a happy memory that the family can cherish for a long time. Moreover, it is an opportunity to get to know new members of the family and enrich the family atmosphere. On the other hand, those who do not like to spend a lot of money on family celebrations consider that such an event is frivolous and misses the true essence of a family gathering. They prefer smaller family gatherings that are more aimed at communication than decorations and abundance. These views are based on individual values and financial positions. In their view, a smaller gathering can be as beneficial to the family as a big party and spending the money saved on more important things or on savings for the future. It is possible that, for some people, it is more in line with their views to celebrate family celebrations in a simple and inexpensive way. In my opinion, the best way is to combine both views and give the family the opportunity to celebrate important occasions with great contentment.
1199;Write about the following topic:Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Is competition instructive or toxic for children? There is a debate around this topic. There are those who believe that a sense of competition should be supported. On the other standpoint, there are those who believe that rather that compete children have to learn how to co-operate. I believe that supporters of competicions are partly right but also that co-operation between children is essential. The two strategy can be taken together to give to childrens all the tools they need to became useful adults.On the one hand, there are people who believe that to compete is essential for the growth of children. They believe that competitions rise the ambitions of children. They develop certain attitudes thanks to which they will have always bigger dreams and desire. The idea, therefore, is that children who have grown making competiions will became important managers because of their instinctive desire to be winners and successful persons. It is true that competitions permit childrens to develop their ambitions and to do the best they can in order to win. However, I strongly believe that a good understanding of the aim of competitions should be taught before they start to compete. Indeed, children have to understand the instructive role of competition and how manage the possible distructive consequences that could derive if a child is not ready to lose. Children should start a competition being aware of the possibility of lose and the possibility to win. I believe that is important to stimulate children in doing competitions but teaching them the important role of defeats and the role of coperation. This lead me to analyse the second standpoint.There are, indeed, people who dislike competitions at all. They believe they are toxic for the growth of children. According to them, it is negative to teach children to be against between each other. Rather, children should learn how to work together and co-operate. Surely, co-operation is a vital skill in workplaces. The ability to work in team is one of the most searched by different businesses. To learn how to work together means for children to understand their role in a group and also to think about the ideas that should support the team itself. Co-operation then permits children to develop fundamental social skills. However, co-operation alone is not enough for children's instruction. I believe that co-operation is possible just if a child is also learning how to work and produce something alone. Children, in order to advances ideas and give a good support in a team, have to learn to be ambitious and this is possible thanks to competitions.In conclusion, I believe that an instruction in which single competitions as well as team-works are encouraged is the most useful and productive in order to grow up efficient adults.; Competition instils ambition, tenacity and the desire to succeed in children. Some people think that the more they compete, the more they achieve, the more they develop. The debate over whether children should be taught to compete or to co-operate is very important as it has many implications for their development and future roles in society. Cooperation advocates point out the importance of teamwork and social skills. In the academic and sporting world, for example, a competitive environment can spur students on to greater effort and achievement, something which can have important consequences for their future success. Then there is the problem of dealing with difficult colleagues, co-operating to share responsibility and being able to compromise with others. Schools that teach cooperation rather than competition point out that children who learn to co-operate often become more adaptable and better at resolving problems in the work place. Children who are taught to compete are less likely to have to work in a team, whereas those who are taught to co-operate are better able to deal with a range of different views and to work together to achieve a common goal. I believe that a combination of the two is necessary for the full development of children. Finally, a combination of the two helps children not only to meet challenges individually, but to thrive in the right kind of team, making them more flexible and valuable in the future. For example, a sports team can be very competitive, but also support each other and work together to achieve common goals, something which makes the experience much more rewarding.
397;Write about the following topic:Some people think that hosting an international sports event is good for the country, while some people think it is bad. Discuss both views and state your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;International sports events are one of the most trendy interactions at any hosting country. Depending on the hoster, the events could represent a virtue or a slip. This dependence is associated with the costs, logisitcs, marketing, etc. I tend to be of the opinion, that the virtues outweigh the disadvantages and that they shall be considered as opportunities to exploit.Some people think of the international sport events as being disadvantageous, because for example of being a pressure on the countries' infrastructure as well as the provided services and facilities. Another reason might emerge as some countries also might not be well-suited for such events. For instance, despite spending a big budget on the organisation of the event, the lack of qualified personnel or needed objects and materials shall cause a massive distruction of the hostees' experiences.The other perpective of the usages and utilization of such events could be clear through the massive amount of virtues, which these events normally brings to the hosting countries. For example, these events are regularly sponsored from international organisation, which provide the financial means not for only the logisitcs of the events, but additionally fees for the hosters. Furthermore, the financial benefits shall not stop by the provided fees through the owning organisation, but also the global or regional branding of such country will affect the tourism and the local service providers absolutely positive.Concluding, international sport events could be absolutely virtous, if the hosting countries were to implement their strategies successfully. Should such countries be willing to give the event the raw focus on the organisation and the user-experience, that would absolutely lead to massive benefits financially, marketing-wise and from intercultural perspective.; Proponents of hosting an international sports event claim that it can help a country develop economically. Critics of such an event say it has the opposite effect. The supporter will say that a country benefits from hosting such an event in many ways. Firstly, an international sports event like the Olympic Games or the World Cup usually increases the number of tourists who come to the city, and this brings in more money for hotels, restaurants, shops and so on. For example, Brazil greatly benefited from the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. Secondly, such an event can enhance national unity and patriotism. A sports competition can unite different nations and different groups of people and make them feel a sense of belonging and solidarity. Proponents say that such an event requires enormous expenditure on construction and security, which diverts money from health and education. For example, the high cost of the World Cup in Brazil in 2014 led to a large number of protests from people demanding that the government stop using social funds for the World Cup. In conclusion, it can be said that although hosting an international sports event can bring economic benefits and enhance national unity and solidarity, it is also necessary to take into account the high cost and the long-term utility. After the event, there is a great danger of unused and disused stadiums and other venues, which have become a burden to the city. In my opinion, careful planning and consideration of social consequences are necessary for such an event to be a success for the country.
1412;You can get up-to-date news from the radio, TV and the Internet. Which kind of media do you think is the best to get the news?;Nowadays, there are several channels to get news, such as the radio, TV, newspapers and the Internet. I think the Internet is the best among these. .Since its invention, the Internet has been booming as a prospective industry. Not only because it is a combination of text, audio and video, but also due to its . It has threatened the domination of spreading news of the traditional media, and, I would say, is about to take control.We can find everything we want on the Internet – the latest news, books, songs, movies, cartoons… . With the radio, we can merely hear. Compared to a newspaper, the radio and TV can provide the latest information. For instance the breaking news of the Americans’ attacking Iraq was immediately online, as well as that the Twin Towers of New York were destroyed on September 11, 2001. However, we just cannot .The Internet is a way of getting information, as long as your mobile phone is connected or you possess a laptop. When I am a vehicle, I usually have my cellphone connected to the Internet, then browse through what in the past few hours, or log in MSN to begin a conversation with my friends. Reading a newspaper is also a good way to kill time, but for me, a youngster, it is not so modern as “surfing online while commuting”.The traditional media will never disappear, though the Internet has taken a big advantage the competition. And definitely, there is still a long way for the Internet to go. , the Internet benefits me the most, and I highly appreciate it.; The most efficient way to get the news is the Internet, because it is the fastest and most accessible way to get news from all three media. Because people live in a fast-moving world, it is important to stay informed, and each form of media has its own advantages in providing the news. When a major event occurs, news on the Internet can be transmitted within minutes, and the Internet has become a virtual world. The radio and TV use a predetermined broadcast schedule, which means the news can be received late. But on the Internet, news sites, social media and news applications are able to provide almost instantaneous information. Unlike radio and television, where a single voice presents the news, the Internet enables the public to view the news from different perspectives, including different reports, opinions and analyses. The speed of this news has met the expectations of people who live in a society that needs quick information. The Internet also allows you to read the news in your own language. And with this information, people are able to think critically and make their own judgments. And then there is the personalization of news, and this increases the level of engagement, ensuring that people get news that suits them. There are different sources of news that people can choose to follow. For example, someone interested in the environment can subscribe to a particular blog or news aggregator. And in this way, the Internet can be an invaluable resource for people who want to stay informed in a fast-moving world. In conclusion, radio and television have their own advantages, but the Internet is the best source of news.
1377;should children grow up in the city or countryside (advantages/disadvantages)?;Some people think it is better for children to grown up in the city, while others think that life in the countryside is more suitable for them. What are the advantages and disadvantages of both places?Living in the rural area is the best option for children by a group of people, while others believe that cities offer more opportunities. In my opinion, if the city offers security and green areas, I agree it is a better place to raise the next generation some advantages both sides.Firstly, the countryside in touch with nature, taking care of animals and helping with the gardening. Because of that, they learn how to protect the environment and to live without any technological equipment. Besides that, they have more freedom to play outside the house without any security worries, whereas in the city they are kept at home smartphones and computers for this reason. On the other hand, schools usually have lower quality and it is hard to find extracurricular classes. Therefore, children difficulties trying to develop their abilities besides the school curriculum.However, schools at metropolitan areas tend to have better quality and offer all kinds of activities. Even if there is a sport or an art course that the institution does not offer, it is possible to look for it in another place around the city. As a result, all children’s talents and passions can be easier to develop. On the other hand, security, pollution and contact with nature are issues that we have to worry about. The better option would be a city with an excellent quality of life where children could play in parks and gardens.To sum up, growing up in the countryside can be very positive for someone’s childhood, but the city will usually offer better opportunities for their talents’ development.This is a well written essay. It talks about all parts of the task and the arguments and ideas are extended and supported by some examples. The information is sequenced in a logical way and most of the ideas are linked using appropriate connective words. The choice of vocabulary is suitable to express the meaning of the writer, though in some instances word choice can be improved further (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows suggested corrections). Most sentences are error-free and demonstrate various levels of complexity. Overall this essay seems good enough to deserve IELTS Band 8.; The question of whether children should grow up in the city or the countryside has always agitated parents, teachers and authorities. Each environment has its advantages and disadvantages, which affect the development of children, their well-being and socialization. A big city is an educational environment that has a lot to offer to a child, because it is diverse in its educational institutions, leisure activities and cultural opportunities. A child can learn a lot from museums, theatres and public libraries, which can all contribute to their creativity and make them think. However, a big city has its disadvantages: it is a very lively environment that causes children and parents to be prone to stress, the lack of nature is detrimental to health and the sanity of both children and parents. In contrast, the country side is a peaceful environment, where children can get closer to nature. In the country, there are many opportunities for outdoor activities, such as walks, gardening and fishing, which can make them a healthy lifestyle and feel a sense of responsibility towards the environment. The dangers associated with urban life, such as crime and pollution, also make children feel less safe. There are also disadvantages to rural life, especially the lack of educational and leisure opportunities, and the limited availability of jobs in rural areas, which affects the family's well-being. Rural communities also have close-knit relationships that give children a sense of belonging. Nevertheless, it is a matter of personal preference and the priorities of each family to decide whether they want to raise their children in the city or in the countryside. The social setting of the countryside is also less diverse and limits the opportunity to learn about different cultures and views. Accordingly, parents must carefully consider their own situation to provide a suitable environment for their children.
1379;should unpaid community work be mandatory in high school (agree/disagree)?;"Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programs (for example working for a charity, improving the neighborhood or teaching sports to younger children). To what extent do you agree or disagree?It is argued that voluntary services charity, cleaning the neighborhood, imparting knowledge to the underprivileged, should be made mandatory in the high school curriculum. I strongly agree as it not only helps in students becoming socially responsible adults but also in shaping their character.Firstly, community service inculcates a sense of responsibility towards the society, something that is needed to shape a good society. For instance, the introduction of Swatch Bharath scheme in my school, The Hyderabad Public School, ten years ago taught me not only to keep the surroundings of the school clean but also to never litter wherever I go. Hence, now I feel responsible to maintain cleanliness everywhere. Such services are needed to develop a better society in the future.Secondly, voluntary services cater to the overall character development of an individual. It a feeling of empathy in children which is needed to build a better character. For example, an alumnus of Montessori High School, who indulged in petty law-breaking activities during school confessed that it was the charity service that he did in high school; which in his mind; him in becoming a better person for his family and refrained him from committing socially irresponsible acts. Thus, such voluntary activities teach us to value what we have and in turn to our personality development.That being said, we cannot deny the fact that many students misuse the time allocated for these services by considering it as an excursion to enjoy with friends rather than a learning .In conclusion, although compulsory voluntary community service has its drawbacks, it is still useful in shaping a child as a socially responsible citizen and also in their overall personality development. Therefore, pupils should be encouraged to involve themselves in such activities.This is a well written essay. It addresses all parts of the task and the arguments and ideas are developed and supported. The information is presented in a logical order and the ideas are linked by appropriate connective words. The use of vocabulary conveys the exact meaning of the writer and there are only minor instances of a word being used somewhat unnaturally. Sentence formation demonstrates a high level of control and very few errors (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows suggested corrections). Overall this essay seems good enough for IELTS Band 8 level."; I strongly believe that community service in high school is useful and should be a compulsory part of the school program. Firstly, such mandatory service teaches students civic responsibility. Students will be exposed to social needs and ills of their communities, resulting in their developing a better understanding of the issues and a greater willingness to help others. Also, they will have the opportunity to meet their peers, and they will form stronger bonds with them and with their parents. This will help them to have a better understanding of the problems and help to find solutions. Secondly, this will help them to acquire life skills. During the course of working on various projects, they will develop teamwork, communication and problem-solving skills, which will be useful not only for their personal development but also for their future higher education and for the labor market. Thirdly, the community will be united by this service. Students, who usually represent a cross-section of society, will come together to work on projects to benefit the community and will learn to get along with one another. In addition, this community service will give them practical experience that can enhance their resumes and help them in their future careers. This will make them a more united and stronger group. By encouraging students to give back to their communities, we can help to produce a generation of successful, responsible and giving citizens. In my opinion, the advantages of such a program are far outweighed by the disadvantages.
1419;“Some people say that the education system is the only critical factor to development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?”;Education plays a vital role in the development of a country. Therefore, some people think that the education system is the only important factor to the development of a country and they may be right.Education is the foundation of developed society. It is rightly said, ‘education is a ladder success’. If all the people of any country are educated then they becomes broadminded, civilized and progressive. An educated society improves the standard of life as well., education also creates a good employment opportunity and therefore country does not have to suffer from big problems like unemployment. Educated peoples are more aware of such as pollution and many more. A country becomes technologically advanced because of educated people.Not only this, but also by giving importance to education, the nations can get rid of problems like , poverty, unemployment and population growth that delay the progress of a nation. The crime rate can also be kept under . The standard of living of the people will go up. If the nations to be progressive it is very important that the people are more educated and progressive. Any country can become more technologically advanced and developed because of education.However, there are other factors that also play an important role in the development of a country. Such as governments have to encouraged people to do soIn conclusion, I would like to say that a good education system will lead to a developed country.; In the first place, education does indeed underlie many aspects of development, such as economic growth, social harmony, and political stability. However, it is also undeniable that the education system is not the only critical factor to development of a country. To ascribe to education alone the credit for the development of a country ignores other equally important factors. An educated populace is better equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to create innovations, enhance productivity, and meet the needs of the economy. Nations that place great emphasis on education often have a high degree of prosperity, because an educated population is more likely to start businesses, engage in problem-solving, and help to develop other industries. But a reliable transportation system and an adequate energy supply are also essential to a functioning education system. Without these, even the best education system will not be able to bear fruit. Moreover, the culture and equality of a nation are also critical factors in determining access to education and its quality. A nation that suffers from a lack of political stability, for example, will not benefit from a great deal of education, because its own system may not be up to the task. But a nation that values the role of education in social development and strives to realize the full potential of its people will inevitably be better able to meet its national goals. In conclusion, while the education system is indeed important to a country’s development, it is not the only critical factor. A well-rounded national development plan requires that all the above elements be in place, and the nation as a whole must take responsibility for its own future. Hence, I would argue that it is a more complex phenomenon.
