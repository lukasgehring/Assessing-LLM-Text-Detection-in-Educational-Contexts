1095;A country becomes more interesting and develops more quickly when its population includes a mixture of nationalities.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is belived that countries are developing faster and become more inspiring when their populations consist of variety of people with different nationalities. In my opinion, it is very controversial question, but I believe that nations who are tolerant to others and friendly are able to succeed in constracting better world not only for themselves and their surroundings but also for future generations. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view about attractiveness and development of countries based on national diversity.On the one hand, people of different nationalities are hardly able to understand each other and can be impatient for people who have another nationalities, that can create difficulties in communication, making agreements, sovling of problems. For example, people with different backgrounds can strat arguing about better governmental constitutions and politics, religions, educational system, traditional and another types of medicine, and so on. It worths to mention that none of those people will be completely right, if they deside to show off their experience instead of accepting ideas of others and just giving advice. Moreover, some disputes can even lead to quarrels, but not to finding the better dessisions, that can influence on safety of people with different nationalities. So, for living peacefully and sharing some ideas of better developmental practice, people should first of all respect each other independantly of their nantionalities.On the other hand, people of various nationalities are able to create not only interesting and diverse community, but also share knowlege and experience in order to achieve the best results in countries' development. For achieving this, people should follow several basic rules, which are usually unwritten, but those mental and behavioral lows should be understood by everyone. Firstly, they should be tolerant to each other and accepting some differences. Secondly, they should be polite when they want to share their knowlege and experiences, not showing off. Thirdly, it would be wonderful if they are able to create international community where people can communicate and make friends. Last but not least, they should remember that their attitudes for each other influence on the world as a whole where they and their children live, so they should be responsible for their words and behavior.In conclusion, countries which managed to connect people of different nationalities and create a friendly surroundings, in my opinion, are able to develope faster and look like fascinating diverse community which consist of people of various backgrounds.;The idea that a nation's appeal and development are enhanced by a blend of cultures is a topic of considerable debate. I strongly believe that a diverse population significantly contributes to a country's progress and intrigue.On one hand, a multicultural society combines a variety of perspectives, ideas, and experiences, fostering innovation and advancement. A notable example is the United States, which has flourished due to its diversity. The arrival of immigrants from multiple backgrounds has fueled technological innovations, enriched its culture, and boosted its economy. This variety has positioned the US as a global center for business, education, and tourism, accelerating its overall development.Conversely, a mix of nationalities promotes creativity, tolerance, and mutual understanding among citizens. Countries like Canada and Australia, with a high proportion of foreign-born residents, exemplify strong community bonds and social cohesion. Their diverse populations have cultivated an openness to new ideas, which has been instrumental in their economic and social progress.However, it is crucial to recognize that diversity can also bring challenges, such as integration and language barriers. Yet, with appropriate management and policies, these hurdles can be addressed, allowing the advantages of diversity to flourish.In summary, I believe that countries with a blend of nationalities tend to be more vibrant and develop more rapidly. The interaction of ideas, cultures, and experiences within a multicultural society can propel innovation, creativity, and growth, ultimately enhancing the country’s prosperity.
1374;Advertising affects what people think is important and has a negative effect on their lives (agree/disagree);Today people are surrounded by advertising. This affects what people think is important and has a negative impact on people’s lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?With the advent of the Internet, advertisements, originally displayed only on TV, billboards, posters and so on, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and commonplace for the general public. In my view, this kind of impact could be both crucial and, on a certain level, detrimental.On the one hand, this phenomenon could denote that although we have already had a diverse range of , people are still capable of inventing innovative approaches catering for all kinds of requirements of advertising. It is a symbol that demonstrates the creativity rooted in human beings. Apart from that, it also represents that the speed of spreading information is conspicuously escalating. More purposeful is, therefore, the fact that, besides booming of the advertising, it constitutes a major reason why people could be so prosperous in this digital age.On the other hand, there are various unpleasant consequences as well. Firstly, with the omnipresent , it could potentially cause people to do impulsive shopping. Secondly, the , if regulated in a mismanaged , could make people constantly feel uncomfortable or annoyed. In this sense, instead of being an instrumental tool to promote amenities, advertisements could be considered a hindrance when people are frequently blocked by them. Furthermore, it would cost one precious time to have to sift the helpful ad from a host of others.In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, advertising is a beneficial phenomenon for all with a number of insignificant drawbacks. I believe that in the future we can improve the way advertising is done at present, and embrace the positive influence of advertising even further in the long run.This essay is another example of what Band 8 writing may look like. It’s weak point is that the author goes slightly off-topic while trying to discuss whether advertising affects what people view as important and instead talks about the reason advertising is spreading and about human creativity. However, the other part of task type (negative effects of advertising) is covered well, the ideas are well-developed and supported. There is a clear logical flow of information and a range of transitional words is used appropriately to sequence ideas. The way author uses synonyms to rephrase the task topic in the intro paragraph demonstrates their lexical skill, which is also evident in other parts of this essay. There are many complex sentences and very few errors. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.0.;I believe that advertising plays a significant role in shaping people's perceptions of what matters, often leading to negative consequences in their lives. It has woven itself into the fabric of our everyday experiences, swaying our thoughts, emotions, and actions. Through a multitude of platforms such as social media, television, and billboards, advertisements mold our understanding of what is desirable, essential, and valuable.A key way that advertising influences our lives is by setting unrealistic standards and encouraging materialism. Advertisements frequently depict idealized and unachievable lifestyles, leaving viewers feeling dissatisfied and inadequate. This can trigger a relentless quest for consumer goods, resulting in financial strain, debt, and diminished overall well-being. Additionally, the continuous onslaught of ads can foster anxiety and lower self-esteem, as people feel compelled to align themselves with societal expectations and norms.Furthermore, advertising has the power to skew people's values and priorities, diverting their attention from what genuinely holds significance in life. By prioritizing physical appearance, wealth, and social status, advertisements can redirect focus from more meaningful pursuits such as relationships, personal development, and contributions to the community. This can create a sense of disconnection and confusion as individuals become increasingly fixated on external approval and material possessions, rather than cultivating internal satisfaction and staying true to their core values.In summary, advertising profoundly influences our perceptions of importance and can detrimentally affect our lives. By fostering materialistic attitudes, setting unrealistic aspirations, and manipulating core values, advertisements can lead to increased anxiety, decreased well-being, and disorientation. It is crucial for individuals to cultivate a critical perspective on the impact of advertising and to nurture a more genuine and balanced understanding of what truly matters in life.
1395;Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone’s life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is a negative one. Discuss both views and include your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. You should write at least 250 words.;Many people wonder about . Some people think that it has negative impact in our life. However, positive effect on this world.? Of Course for several reasons: firstly, it motivates the psychological point in everyone, and women in particular. They will run to buy this advertised product especially if it’s from , just to show their beauty to men, which may lead to negative effects of too much sexual attention. Secondly, you can sit comfortably with your family and suddenly the telephone is ringing, but it’s nothing important, it’s just another company to convince you to buy one of their products. It is a real . Lastly, sometimes you do not have the financial ability to buy something, but with these new methods of advertisement, you run to buy it, which affect your budget.On the other hand, there are some good sides to advertising. For instance, it compares the prices of many companies which the consumer. Besides, it really see more products which we unless the TV or Radio advertised them. , it breaks our daily routine and allows us to see new faces and learn the language better with the help of the daily updates they deliver through .In conclusion, as we can see there are many aspects to this . I feel that we gain no benefits at all from advertisement, it plays buy more things that they do not need it at all.;Advertising plays a fundamental role in our everyday experiences, and its effects continue to spark discussion. On one hand, many argue that advertising has a beneficial impact on our lives. Proponents suggest that it keeps us informed about new products, services, and ideas, which can enhance our quality of life and expand our options. For instance, advertisements for essential medications and public health campaigns can raise awareness about diseases and preventative measures. Furthermore, advertising can promote cultural and social principles, such as equality and environmental stewardship, through compelling and thought-provoking content.Conversely, some people view advertising as a detrimental force. They argue that it manipulates consumers into purchasing unnecessary items, instills unrealistic expectations, and fosters a culture of materialism. Additionally, advertising can sometimes be misleading, leading individuals to make poor choices. For example, certain advertisements for food items and cosmetics often make exaggerated claims or showcase unrealistic imagery, potentially harming consumers. Advertising can also be intrusive and irritating, manifesting as spam emails, pop-up ads, or loud commercials that interrupt our daily lives and create annoyance.In my view, advertising has both positive and negative aspects, largely dependent on its execution. While it can deliver valuable information and champion important causes, it can also be deceptive and coercive. For advertising to be a constructive element in our lives, companies and advertisers need to embrace honesty, transparency, and social responsibility. They should aim to produce advertisements that are informative, engaging, and considerate of consumers' time and intellect. Through this approach, advertising can serve as a powerful tool for educating and empowering individuals, rather than a source of irritation. Ultimately, it is our responsibility as consumers to critically assess advertisements and make knowledgeable choices regarding the products and services we endorse.
845;Boxing is a blood sport which often results in physical injury. It is inappropriate for this sport to exist in the modern age.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;There is debatable issue as to whether boxing, a seemingly bloody sport, should be excluded from the modern society. As far as I am concerned, the attempt to remove boxing from the current age is utterly unjustified.Admittedly, boxing is often associated with various disturbing factors, such as foul language, disregard to rivals, violent punches and inelegant appearance as a result of intense physical contacts. However, such gory scenes may frequently take place in underground boxing games which are barely recognised by the professional community of boxing and by the legal system. Unlike underground boxing, professional boxing upholds moral principles and universal values, for examples, respect to opponents, obedience of rules, etc. Also, professional boxers are protected by safety equipment and judges who may stop the game when witnessing any player suffering serious injuries. Therefore, the health hazards involved in boxing games may not be as severe as the public assumes.Another reason reinforcing my position is that boxing already enjoys considerable popularity around the world and plays an important part in people's entertainment, as exemplified by the successful ticket sales of most boxing games and high audience rating of TV programmes broadcasting boxing matches. Given such popularity of boxing, the removal of this sport may cause widespread dissatisfaction and complaint.To draw a conclusion, the exclusion of boxing is completely groundless and irrational, given the safety protection, sportmanship and popularity as reflected in this sport. I expect in the future, more views could arise to furnish the understanding in this regard.;The presence of boxing as a sport in today's society has sparked considerable debate, with some claiming it is a blood sport that should not exist in the modern world. While it is undeniable that boxing can lead to physical injuries, I contend that there is a valid place for the sport.One of the main arguments in favor of boxing is that, like any contact sport, it involves risks that participants willingly accept. Boxers engage in extensive training and preparation to reduce the possibility of injury, and various safety measures, such as mandatory medical evaluations and the use of protective gear, are implemented to safeguard their health. Furthermore, many athletes and boxing organizations prioritize participant safety, promoting responsible and safe practices within the sport.Another point against the notion of banning boxing is the potential advantages it offers. The sport can serve as an influential means for social mobility and personal growth, particularly for youth from marginalized backgrounds. It instills discipline, perseverance, and resilience—qualities that are essential in life. Take, for instance, the case of renowned boxer Manny Pacquiao, who emerged from poverty to achieve world champion status, exemplifying the transformative impact of boxing.Additionally, it is important to recognize that boxing has progressed over time, with improved medical care and safety protocols significantly lowering the risks of severe injury. The sport also boasts a rich cultural and historical significance, with many viewing it as an art form that demands skill, strategy, and athletic prowess.In summary, despite the inherent risks associated with boxing, I believe it can thrive in contemporary society when proper safety measures, regulations, and a culture of responsibility are upheld. The benefits it provides, particularly in terms of personal development and social mobility, as well as its cultural relevance, outweigh the arguments for its elimination.
1429;Boys are most influenced by their fathers and girls are most influenced by their mothers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons to support your opinion.;It is true that nowadays have a great influence children. Some people hold the opinion that the same sex is the major determination of influencing parent, but others . As far as I am concerned, . My arguments for this point are listed below.First of all, a father is the person who have already passed ways his son is passing now, in other words, sons are following their father’s footsteps. , based on experience it is easy for a father to notice his sons’ drawbacks and to influence them.Secondly, it is true that a boy is , a girl is a subtle and fragile one. It is hard for mothers to influence their sons, because it is not likely that can affect a strong one.In conclusion, it seems to me unfair that boys are most influenced by their mothers. Based on at least two points above I strongly agree that children are influenced by a parent of the same gender.;The belief that boys are primarily shaped by their fathers and girls by their mothers is a prevalent stereotype. Nonetheless, I challenge this perspective. While it is evident that parents significantly influence their children's development, categorizing this influence strictly by gender is an oversimplification.In truth, both mothers and fathers can make substantial impacts on their children, irrespective of gender. Children often view both parents as role models, absorbing lessons from their values, experiences, and behaviors. For example, a boy might gain insights on emotional intelligence and empathy from his mother, while a girl might learn about resilience and self-reliance from her father. Additionally, in many families, childcare responsibilities are shared, which means both parents offer equal support and guidance, complicating the idea of a singular primary influence.Moreover, research indicates that a child's development is affected by a complex interplay of factors, including family dynamics, social environments, and individual temperaments. The parent-child relationship is unique to each family and can be influenced by elements such as parental engagement, communication styles, and conflict management. Thus, it is unrealistic to assume that boys are exclusively influenced by their fathers and girls by their mothers.In summary, although parents undoubtedly play a vital role in their children's development, this influence does not align neatly with gender. Both mothers and fathers can significantly affect their children, and the nature of that influence is intricate and varied. It is crucial to acknowledge and embrace the diversity of family relationships and the different ways in which parents contribute to their children's growth and development.
1364;Changing drivers age limits is the best way to reduce traffic accidents (from Target Band ;This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskThe best way to reduce traffic accidents is to raise the age limit for younger drivers and to lower the age limit for elderly ones. Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsIn today’s world the number of traffic accidents is constantly rising as well as the number of injuries and deaths they cause. A better regulative approach is required traffic accidents can be reduced. Some people say that changing the drivers’ age limits is the best solution to the problem. However, there are other, more practical ways to deal with this problem.One alternative is imposing heavier fines the drivers who exceed the permitted alcohol consumption. According to recent , a great proportion of traffic accidents has alcohol as its reason. Utilising technology and installing devices that detect drunk drivers and lock car ignition can be used to keep people with track record of drunk driving off the roads. On some occasions and for repeat offenders in particular, a prison sentence may also be considered.Furthermore, people should be better educated and more careful while behind the wheel. To be more specific, people should learn to obey road rules and respect the other drivers instead of causing tension or submitting to road rage. In addition, heavy fines should also be levied for exceeded speed limits. Last but not least, safer and wider roads should be constructed to make for easier and more comfortable driving.Tightening age limits for drivers can be a complementary approach. For example, the elderly with vision problems or other important health issues should be excluded from driving. Besides, young people under 18 years old are considered immature to drive. However, maturity does not necessarily always increases with one’s age, which is why other measures are needed dangerous driving.In conclusion, I believe that stronger measures should be implemented for the prevention of traffic accidents, and drivers should have a more responsible attitude. Setting age limits could be helpful but should not be considered the optimal and only solution to the problem.The writer’s position is clear throughout the essay. There is a logical organisation of information and effective use of paragraphing. The range of vocabulary is wide enough for the student to show flexibility and accuracy of expression. Overall, the control of grammar and punctuation is good, with only a few errors made. The essay is up to the mark and is likely to get Band 8 in IELTS.;The idea of changing age restrictions for drivers as a strategy to decrease traffic accidents has ignited significant controversy. While some believe that adjusting the age limits could effectively reduce road incidents, the situation is much more nuanced.On one side, raising the driving age might reduce accidents linked to inexperienced young drivers. Research shows that novice drivers, especially teenagers, are more susceptible to accidents due to their limited experience and propensity for risky behavior. By increasing the legal driving age, the frequency of accidents involving this group could indeed diminish.However, this approach is overly simplistic and fails to tackle the underlying causes of traffic incidents. Factors such as inadequate road conditions, vehicle upkeep, and reckless driving behaviors across all age demographics play substantial roles in accident rates. Additionally, changing the age limit could inadvertently lead to an increase in unlicensed driving among young people, thereby heightening the risk of accidents.A more thorough solution would require improvements in driver education, enhancement of road infrastructure, and enforcement of stricter traffic regulations. This comprehensive strategy would not only lower accident rates among young drivers but also address the wider issue of road safety. Implementing a graduated licensing system that gradually introduces driving privileges would also allow new drivers to accumulate experience in a controlled environment.In summary, while modifying the driving age limit may offer some advantages, it is not the most effective or practical solution for reducing traffic accidents. A holistic strategy that focuses on the root causes of accidents and fosters a culture of safe driving among all road users is essential. By adopting such an approach, we can work towards safer roads for everyone, irrespective of age.
1366;Childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents (agree/disagree);"Childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion and include relevant examples.It is true that parents need some knowledge and experience in order to raise their in an appropriate way. In this regard, many families attend different training courses. While I agree that these courses might be useful for some of them, I totally disagree with the recommended obligatory of such training.On the one hand, training courses usually offered by governments could be very useful for those guardians who have a with special needs. For example, if a child has a birth defect or has been diagnosed with any mental or musculoskeletal disorders, these kinds of training could be lifesaving. Additionally, as we know, the first few months after birth are really a crucial period of a child’s life; parents should obtain different information related to their child’s vaccinations, common health problems, different developmental issues and so on, which can be delivered through such training courses.On the other hand, I believe that making these programs a mandatory option would cause several problems for societies and individuals as well. To begin with, in order to achieve this goal, many professionals should be trained which may not be affordable for some governments. From an individual’s point of view, this kind of programs could be very time-consuming for some families who have other at home or who work long hours. The other important consideration is that parent training courses may not provide all the necessary information for each and every family. To be more specific, parents could get more beneficial information through different websites such as YouTube according to their own preferences.In conclusion, although I believe that many families can take advantage training courses, I do believe that making them a compulsory option for everyone is too time and money-consuming for individuals and governments.The introduction is very good and relevant. The writer’s position is balanced, relevantly and properly developed in two body paragraphs. The conclusion summarizes both sides of the argument and logically finished the essay. To maintain the necessary level of formality the word ‘kids’ should be replaced with ‘children’ everywhere in this essay. The use of prepositions needs more attention as some are inappropriate or incorrect. The length could be reduced – it’s not necessary to write a very long essay to get a higher score, and often it is better to write a shorter essay (no shorter than 250 words though!) but spend more time proofreading, correcting errors and improving the quality of writing. Overall this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.";I believe that making childcare training courses mandatory for all parents is not the right approach. While parenting is undoubtedly a crucial responsibility and equipping parents with relevant skills can be advantageous, there are compelling reasons to consider the potential drawbacks of compulsory courses.Firstly, enforcing childcare training could be seen as an unwarranted intrusion by the government into private family matters. Parenting is an incredibly personal journey, and strategies that work for one family may not be suitable for another. A universal approach could foster resentment and hinder participation.Secondly, not every parent would need or gain from these training programs. Many already possess the skills and knowledge necessary for effective childcare through their experiences or inherent capabilities. Furthermore, the quality and focus of these courses may vary widely, which could result in inconsistent outcomes.Additionally, requiring childcare training raises practical issues like accessibility and affordability, potentially adding stress to new parents who may already feel overwhelmed. It might also unintentionally marginalize those who struggle with childcare demands, leading to diminished self-esteem and confidence in their parenting skills.Instead of enforcing mandatory training, it would be more effective to ensure that such courses are available and accessible on a voluntary basis for those who would find them beneficial. This approach respects parents' independence while still offering support and resources to those seeking assistance. By fostering a culture of voluntary growth and support rather than imposing blanket requirements, we can create a community that values and uplifts all parents in their unique parenting experiences.
1384;Children should be engaged in paid work, agree or disagree?;"In many countries children are engaged in different kinds of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?The issue of whether or not children should be engaged in some paid work has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that having some employment experience is conducive to a child’s learning and development, I contend that it would bring harm to the child’s and learning.First of all, a workplace designed for adults normally child-friendly facilities. Desks and chairs are too high for a child; the light switches are installed on the walls unreachable children; also emergency training and facilities such as phones are only provided to adults. Furthermore, various hazards such as polluted air and chemical fumes are still produced in factories and farms. Undoubtedly young people would suffer in such workplaces.Also, children would find it frustrating when they are not properly inducted before starting a job. A child working in a cement factory would feel a setback when he could not get immediate support while struggling with the procedures of recording different raw materials that required by the job. Further, without sufficient support, a child’s misunderstanding or inappropriately communicating with adults would only disappoint him and prevents him from active learning and interacting with other people.To conclude, a child’s paid employment experience would lead to a negative impact on their health and active learning. However, recognizing the importance of children’s learning and their awareness of responsibility, it is advisable to encourage them to be involved in some volunteering opportunities where they can meaningfully learn and interact with other people with sufficient care and support in place for such jobs.This is a good essay. There are only a few errors (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections), but otherwise this work seems worthy of Band 7.5 or 8. Remember to always proofread your essay before submitting it. Keep up the good work!";"The idea of involving children in paid work is a contentious issue. While some believe it can offer valuable skills and foster financial independence, I firmly oppose this viewpoint. The involvement of children in paid employment can have significant negative impacts on their physical, emotional, and educational well-being.To begin with, children’s main responsibility should be their education. Paid work can serve as a distraction, hindering their academic performance and depriving them of essential knowledge. Additionally, the physical and mental stresses associated with paid jobs can pose serious risks to their health and overall development. Children are in a crucial phase of growth and require ample time for play, rest, and engaging in activities that support both their physical and emotional well-being.Moreover, there is a risk that paid work can expose children to exploitation and abuse. In the absence of strict regulations and protections, children may find themselves working in unsafe environments, enduring long hours for very little compensation. Such experiences can result in lasting physical and emotional harm, ultimately stunting their ability to reach their potential. Furthermore, early engagement in paid work can rob children of their childhood—a vital stage for developing identity, social skills, and emotional intelligence.Rather than allowing children to take on paid jobs, we should emphasize opportunities that encourage skill development, volunteerism, and extracurricular activities that enhance their physical, emotional, and educational growth. These alternatives can help them gain essential life skills, boost their confidence and self-esteem, and prepare them for adulthood without compromising their childhood experiences. In summary, involving children in paid work is neither appropriate nor advantageous; we must prioritize their education, health, and overall well-being over any potential financial benefits."
1383;Children these days are suffering from obesity, why and how can it be solved?;Modern children are suffering from the diseases that were once considered to be meant for adults only. Obesity is a major disease prevalent among children. What are its causes and what solutions can be offered?Nowadays, the increasing rate of overweight children and adults is a worldwide health issue. Obesity is a major problem which is increasing day by day in children. There are various reasons behind it. This essay will discuss the causes of obesity and offer some solutions.The first cause of obesity is junk food. It is often seen that mostly children are fond of burgers, pizzas, noodles and . These types of foods are easily available to them in school canteens. Children love to purchase chips, , ice-cream for lunch. Moreover, in this modern era, parents are working and they do not have time to cook at home. Parents often buy dinner for their children instead of preparing food at home. This calorie-rich diet is making children obese. This problem can be solved by teaching children to cook healthy foods for themselves and banning junk foods and fizzy drinks in schools. This diet can be replaced by milk, juice and fruits for lunch.The second cause of obesity is . It is true that the use of computers and television is increasing children. They spend most of their time watching television or playing video games on a computer. This technological advancement has reduced the level of physical activity in this specific age group. This issue can be resolved by encouraging children to do physical exercises. Parents can take their children to park to encourage playing with friends. Furthermore, schools can add sports in their curriculum to maintain physical fitness in their students.To sum up, it is clear that main causes of obesity are unhealthy eating and not enough physical activities. This ailment can be prevented and treated by healthy eating and physical exercises.This is a good essay. There are only a few minor errors that could have been easily prevented by proofreading this essay one last time before submission (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). Overall, this work seems worthy of IELTS Band 8. Keep up the good work!;The increasing rate of obesity in children has become a significant global issue. Recent research indicates that the incidence of obesity among children has surged, with about one in five youngsters classified as overweight or obese. This troubling development is linked to various contributing factors, including sedentary behaviors, poor dietary choices, and insufficient physical activity.A major factor contributing to childhood obesity is the rising intake of junk food and sugary beverages. Many children are attracted to convenient, high-calorie processed foods, which are not only abundant but also heavily marketed to them. Additionally, the widespread use of screens—such as televisions, computers, and smartphones—has resulted in reduced physical activity as children increasingly engage in sedentary pastimes.Addressing this issue requires a collaborative strategy. First and foremost, parents and guardians must take an active role in fostering healthy eating habits and promoting physical activity among their children. This can involve preparing nutritious meals, limiting screen time, and encouraging participation in outdoor play and sports. Schools also have a crucial part to play by integrating physical education and wellness courses into their programs, while providing nutritious meal options in their cafeterias.Furthermore, government officials and lawmakers must act by establishing policies that encourage healthier lifestyles, such as increasing support for physical education initiatives and regulating the marketing of unhealthy foods to children. Community programs, including the development of parks and recreational areas, can also enhance opportunities for physical activity. By collaborating on these efforts, we can work to decrease the rates of childhood obesity and pave the way for healthier, more active generations. Ultimately, it is our shared duty to tackle this urgent issue and equip children with the tools for a healthy and joyful life.
857;Competitiveness is a positive quality for people in most societies. How does competitiveness affect individuals? Is it a positive or negative trend?;Life is full of competition. Soon after the release from competitive university exams, the hard fighting for higher positions in a company will be waiting for you. While the competitiveness has been bringing us a convenient society, no small number of employments have been tired of never-ending competitions. No doubt about a positive effect on societies, but when we start to argue about the effect on individuals, it becomes more controversial. This essay will argue the drawbacks of competitiveness for individuals, especially from the perspective of Japanese modern society and typical Japanese office workers. I believe that cooperativeness and uniqueness are sometimes more important attitude than competitiveness.Firstly, competitiveness causes less diversity. If there is a competition, there must be the same evaluation metrics to differentiate winners and losers. The evaluation procedure needs to limit the metrics into specific aspects of the human being. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to prove that the metrics are proper for all of the possible cases and effective for the HR evaluation. For example, Japanese companies are likely to judge quantitatively based on the numbers related to performance. However, how can we evaluate the cooperativity or the non-quantitative performance like in creative jobs? Most Japanese companies adopted the HR evaluation methods based on average working hours per day and number of reports monthly. That’s why the Japanese tend to overwork to fulfill this requirement. In addition, as a result of placing more importance in quantity of reports, rather than quality, Japanese employees are prone to choose easy and short-term tasks or outsourcing instead of building by their own methods. This tendency causes fewer complicated and long-term tasks.Secondly, competitiveness causes less cooperativeness. Fewer people volunteer to play a disadvantageous role for smooth teamwork. Moreover, some people play an evil role by blaming or cheating the competitors in order to be superior to them. As a consequence, overall efficiency will decline and some people will be overestimated. Even if there are no problems temporarily, the long-lasting large companies will eventually become corrupt, and those who have the most political power, rather than real power, will remain at the top.Consequently, competitiveness is the basis of capitalism which brings us a brighter and more convenient society, however, biased evaluation and less cooperative working environment possibly drive people into nervous breakdowns. Karoshi, overwork death derived from too much stress and less sleeping, is one of the most serious social problems in Japan. We may need to rethink about the competitiveness.;"In many cultures, competitiveness is regarded as a highly valuable trait that motivates individuals to pursue excellence and extend their capabilities. The effects of competitiveness on individuals are complex, yielding both beneficial and detrimental outcomes. On one side, it cultivates a strong work ethic, inspires people to accomplish their goals, and boosts self-esteem. It drives innovation, encourages risk-taking, and builds resilience—critical skills for success in various life domains.Additionally, a competitive atmosphere can stimulate healthy rivalries, enabling individuals to learn from one another's strengths and weaknesses while developing strategies for self-improvement. This can facilitate personal growth, enhance performance, and foster a sense of achievement. Furthermore, competitiveness equips individuals to navigate the real-world challenges they will inevitably encounter in their careers, education, and other aspects of life.Conversely, an excessive focus on competitiveness can be harmful. It may lead to heightened stress, anxiety, and an unhealthy obsession with winning at the expense of learning and self-development. Those who become overly competitive might place greater importance on success than on their relationships, mental health, or overall well-being. An overly competitive environment can also create a ruthless atmosphere, where individuals are willing to compromise their values and ethics in pursuit of victory.In summary, while competitiveness can serve as a motivating force that encourages individuals to realize their potential, it's crucial to maintain a balance between competitive spirit and other values like collaboration, empathy, and self-awareness. When harnessed properly, competitiveness can be a transformative asset for personal development and achievement; however, when it becomes excessive, it can lead to negative consequences for both individuals and society as a whole."

Some individuals believe that they should be introduced into the classroom and used for teaching purposes while others are of the opinion that dependence on computers in teaching may pose a risk to students.Introducing computers and their programs in educational instuitions for learning purposes is a beneficial thing to students. The world is fast changing and students need to meet up and be at par with others in the world. The globe is becoming a more digital place and computers are the core of that, teaching using computers will open students' minds to new possibilitiies, faster approaches and more advanced ways of solving problems. A recent study showed that 75% of students who were taught using computers are currently more successful than others in their work places.It is understandable that people also think that dependence on computers in teaching may be detrimental to students. The students may become lazy and may not necessarily want to use their brains to calculate or understand things because the computer has already done that for them. Also using computers to learn in the school environment is also just adding to screen time for the learners; they are already being exposed to lots of wrong things at home adding school to it may not neceesarily the best option.Personally, students have a lot to learn using computers but truthfully speaking most of them already have the technological know how when it comes to using computers and if they actually want to learn more about how to use them, they can do so at home using the popular learning sites, it doesnt necessarily have to be introduced into the school learning system.In conclusion,computers are currently the foundation of the modern world and have their advantages and disadvantages, if they are put to the right use at the appropriate place and time, its benefits are beyond measure.";The incorporation of computers in classrooms has sparked considerable discussion in recent years. On one hand, the introduction of computers can significantly enrich students' learning experiences. These devices and their applications facilitate interactive and engaging lessons, making complex topics more accessible. For example, educational software can simulate virtual labs where students can perform experiments and investigations safely. Furthermore, computers allow access to an extensive array of information, enabling students to research and learn at their own pace.Conversely, reliance on technology in education poses certain risks. An excessive dependence on computers can hinder the development of fundamental skills like handwriting and mental math. Additionally, computers can serve as distractions, with students potentially diverting their attention to non-educational activities such as social media and gaming. Research has indicated that students utilizing computers in the classroom often spend more time on non-academic pursuits than on genuine learning. Moreover, excessive computer use can reduce the important face-to-face interactions between students and teachers, which are vital for nurturing social and communication skills.In my view, while computers should be integrated into the classroom, it is crucial to do so in a balanced and regulated way. They have the potential to enhance the educational experience but should not take the place of traditional teaching methods. Educators must ensure that students use computers strictly for educational purposes and continue to cultivate essential skills such as handwriting and arithmetic. For instance, a teacher could assign a project that requires computer-based research while also mandating a handwritten report to present their findings. By achieving a balance between technology and conventional teaching approaches, students can harness the benefits of computers while mitigating associated risks.
1329;Crime rates are likely to decline due to the advancements in technology, which will help prevent and solve crimes in an easier way. Do you agree or disagree?;"Nowadays technology is advancing faster than ever and many fields are benefitting from the opportunities this trend presents. Some think that crime prevention can be one possible application of new technologies, by allowing to deter offenders or solve crimes in a faster and easier way. In my opinion, innovation in crime prevention can be a game-changer that will reduce both the number of crimes committed and the time it takes to catch those responsible for them.Not everyone is optimistic about the prospects of the use of new technologies in crime prevention, and those who subscribe to the more pessimistic view say that advanced technologies can be accessed by criminals, therefore raising the crime rates. Such tools can, indeed, cause more damage if they fall in the wrong hands; however, it would require the offenders to be highly skilled to be able to use the modern technologies. Statistically, many of them tend to have a lower level of education, and for that reason they are likely to stick to the old ways of committing crimes, whereas the minority of highly skilled criminals are unlikely to make a big difference to the crime levels.Law enforcement workforce, on the other hand, has a much better grip on modern technology. Nowadays police officers and detectives undergo special training, take regular skill update courses, and use high-tech equipment. Facial recognition and thermal imaging are just two examples of the important tools that police are already using to find and catch offenders faster. Ordinary citizens can do their part in preventing burglaries by installing sophisticated systems with sensors, CCTV video feed and various alarms to detect and deter thieves. The combined effort will, no doubt, push the crime curve down.To sum up, even though the wonders of technology are available to everyone, it seems to me that they will better assist law enforcement in solving crimes, and law-abiding citizens in protecting themselves and their property, rather than felons. This will tip the balance in favour of reduction in crime rate and make the world a safer place.";The idea that crime rates will decrease due to technological advancements is a topic of considerable debate. I believe that these advancements will indeed contribute to a decline in crime. A key reason for this is the improved capacity to prevent and solve crimes more efficiently.Thanks to innovations like CCTV cameras, artificial intelligence, and data analytics, law enforcement is now better positioned to monitor and pursue criminal activities. For example, facial recognition software and license plate readers have streamlined the process of identifying and apprehending offenders. Additionally, the ability to sift through large datasets allows authorities to spot trends and forecast potential crime hotspots, enabling them to implement more targeted and effective policing strategies.Furthermore, technology has empowered citizens to take a proactive stance in crime prevention and reporting. Mobile apps and online platforms facilitate the reporting of suspicious behavior and the sharing of information with law enforcement. This heightened civic involvement, paired with law enforcement's enhanced capabilities, is likely to deter would-be criminals and lead to a decrease in overall crime rates.It is essential, however, to recognize that technology can have negative implications as well, such as supporting new forms of crime like cybercrime and online fraud. Despite this, I firmly believe that the advantages of technological progress in crime prevention and resolution significantly outweigh its drawbacks. As technology evolves, it is poised to play an increasingly vital role in reducing crime and fostering safer communities. Ultimately, the successful integration of technology by both law enforcement and the public will be key to maximizing its potential in the fight against crime.
1363;Dieting can change a person’s life for better or worse (from Target Band ;This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskDieting can change a person’s life for the better or ruin one’s health completely. What is your opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsSome argue that dieting has an extraordinary impact on one’s life, whereas others are of a view that it absolutely adversely affects a person’s health. It cannot be denied that dieting taken to extremes may cause more harm than good, however, in my opinion effective dieting is pivotal for maintaining good health and keeping a more attractive body shape.First of all, the possibility of increasing level of physical health lies with incorporating proper dieting in our lives. It is reasonable to suggest that dieting is effective for controlling our body weight within an ideal range in order to achieve the normal score of body mass index (BMI), which is essential for preventing us from overweight or obese. As a result, the risk of suffering an illness will be reduced. A recent research concluded that dieting is one of the most effective measures to cut down one’s body weight among the obese group, and it helps to improve their medical condition indirectly.Moreover, dieting is crucial for keeping ideal body features regardless of gender and age. A fit and presentable body outlook absolutely boosts up one’s level in his or her social life, not to mention professions that require keeping one’s body in an attractive physical shape. For example, dieting is adopted as a popular way for reducing weight among actors and actresses. A recent article reported that an actress who successfully regained her slim body after a period of dieting was offered an excellent job opportunity in the Hollywood film industry.In conclusion, in my opinion dieting has a positive influence on one’s life in terms of maintaining a profound level of health and keeping a more attractive body outlook.The writer’s opinion is very clear from the start and throughout the entire essay. Paragraphing is used effectively to organise ideas and information. The use of advanced vocabulary enables accuracy of expression and highlights flexibility. Overall, the control of grammar and punctuation is good, with only a few errors made. The essay is a good example of an IELTS Band 8 work.;"The timeless saying ""you are what you eat"" rings true, highlighting the significant influence that our food choices have on our overall health. Dieting can be a double-edged sword, offering the potential for life-changing benefits or unintended consequences. On one side, a carefully crafted diet can lead to remarkable improvements in a person's life. By embracing a balanced and nutritious eating plan, individuals may achieve meaningful weight loss, increased energy, and greater mental clarity. Additionally, a wholesome diet has been linked to a lower risk of chronic illnesses like diabetes and heart disease, contributing to both longevity and quality of life.Conversely, dieting can have negative repercussions if not approached wisely. Extreme calorie restriction or trendy diets can result in malnutrition, fatigue, and an obsessive focus on food. This unhealthy preoccupation can even lead to eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia. Furthermore, the relentless pressure to conform to unrealistic body standards may contribute to low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. Thus, it is crucial to adopt a balanced and sustainable approach to dieting, prioritizing gradual lifestyle changes over quick fixes and miracle diets.In summary, dieting has the potential to either enhance or harm an individual's life, largely depending on the methods employed. While a thoughtful diet can foster improved physical and mental well-being, a misguided or excessive approach can lead to serious and lasting effects. Therefore, it is vital to cultivate a healthy and sustainable relationship with food, rather than fixating on unattainable beauty ideals or rapid weight loss. By taking this approach, people can ensure that their dieting experience is both positive and transformative."
1417;Dieting can change a person’s life for the better or ruins one’s health completely. What is your opinion?;Almost of the women today want a beautiful figure. That is why we are able to find a diet programme almost everywhere in the country. Most of the women have and gone on a diet before either to or just health problem.A proper diet programme will help you not only to slim down but also to have a eating habits. For instance more vegetables and fruits meat, fried food and carbonated drinks. For a diet programme we shouldn’t food and water. There are some diet programmes from the doctors that help you to have a heart like the “Three day diet” which we can find on the Internet. This programme allows you to eat fruits and also some meat. This way of dieting will help you to avoid some of the health problems in the future like or a heart attack.However some people do not only go on a diet but they avoid eating and hungry for the whole day. All they have is just either water or juices. Also there people who buy special diet programmes over the counter which are not approved by the health department and they are doing so without consulting a doctor first. They do not follow the basic rules of dieting and this will lead them to some serious health problems like of some body parts or, even worse, death.In my opinion there is wrong with going on a diet as long as we follow the correct way of eating and .;"The timeless saying ""you are what you eat"" carries a significant truth, as dietary choices can greatly influence an individual's life. In my view, dieting can be a double-edged sword, possessing the potential to enhance one's life or completely undermine one's health. On one hand, a well-structured and balanced diet can provide numerous benefits, including weight loss, increased energy, and a lower risk of chronic illnesses like diabetes and heart disease. Additionally, a nutritious diet can enhance mental well-being, leading to greater self-confidence, self-esteem, and overall happiness.Conversely, extreme or unbalanced dieting can result in severe consequences. For instance, crash diets may lead to malnutrition, dehydration, and imbalances in electrolytes, resulting in significant health issues. Furthermore, overly restrictive eating habits can trigger eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, which can cause long-lasting physical and emotional harm. A diet lacking essential nutrients can also weaken the immune system, making individuals more vulnerable to illnesses.Ultimately, the cornerstone of effective dieting lies in moderation and balance. A sustainable and nutritious eating plan that includes a wide variety of whole foods—like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins—can profoundly transform a person's life.

By doing this, individuals can tap into the positive influence of a healthy diet, leading to a longer, healthier, and more fulfilling life. In summary, while dieting can be a powerful means of enhancing health, it is vital to approach it carefully, with balance and a clear understanding of the intricate connections between food, body, and mind."
1409;Dieting can change a person’s life for the better or ruins one’s health completely. What’s your opinion?;Dieting seems to be of our life in this modern society, especially for those who are health conscious. Different people choose different type of dieting methods, trying to achieve what they believe to be good for either their health or physical appearance. In general, most of the people who diet are focusing on controlling their weight.In our urban society, most of the working class not have the opportunity to consume . Their daily meals consist of fast food which contains large amounts of fat and salt. The most significant of this unhealthy lifestyle is the weight gain especially among those middle age working professionals.Therefore, most of these young and energetic people have to control their diet in order to stay in shape either for their appearance or health. The most common and proper method of maintaining one’s weight is eating less oily food, preferably more green vegetables, fruits and alcohol.However, some have resorted to losing weight by taking their diet to the extreme, not eating at all for days. Others will make themselves vomit after each meal. Many others will go for dieting medication and beverages that help them to lose their appetite. These unhealthy will cause internal damage in the long run.In my opinion, dieting for better health is more important than solely for looking attractive. Individuals who wish to control their weight should seek professional if they are unable to reduce their weight after switching over to a healthy diet for a period of time. Losing weight and losing your health at the same time does not benefit any individual.This essay needs some work. The first body paragraph explains the reason people have for dieting, whereas it should explain what are the advantages or the dangers of it. The second body paragraph explains how to diet, whereas it should present arguments for or against dieting. Therefore, the task is only partially covered here.;The idea of dieting has firmly established itself as a prevalent part of contemporary life, with countless individuals embracing various dietary plans in hopes of achieving a healthier and more attractive physique.

Furthermore, the relentless drive to meet societal beauty ideals and the obsession with thinness can adversely affect mental health, causing anxiety, depression, and diminished self-worth.In the end, the secret to effective dieting lies in embracing a balanced and sustainable approach to nutrition. Instead of chasing quick fixes or the latest trends, individuals should aim to cultivate a long-term and nurturing relationship with food that emphasizes nourishment, enjoyment, and self-care. This way, they can reap the many advantages of dieting while minimizing its dangers, leading to a healthier, happier, and more satisfying life.
1323;Discipline is a growing problem in modern schools. Some people think that parents should discipline their own children, while others think it should be the responsibility of the government. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;While some people argue that parents should take sole responsibility for disciplining their children, others take the view that the government should be in charge of such matters. In my opinion, the young generation should be primarily guided by their parents where rules of behavior and moral principles are concerned. However, in some instances government intervention is necessary.On one side of the argument, there are people who hold the opinion that the responsibility of disciplining a child falls squarely on parents’ shoulders, since they are their first educators, and it is their duty to equip their children with good manners and morals even before their first day at school. In addition, every family has a unique understanding of what a suitable form of discipline entails. Therefore, some parents are concerned that any form of punishment meted out at school might be too harsh. To overcome this issue, they believe that parents should be informed by the school of their child’s wrongdoing so that they could decide an appropriate consequence for their behavior at home.Unfortunately, not all parents are objective enough to make the right decisions when it comes to the upbringing of their children. Some may lack information or sound moral background to discipline their children in a meaningful way. Therefore, the state should shoulder some of the responsibility by implementing a strict set of guidelines and policies on how to discipline children at school. I believe that such policies result in children who flourish and are more likely to become productive citizens that actively contribute to a prosperous nation. Also, this would help both parents and teachers understand which punishments are suitable for minor infractions like missing an assignment or major incidents like bullying or skipping school.In conclusion, while both views are commonly held in society, I believe that the government must be actively involved in the policies related to discipline at schools as this would ensure the well-being and successful development of the youth.;The topic of discipline in contemporary schools has ignited a vigorous debate regarding who should be responsible for enforcing it among children. Some advocate for parental responsibility, while others contend that the government should assume this role. In this essay, I will explore both viewpoints and share my thoughts.Supporters of parental discipline argue that parents are in the best position to manage their children's behavior since they know them intimately and can offer appropriate guidance. They believe that as the primary caregivers, parents should be accountable for their children's actions. By taking charge of discipline, parents can instill important values and morals that are vital for their children's growth and development.Conversely, some argue that the government should be responsible for discipline within educational settings. This perspective holds that schools mirror broader societal norms, and thus, the government must ensure that children learn and behave in a safe and respectful atmosphere. Additionally, the government possesses the resources and infrastructure to assist children facing behavioral challenges.In my view, discipline is a shared responsibility between parents and the government. While parents are instrumental in guiding their children's behavior, the government has an obligation to create a safe and supportive educational environment. A collaborative approach between parents and government can better equip children with the guidance and discipline necessary for their success. Ultimately, a unified strategy is crucial for the well-being and development of children in today’s schools.
1066;Eating sweet foods produces acid in the mouth, which can cause tooth decay. (High acid levels are measured by low pH values)Describe the information below and discuss the implications for dental health.;The given graph shows the level of acidity in the mouth from consuming food that contains fruit or cane sugar and honey.To start with, if we take a look at honey-consistent food, we will notice that the acid level increases within the first 5 minutes. After that, the level of acidity remains at the rate of less than 5 pH, and, then goes down to a normal level. So, it is unlikely tooth decay to occur within such a short period of time.Regarding fruit and cane sugar-consistent food, it is quite noticeable that the acidity level increases dramatically at a level of less than 5.5 pH and 4.5 pH, respectively. However, the main difference between fruit and cane sugar is that the acid level of fruit sugar decreases within a bit more than 15 minutes. In contrast to it, the acid level of cane sugar goes down to a normal level within more than 25 minutes, which is more likely to get tooth decay.;The intake of sugary foods has been associated with increased acid production in the mouth, which can negatively impact dental health. When sweets are consumed, the bacteria in the oral cavity break them down into acids, leading to a drop in pH levels. This rise in acidity can contribute to tooth decay, a condition marked by the loss of tooth enamel and the development of cavities.Research shows that pH levels can plummet to as low as 3.5 after consuming sugary foods. This acidic state may linger for significant periods, influenced by the type and quantity of sugary items eaten, as well as the individual's oral hygiene practices. Extended exposure to an acidic environment can weaken the tooth’s defense mechanisms, enabling acids to infiltrate deeper into the tooth structure, ultimately causing irreparable harm.The consequences for dental health are considerable, as frequent and prolonged exposure to acid can facilitate tooth decay and other oral health problems. Additionally, regularly consuming sweets may exacerbate existing issues, such as tooth sensitivity and gum disease. To reduce these risks, it is crucial to maintain good oral hygiene through regular brushing and flossing, as well as to limit the intake of sugary foods and beverages. Routine dental check-ups and cleanings can also help identify and address any potential problems before they escalate. By understanding the connection between sugar consumption and acid production, individuals can take proactive measures to safeguard their dental health and prevent tooth decay and related issues.
1362;Education in financial management should be a mandatory component of the school program, agree/disagree (from Target Band ;This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskEducation in financial management should be a mandatory component of the school program. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsMore and more young adults in our country are heavily indebted. Thus, it is considered by some that it should be mandatory to educate school children the administration of money. In my opinion, people should not leave school without a sound knowledge of financial management.To begin with, a country’s development is strongly upon the purchasing capacity of its inhabitants. That is to say, people who are in debt or financially vulnerable, would not be able to spend freely or invest, for example, in a new house, thus hindering the economic growth of the country. As a consequence, the rate of inflation would rise and people would be able to afford even less, which could ultimately result in the collapse of the entire economy. A good example of this vicious circle can be seen in countries such as Argentina, where people have to buy household items in the black market, because they cannot afford to buy them in regular stores due to skyrocketing prices. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to teach children early money management.Another point to consider is the low standard of living that people have when they mismanage their finances. Individuals who are constantly short of money could eventually end up being socially isolated and unhappy, because they couldn’t afford to participate in leisure activities, such as going to the cinema with a friend, resulting in their from social life. However, this could be avoided with ease by offering courses in money management.In conclusion, I strongly believe that school children should be taught how to manage their finances to prevent social isolation later in their life as well as to maintain the economic force of their country.The writer’s position is clear throughout the essay. Paragraphing is used effectively to organise ideas and information, however the paragraphs could have been balanced better in terms of the amount of content. The advanced vocabulary the writer uses creates a good impression of mature and fluent writer. Overall, the control of grammar and punctuation is fine, and the number of errors is small. The essay could achieve Band 8 in IELTS.;I wholeheartedly believe that financial management education should be an essential part of the school curriculum. In our complex and constantly evolving financial environment, it is crucial for individuals to have a clear understanding of personal finance and effective money management skills. By integrating financial management into schools, we can provide students with the knowledge and resources they need to make informed choices regarding their financial well-being.Many young people graduate without even a basic grasp of financial management, which can result in poor financial choices and a cycle of debt. By incorporating financial education in schools, students can acquire essential skills such as budgeting, saving, and investing, which will serve them well throughout their lives. Additionally, a solid foundation in financial literacy will help them navigate decisions related to student loans, credit cards, and other financial products, enabling them to avoid common traps that lead to financial hardship.Moreover, teaching financial management in educational institutions can positively influence society as a whole. By fostering an understanding of saving, spending, and investing, we can cultivate a culture of financial responsibility and stability. This cultural shift can contribute to reduced debt levels, better credit ratings, and a more secure financial future for both individuals and the broader economy.In summary, I strongly advocate for financial management education as a mandatory element of the school program. By equipping students with a robust understanding of financial literacy, we can empower them to make wise decisions about their finances and lay the groundwork for lasting financial success. This, in turn, can enhance the well-being of individuals, strengthen communities, and contribute to a more stable and prosperous economy for everyone.
1421;Even though Globalization affects the world’s economics in a very positive way, its negative sides should not be forgotten. Discuss.;Everything has sides in the world, and so has the of globalization . The effects of globalization on the world economy are .We must acknowledge that the negative effects are from a different kind than the positive ones. the negative sides, like low in less developed countries are important to .If we take the Eurozone for example, the economic changes the process are huge. Many companies have transferred their factories into cheaper production to in the world . The results are rising unemployment rates in the “old industrial countries”.In regard to the other countries on the world market, such as China, this job transfer is a big opportunity. But no one can that the consequences for the less developed countries where economy flourished, based on availability of cheap employees are highly important: globalization based on this facts brings problems.Nevertheless, there are also . In general it is remarkable that there is a new tendency in “Thinking Global”. For instance, people are willing to more languages and get educated about cultures. Countries as undeveloped, such as India, are getting chances to be the in a certain field.All in all it can be said that the effects of globalization are enormous. The of economic processes has changed completely. It is important to think in bigger terms, not just about the country. The positive things that this globalization process have brought us for the negative sides. The should be a world in balance, but this has yet to come.;The rise of globalization has transformed the global economy, facilitating unparalleled growth and interconnectedness among nations. While the benefits are clear, we must also consider the adverse effects of globalization. On the positive side, it has opened new markets, created job opportunities, and enabled the flow of goods, services, and ideas, resulting in economic expansion, better living standards, and reduced poverty in many areas.Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the negative aspects of globalization. A major concern is the growing income disparity between the wealthy and the poor. In their quest for low-cost labor and resources, multinational corporations often exploit workers in developing countries, reinforcing inequality and social injustice. Additionally, small local businesses frequently struggle to compete with these large corporations, leading to the decline of local industries and cultural homogenization, where distinctive customs and traditions are overshadowed by dominant global brands.Moreover, globalization has drawn criticism for its environmental impact. The increased movement of goods and services has significantly raised greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. As the focus on economic growth intensifies, the exploitation of natural resources jeopardizes biodiversity and ecological balance. It is crucial to recognize and address these negative ramifications to ensure the equitable and sustainable distribution of globalization's benefits. By doing so, we can strive for a more balanced globalization that supports economic growth, social justice, and environmental sustainability. Ultimately, acknowledging both the positive and negative dimensions of globalization is vital for fostering a more just and prosperous world for everyone.
1319;Even though experts believe that walking is a great way to improve one’s health, very few people walk nowadays. Why aren’t people walking? What can be done to encourage them to walk more?;The benefits of walking are numerous, and experts recommend it as a good way to keep healthy and fit. Despite this, the number of people who walk on a daily basis is on the decline. The reasons for this are manifold, but there are also several solutions that may help people walk more.Lack of time is the most common reason people cite for not engaging in any form of physical activity. These days most people have hectic schedules that involve juggling their work and home responsibilities. As a result, they are often too exhausted or pressed for time and therefore opt for faster and more comfortable forms of transport, such as cars, bikes or public transport. Another major reason for the reduced number of pedestrians on the roads is a lack of safety. Most full-time workers are not free to walk during the day, and will skip it in the evenings or early morning hours, if they do not feel safe enough to do so.Fortunately, there are quite a few solutions to this issue. One is making walkers safe, which means the government should ensure that there are enough sidewalks and streetlights available in every suburb, so that pedestrians can walk or jog safely whenever time allows. Another useful option is to create special walking tracks and parks in neighbourhoods where people can get some much-needed exercise in the evenings. The added benefit of promoting the healthy lifestyle and walking in the community makes this solution even more attractive.To conclude, the pressures of daily life and lack of safely while walking reduce the popularity of this healthy practice. Governments can reverse this trend by creating more green spaces for people to walk in and addressing their safety concerns.;"Despite the many health benefits of walking, it's concerning that so few individuals include it in their everyday activities. A major contributor to this trend is our growing dependence on technology and various modes of transportation. With the convenience of cars, buses, and trains, many have become accustomed to these quick options and overlook the most basic yet effective way to maintain health—walking. Additionally, the typical sedentary nature of modern jobs, which often require long hours of sitting, further diminishes walking habits.Another key issue is the insufficient infrastructure supporting pedestrians. In numerous cities, sidewalks and walking paths are either lacking or not well-maintained, making it both challenging and unsafe for people to walk. On top of that, the enticing nature of screen-based entertainment and social media has fostered a more sedentary lifestyle, leading many to choose indoor activities over physical ones like walking.To promote walking more widely, governments and local authorities have a vital role to play. They can enhance pedestrian-friendly infrastructure by ensuring sidewalks, crosswalks, and bike lanes are well-maintained, thereby creating a safer and more enjoyable environment for walkers. Additionally, initiatives such as ""walk to work"" or ""walk to school"" days could help raise awareness about the advantages of walking and foster a culture of physical activity. On an individual level, people can strive to weave walking into their daily routines—whether by taking short walks during lunch breaks or opting to walk to nearby stores instead of driving. By implementing these simple changes, we can significantly boost our health and well-being while setting a positive example for others. Ultimately, recognizing the importance of walking and collectively promoting a walking culture is essential."
1410;Even though globalization affects the world’s economy in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. Discuss.;Everything has two sides and the globalization is not exception. Our first thoughts about this topic include the process of global “McDonaldisation” and, generally speaking, spreading across the whole Globe.Firstly, I would try to concentrate on the positive aspects of globalisation. As far as economy is concerned, like the Global Bank or IMF are always focused on developing the ‘Third World’ and helping poor people to combat their life obstacles (through loans and donations). Moreover, the world becomes an area of sharing thoughts (e.g. philosophical or economical doctrines), which become popular due to lack of barriers.However, disadvantages of globalization are also widely known. Some people insist that because of this process, the spirit of countries and nations rapidly disappears. The integrity, established years ago is on the verge of collapsing. Furthermore, there’s a strong lobby of communists who , that the globalization indicates an uncontrolled reign of capitalists and slave work of lower labour-class. We should never forget about the detrimental impact of global investments on the environment – the green house effect or soar rains are triggered by globalization.To sum up, globalization has both positive and negative influence on our everyday life. I can’t agree with the popular statement that we should try to avoid being affected by it. However, we must not forget about our surroundings and local communities. They have a great value which should last forever.;The rise of globalization has undeniably reshaped the global economy in many positive ways. It has promoted the seamless exchange of goods, services, and ideas across national borders, resulting in enhanced economic growth, job creation, and cultural interaction. Globalization has also allowed multinational companies to broaden their reach, generating fresh opportunities for investment and trade. Consequently, numerous nations have witnessed substantial economic expansion, lifting millions out of poverty and elevating living standards.Nevertheless, we must not ignore the adverse effects of globalization. One key concern is the increasing income disparity between the wealthy and the impoverished. As large corporations grow their influence, small businesses and local industries often find it difficult to compete, resulting in job losses and greater economic inequality. Additionally, the phenomenon has led to the exploitation of inexpensive labor in developing nations, where workers frequently endure poor conditions and meager wages.Moreover, globalization contributes to environmental harm and cultural homogenization. The rising demand for natural resources has led to issues like pollution, deforestation, and climate change. Furthermore, the predominance of Western culture and values poses a threat to the distinct identities of many societies, leading to the erosion of traditional practices and customs.In summary, while globalization has undoubtedly yielded significant economic advantages, its negative impacts cannot be overlooked. It is vital to recognize and address these challenges to ensure that the benefits of globalization are equitably and sustainably distributed. Collaborative efforts among governments, corporations, and individuals are necessary to alleviate the detrimental consequences of globalization and foster a more inclusive and environmentally friendly economic framework. By doing so, we can work towards a fairer world where the advantages of globalization are accessible to everyone.
1306;Every household should have a government-imposed limit on the amount of rubbish it can throw away. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"The amount of waste people produce can be quite shocking, with every person generating kilograms of rubbish in a single day, and all this can be difficult to manage. This has given some people the idea that there should be a limitation on the amount of rubbish produced per household; however, opinions are divided as to whether this would be the the most effective option.Having a limitation on the amount of waste produced sounds like a fine solution to a significant problem, with over two hundred and fifty million tons being generated in 2016 by the U.S. alone. Taxing households that break limits would push people to produce less waste and make them more mindful of what can be recycled or composted. However, forcing people to produce less waste might not be attainable.Households produce as much waste as they need to live their lifestyles. The waste people generate is only a result of the products they purchase, and will most likely wish to continue to purchase. Taxing people may be a cause of resentment, with many of them already struggling to pay their usual bills. In addition, if people produce more than they are allowed, this will encourage littering and dumping, so that they are not caught with more waste than entitled, and this in turn will damage the environment.Though controlling the amount of waste produced is important, there could be other ways of encouraging lesser output. In my opinion, governments should encourage composting and recycling, which will also reduce wasted material. People should also be more aware of what waste they produce and how it can be reduced. An education drive on these issues would perhaps be more likely to succeed in reducing rubbish than imposing limitations.";The idea of implementing government-mandated limits on the amount of waste each household can dispose of has ignited considerable discussion in recent years. Some argue that such regulations are crucial for addressing environmental issues, while others believe they infringe on personal liberties. Personally, I have a partial agreement with the concept of waste limits, as they could bring various advantages for both the environment and public health.On one hand, establishing limits on waste could greatly diminish the volume of refuse directed to landfills, which are significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. For example, countries like Japan and Sweden have successfully adopted waste management systems that prioritize recycling and composting, leading to a notable reduction in landfill waste. By instituting limits, households would be motivated to embrace more sustainable habits—such as reducing, reusing, and recycling—ultimately fostering a cleaner and healthier environment.On the other hand, enforcing strict waste limits might not be a feasible or effective solution for every household. Families with low incomes or large households might find it challenging to comply with such restrictions and could potentially turn to illegal dumping as a result. Additionally, the implementation and enforcement of such regulations would require substantial investment in waste management infrastructure and public education, which could prove costly and time-consuming.In summary, while I acknowledge the potential environmental advantages of imposing waste limits, I believe a more nuanced approach is required. Governments should prioritize educating the public about sustainable waste management methods and enhancing access to recycling facilities instead of enforcing rigorous limits. By fostering a culture of sustainability and providing adequate support, households can be encouraged to minimize their waste without feeling overly constrained. Ultimately, a balanced strategy that considers the diverse needs and capacities of various households is crucial for developing an effective and equitable waste management system.
1406;Every year an increasing number of students choose to go to another country for their higher education. Do you think the benefits of this development outweigh the problems associated with it?;The past twenty years have seen a dramatic change the number of students who go abroad . In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of this trend.On the one hand, both students and their country can benefit from this trend. First, students can choose more suitable methods for themselves because there are more options. The and teaching methods are quite different . According to foreign experts, Secondly, people can improve their foreign language, they can contact with when they are in a foreign country, and they quickly master the foreign language. Thirdly, it helps to promote the mutual understanding between their mother land and their destination countries. These students exchange information with the locals. Students can get better understanding of the countries. People in their home country will get more vivid information about other countries . Similarly, the locals also can get more clear recognition about other countries.On the other hand, there are disadvantages too. Firstly, it costs people a lot of money to begin college in foreign countries. Many families have to take out all their savings to support their children abroad. Secondly, some students cannot stand the big difference the new environment, they quit their study and come back home.To conclude, given the fact that in foreign countries helps students with their studies and promotes the mutual understanding countries, even if there are some drawbacks, I think the benefits outweigh the problems.;The number of students opting for higher education in foreign countries has been steadily increasing in recent years. This trend has sparked a discussion regarding whether the benefits of studying abroad outweigh the potential downsides. In my view, the advantages of this trend significantly exceed its drawbacks.There are numerous benefits to studying abroad. For one, it offers students a unique chance to immerse themselves in a different culture, learn a new language, and gain a fresh perspective on life. This experience not only broadens their horizons but also promotes independence and boosts career opportunities. Additionally, many international universities provide top-tier education, cutting-edge facilities, and esteemed faculty, making them attractive options for those seeking high-quality learning environments.Conversely, studying abroad can come with challenges such as homesickness, culture shock, and financial strains. Nonetheless, these obstacles can be addressed through careful planning, preparation, and support from family and friends. Many universities also offer scholarships, grants, and various forms of financial assistance to international students, which can help ease some of the financial burdens.In conclusion, while there are indeed some challenges related to studying abroad, I firmly believe that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. The experiences and knowledge acquired from studying in a foreign country can be incredibly valuable and can unlock numerous opportunities for students in their future careers. Therefore, I advocate for encouraging students to pursue higher education abroad, as it can lead to transformative experiences that significantly impact their personal and professional development.
1305;Everybody today should pay a small amount from their income in order to help people who are homeless and / or suffering great poverty. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Homelessness and poverty is a terrible but topical issue in both more economically advanced and less industrialised countries. To deal with this, many people feel that a small proportion of everyone’s income should be used to aid the homeless and poor. This could create more opportunities and change the lives of many disadvantaged people for the better.Though there are certain facilities such as shelters and soup kitchens to aid the poor and homeless, it is clear that this is not enough. In the U.S. alone, a very developed country in itself, nearly two million people are homeless. These facilities can lend a helpful hand; however, they do not help eradicate the problem. Those people who are homeless or poor can have trouble finding jobs, or, if they are lucky to gain employment, the pay may not be enough to support them and their families.If a small percentage of everyone’s income was used to help build more aid facilities and fund organisations to help the homeless and poor, the suffering of many people could be alleviated. However, this is not a perfect world, and taxes are high enough for many people. A similar argument could be that a portion of the taxes already paid to the government should then be set aside for this cause, but of course government funds are usually stretched to breaking point as it is, as governments have so many financial responsibilities already.Though the fundamental idea that people should pay a small percentage of their income to help the homeless and poor is admirable, it is unlikely that enough people would agree to it. People need all the money they earn after taxes anyway and, although governments already have too many calls on their available funds, in my view they should prioritise support payments for the homeless.";"The idea that everyone should contribute a small percentage of their income to assist individuals facing homelessness and extreme poverty has ignited a lively discussion. I largely support this concept. Instituting a mandatory, modest contribution from each person's income could significantly improve the lives of those in desperate situations.To begin with, a minor deduction from one’s salary is a minimal sacrifice compared to the substantial benefits it could bring to homeless individuals and those experiencing extreme poverty. For example, the funds raised could be used to create and maintain shelters, provide food and clothing, and offer rehabilitation programs. These efforts would not only deliver immediate assistance but also help individuals regain their dignity and become self-sufficient.Additionally, such a system would foster a sense of community and social responsibility among citizens. When everyone contributes, no matter how small the amount, it creates a collective commitment to tackling societal challenges. This shared responsibility could also inspire more volunteer work and community involvement, as people become more aware of and invested in the well-being of their neighbors. A case in point is Helsinki, Finland, which has successfully adopted a ""Housing First"" strategy that focuses on providing permanent housing to the homeless prior to addressing other issues. This approach has proven effective in reducing homelessness, illustrating the potential of thoughtfully designed and well-funded initiatives.Nonetheless, it is vital to ensure that the funds collected are managed properly and effectively. Transparency and accountability in how these contributions are distributed and used are crucial for maintaining public trust and maximizing the initiative’s impact. Furthermore, tackling the underlying causes of homelessness and poverty, such as the scarcity of affordable housing, unemployment, and mental health challenges, should be prioritized alongside delivering immediate assistance.In summary, while there are logistical and administrative hurdles to navigate, the advantages of a collective, small-scale financial contribution from the public to support those who are homeless or severely impoverished greatly outweigh the potential downsides. This initiative is not only a moral duty but also a practical approach to building a more equitable and compassionate society. By sharing the responsibility, we can ensure that no one is overlooked in our quest for prosperity and well-being."
1407;Financial education should be a mandatory component of the school program. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;In many countries the discussion about financial education getting more serious due to financial problems of young generation. Some people that financial education should be considered a mandatory subject at school.The common problem for those young people is that they don’t know how to spend money in right way. As we can see many advertisements often carry out the message, “Only 10 dollars a week, no deposits” which is misleading think that living in debt is normal. Financial education is one of the solutions for . The basic idea of financial education as a core school subject is to teach those young ones to understand the concept of using money and to estimate a risk of borrowing money to buy something in the future.However, another factor we need . In my opinion, the role of financial education is getting more important and it should be a part of the school program but the parents are also important and have responsibility to how to manage the money. More than 70% of young people’s money is from their parents. In addition, it has to be considered that a student might become person, talking about money all the time in class or even in a public place. It can be harmful for some students and affect their normal social life.In conclusion, I that financial education will have a positive effect on all young ones and other such social commutations should be considered just as important as financial education.;I wholeheartedly believe that financial education should be a required part of the school curriculum. In our increasingly complex financial world, it's vital for students to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to manage their finances effectively. Financial literacy is an essential life skill that greatly influences an individual's economic stability and security.Without adequate financial education, many young individuals are left to figure out personal finance on their own, often leading to serious challenges. They may find themselves in debt, making unwise investment choices, and struggling to reach their long-term financial objectives. By integrating financial education into the school system, students will acquire essential skills like budgeting, saving, and investing, along with strategies to avoid common financial traps.Additionally, financial education can enhance societal well-being. Financially literate individuals tend to make more informed choices regarding their finances, lowering the chances of a financial crisis and reliance on government assistance. Furthermore, such education can foster entrepreneurship, innovation, and economic growth, as students gain the confidence to make sound financial decisions and take calculated risks.While some might contend that financial education is not a conventional academic subject, I strongly argue that it is a crucial element of a comprehensive education. Making financial education mandatory would equip students with the tools they need for success in various aspects of life. In summary, I firmly support the inclusion of financial education in school programs, as it is vital for fostering financial literacy, economic security, and societal well-being. By teaching students how to manage their finances effectively, we empower them to make informed choices and achieve lasting financial success.
1404;Full time university students spend most of the time studying. They should be doing other activities too. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Full time study in university is a great experience in life but in parallel to that students other activities such as working for their pocket money, sports, participating in debates and . People differ in their opinion if students must in other things or stay concentrated on their studies only. The discussion will be presented below, followed by my opinion.Some people say that mere studying does not youth for a country. This way, students only earn theoretical knowledge not practical. For instance, students can be their studies but at the same time when they , they fail and cannot develop their confidence and work as brilliantly as they were in university. Hence, the best approach for them to be engaged here and there for practical experience.On the other hand, others believe that building a better career is the foremost thing in today’s world. So, they are targeted to their studies and gain as much knowledge as they can. Furthermore, if they are diverted from their studies, they will not be able to their .In my point of view, there must be blending of full time education and extra activities. It refreshes students’ minds and provides more energy . Moreover, by this way, they will learn how to with other people in the society.To summarize, it can be said that it is important to concentrate on but on the other hand there must be something to keep active and relaxed being involved in games, music, work and other extra activities.;The belief that full-time university students should predominantly focus on studying is widely held, but I only partially agree with this perspective. While academic endeavors are indeed central to university life, I contend that it is equally important for students to engage in a variety of activities that promote a healthy balance and support their overall development.On one hand, it is undeniable that studying plays a vital role in university life. Students should dedicate ample time to attending classes, participating in lectures, and completing assignments. Academic achievement remains a primary goal, and devoting significant time to study is essential for securing good grades and fulfilling the expectations of both professors and parents. Additionally, the university years are critical for acquiring knowledge, honing skills, and fostering intellectual growth, making academic effort a fundamental part of the experience.On the other hand, I strongly believe that involvement in other activities is crucial for students' physical, emotional, and social health. Engaging in extracurricular activities like sports, clubs, or volunteer work can equip students with important life skills, including teamwork, communication, and time management. Moreover, these activities create opportunities for social interaction, networking, and stress relief—key components of maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Pursuing hobbies and interests beyond academics can also stimulate creativity, innovation, and personal development, ultimately enriching the overall university experience.In summary, while studying is a core element of university life, I advocate for students to prioritize a range of activities that contribute to a comprehensive and rewarding experience. By finding a balance between academic responsibilities and diverse interests, students can enhance their university years, achieve academic excellence, and mature into capable, confident, and well-rounded individuals.
1293;Having a salaried job is better than being self-employed. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;If one wants to work for money, there are really only two options, working for someone else for a salary and being self-employed. Most people are involved with these two options and they both have advantages and disadvantages.Being self-employed means that the worker owns the business that is being done. This might be a small one-person business or a large company with hundreds of employees. The first advantage of this is the capacity to earn more money. If the business does very well, the income can be considerable and the owner of the company will receive the benefits. On the other hand, if business is not good, the owner’s income will be low. Self-employed people also have the benefit to some extent of choosing their working hours and holidays and they have the right to change anything within their business. With this autonomy, however, comes the pressure to succeed and the reliance on one’s employees, if there are any, to do their best to make the business thrive.Salaried workers do not experience the same stress as the self-employed owners of companies. They might have stress in their duties, but the pressure that comes with keeping one’s own business operating successfully in order to support oneself and one’s family is just not felt by an employee. The employee also has a certain knowledge of his or her income, as the salary is usually fixed every month. The self-employed owner’s income often depends on how successful the business is. The employee’s fixed income, however, does not give much scope for earning large amounts more. In addition, an employee does not have the freedoms of the owner or the autonomy, and for many people, having control over their lives is a significant factor to their well-being.It is certain that there are advantages and disadvantages for both being self-employed and salaried. I personally disagree that being salaried is better than being self-employed. I prefer the autonomy that being self-employed brings and, although there is more risk and pressure, this can lead to greater and more fulfilling rewards.;The idea that a salaried job is preferable to self-employment remains a hot topic. Some people assert that the security and stability of a salaried position make it the better choice, while others argue that the freedom and potential for limitless earnings linked to self-employment significantly surpass the advantages of traditional employment. Personally, I see merit in both perspectives, as each has its distinct benefits and drawbacks.On one side, a salaried job offers a sense of security and consistency often absent in self-employment. With a steady paycheck, benefits, and paid leave, salaried positions can be especially appealing for individuals who value predictability and stability. For instance, someone supporting a family might choose the assurance of a salaried job to reliably provide for their loved ones. Furthermore, these jobs frequently present avenues for career growth, training, and networking opportunities that are advantageous for long-term professional development.Conversely, self-employment provides a level of independence and flexibility that is hard to replicate in conventional jobs. Those who are self-employed can follow their passions, determine their own schedules, and have the potential for unlimited income. Many renowned entrepreneurs, including Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg, built successful businesses from the ground up. Additionally, self-employment can deliver a sense of personal fulfillment and satisfaction that may not be found in a salaried position.In summary, whether a salaried job is superior to self-employment depends on individual situations, priorities, and aspirations. While salaried roles bring security and consistency, self-employment offers freedom and the potential for greater earnings. Ultimately, the decision between these two paths should reflect personal values and what resonates most with one’s goals.
1339;High-rise vs. low-rise buildings, which solution is better for a growing population?;Some cities create new housing for their growing populations by constructing a smaller number of high-rise buildings. Other cities create more of low-rise buildings. Which solution is better, in your opinion?Sample EssayRising population in urban areas leaves governments with no choice but to build more houses to meet the demand. However, when it comes to construction, there is more than one way to build new homes. Some cities prefer to construct fewer residential towers, while others build a larger number of low-rises for their residents. In this essay both options will be discussed and a viable solution will be suggested.One advantage of tall buildings is that they can accommodate a large number of people while having a small footprint. This type of construction is popular in central city areas where land is scarce and expensive. For example, in New York City high-rise buildings have significantly reduced housing problems, by as much as 55% in the last few years. As a result of this strategy, rents tend to decrease which has a further positive impact on the economies of such cities. However, tall buildings offer little or no privacy, they force certain rules and regulations upon residents, and attract higher maintenance costs.Given a chance to voice their opinion, many individuals would prefer to live in low-rise buildings or even build their own houses. This option might be more attractive for big families and for older generation people who like to have their own personal space. Accessibility is also a concern for the elderly as taking the stairs when the lifts break down may not be an option for them. In addition, one or two-story houses are easier and cheaper to maintain compared to modern apartment towers. The downside of this type of dwellings is that they occupy much more land, and since land is cheaper on city fringes, new estates tend to be built away from city centres. This increases commute time to work for their residents and negatively affects their quality of life.In conclusion, high-rise and low-rise buildings have their unique advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, high rises are more suitable for younger residents and should be built in the areas where young population is prevalent, closer to the city centre and employment opportunities. Senior citizens should have a supply of lower dwellings available in quieter locations. Such flexible approach can be a good way to address the needs of growing city’s population.;As the global population continues to rise, the demand for effective and sustainable urban planning has become crucial. A significant topic of discussion in this regard is whether high-rise or low-rise buildings are more effective in addressing the needs of a growing population. Although each option has its pros and cons, I argue that high-rise buildings present the more advantageous solution.High-rise structures provide numerous benefits, such as enhanced density and decreased land usage. By constructing vertically, cities can house more residents without sacrificing green spaces or invading surrounding ecosystems. Furthermore, high-rise buildings can be designed for greater energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, incorporating features like green roofs, solar panels, and superior insulation. This not only minimizes the building's carbon footprint but also helps counteract the urban heat island effect.On the other hand, low-rise buildings typically require more land to accommodate an equivalent number of inhabitants, leading to urban sprawl and the destruction of natural habitats. Additionally, they are generally less energy-efficient due to their larger surface area exposed to the elements, which results in higher heating and cooling expenses.It’s also essential to examine the social and economic aspects of high-rise development. High-rise buildings can be constructed to include community amenities such as parks, schools, and healthcare facilities, which can encourage a sense of community and social cohesion. Moreover, they can offer a variety of housing options, ranging from affordable apartments to luxury units, thereby enhancing social mobility and economic diversity.In summary, while low-rise structures have their merits, I contend that high-rise buildings are the superior choice for accommodating a growing population. By building upwards, cities can effectively house more people, minimize environmental impact, and foster social and economic diversity.
1365;IELTS Essay, topic: Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between the rich and poor, while others disagree (discuss);Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between rich and poor people, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.There is no doubt that modern technology is reshaping our planet and affecting every aspect of human lives. From a social perspective, many people argue that the gap between the upper class and lower classes is widening as a result of technological advancements. Others, however, believe the opposite.There are several reasons why one could think that the wealth inequality is, indeed, increasing. The most common reason is automation. Driven by technology, automation reduces the need for manual labour. As a result, less work opportunities are available for unskilled people. With each iteration of the cycle the competition increases and wages decrease. , technology has increased the minimum level of needs that should be satisfied. Nowadays, everybody should have a mobile phone and an internet connection, including the poor. This increases the monetary burden on them as they must borrow to cover these new needs.However, I firmly believe that the aforementioned opinion is ludicrous. The most obvious reason is that modern technology has facilitated the road to riches in an unprecedented manner. For instance, many of the internet billionaires are from lower and middle classes. Moreover, the major leaps in agricultural technologies magnified food production. As a result, food has become more affordable and available. Finally, leveraging technology has dramatically increased workers’ productivity. Consequently, compensations and salaries have increased.In conclusion, I strongly believe that technology could possibly narrow the difference between social classes. Increased food production, opportunities and productivity are just few examples of technology’s contribution to bridging the wealth gap.This essay adequately covers all parts of the task. The ideas expressed in this written response are relevant, well-developed, ordered in a logical way and supported. The paragraphing is suitable and cohesion is maintained throughout the essay. A good range of vocabulary and the writer’s fluency are evident. There are no spelling errors and very few mistakes in word choice and grammar, most sentences are error-free. The essay is likely to get Band 8 in IELTS.;The emergence of modern technology has ignited a vigorous discussion regarding its effects on socioeconomic inequality. Some contend that technological advancements are deepening the divide between the wealthy and the less affluent, while others argue that these innovations hold the potential to help bridge this gap.Proponents of the view that technology is widening inequality highlight that access to advanced tools is predominantly available to affluent individuals and businesses. The steep costs associated with cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics mean that only large corporations and wealthy individuals can afford to invest in them. This situation allows the rich to utilize powerful resources that further enhance their wealth, leaving poorer individuals struggling to get by. Additionally, the automation of jobs through technology has resulted in considerable job loss, especially in sectors that rely heavily on low-skilled labor, thereby exacerbating poverty and inequality.Conversely, some argue that modern technology can indeed narrow the wealth gap. For example, the widespread use of smartphones and the internet has made it possible for individuals from various backgrounds to access previously unattainable information, education, and employment opportunities. Online platforms have opened new pathways for entrepreneurship and innovation, enabling those from underprivileged backgrounds to launch their own businesses and compete with larger firms. Moreover, digital payment systems and mobile banking have improved financial inclusion, allowing the economically disadvantaged to access financial services and manage their finances more effectively.In summary, while there are compelling arguments on both sides, it is evident that modern technology has the capacity to either widen or bridge the gap between rich and poor. Ultimately, the influence of technology on socioeconomic inequality will hinge on how it is leveraged and distributed. It is imperative that governments and corporations collaborate to ensure that the advantages of technology are equitably shared and to implement strategies that address its negative impacts.
1388;In many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?;Nowadays, many children involved in different types of jobs to have some kind of financial assurance for themselves. However, whether this is good for their development and personality is a controversial issue. I personally believe that paid works is harmful for children for several reasons.It is said that children gain valuable experience in the work place. This may be true. However, I would argue that children are mainly employed in jobs that require manual work and are poorly paid. The recent statistics reveal the common tasks that children are assigned to are washing dishes, mopping floors or serving food in restaurants. Meanwhile, this kind of jobs actually provide children with necessary and useful skills to apply in their future .This brings me to the second point. Defenders of child labour that it is an effective method of learning. The point is children should be able to apply knowledge taught to them in a real life working environment. Although this is undoubtedly true, it also means that children may neglect the classroom study and even fail the class. The worst thing is yet to come. They may become so preoccupied with the benefits ahead of them such as small salary that they may leave school.Finally, supporters say that it helps them to build responsibility in the family. They will understand how it is difficult to earn money and therefore have compassion for their parents. This is true to a certain extent, but may have a totally adverse effect on children. As children can make money at an early age, they would feel that it is appropriate to spend it on luxury things.In conclusion, I think that parents should take measures to restrict their child from work, otherwise it would have negative consequences to their future.;The topic of children participating in paid work is highly debated, with some people strongly against it and others considering it a beneficial learning opportunity. I believe the issue is complex. On one hand, it’s clear that many children are compelled to work due to economic circumstances, and in these situations, denying them the chance to earn a living seems unjust. Additionally, certain types of paid work, like internships and apprenticeships, can equip children with essential skills and experiences that may be advantageous later in life.Conversely, I contend that children should not be allowed to engage in jobs that are dangerous, exploitative, or that detract from their education. Children deserve to enjoy their childhood, and any involvement in paid work should not compromise their physical, emotional, or educational welfare. It is vital for governments and societies to protect children from exploitation and to prioritize their education and development.In summary, although I recognize the potential advantages of paid work for children, I believe it is imperative to find a balance between providing work experience and safeguarding them from exploitation and harm. The education, health, and well-being of children must always take precedence, and any form of paid work should be regulated and monitored to ensure these fundamental rights are upheld. Ultimately, it is our shared responsibility to help children flourish and achieve their full potential without having to sacrifice their childhood for paid employment.
1411;In many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it to be a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion on this?;In the Third World, children are usually sent to factories for laborious work. Many people believe that it is merely exploitation, while others think it is a good opportunity for them to life experience. In any case, children have their right to live and study in peaceful conditions. Therefore, using them as workforce is considered an unacceptable action.First of all, children are not workers. They have just learned about the vast world and do not have any experience or concept of working. Since these innocent children are naive and , they can be easily cheated and exploited. There are many examples of this in poor nations. Because using children is cheap and to control, many enterprises hire them and don’t pay them much. Although the government in these countries has tried its best, this kind of taking advantage of children cannot be eliminated.Moreover, children do not need such thing as ‘valuable work experience’ that is supposedly ‘important for learning and taking responsibility’. The brief responsibility of children is learning. They are not old enough to understand what working experiences are. Nevertheless, they can help parents do chores or housework. This will be a much better way for them to become more responsible for . In addition, childhood is one of the most remarkable memories and must not be taken away by forcing them to work.In conclusion, since all children are the great concern of parent and society, they should be allowed to enjoy life and rather than to work. Hence, one must ponder what view is actually appropriate for the sake of the children.;The involvement of children in paid work is a controversial topic that elicits varying opinions regarding its advantages. While some regard it as a form of exploitation, others perceive it as a meaningful learning opportunity. I believe the latter argument is more compelling, assuming the work is appropriate and does not disrupt their education.Participating in paid work can be a significant experience for children, equipping them with essential life skills like responsibility, time management, and financial literacy. It can also help instill a strong work ethic, which is vital for their future endeavors. Furthermore, many children from low-income backgrounds depend on such work to aid their families, and preventing them from working could worsen poverty and social inequality.That said, it is essential to ensure that the work environment is safe and appropriate and does not impede their educational pursuits. Children should not be engaged in dangerous or exploitative jobs, and their working hours should be strictly regulated to avoid exhaustion and academic disruption. It is imperative for governments and regulatory agencies to implement and enforce robust guidelines to safeguard children from exploitation and promote their well-being.In summary, paid work can indeed offer valuable experiences for children when conducted under strict regulations that do not compromise their education or overall welfare. By balancing work with schooling, children can develop vital life skills, cultivate a strong work ethic, and contribute to their family’s income, thereby equipping themselves for a responsible and successful adulthood. Consequently, I assert that paid work for children can be beneficial if it is appropriately regulated and prioritizes their education and well-being.
361;In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?;"Money can not buy happiness! Is one of the most famous sayings while talking about finances. It is argued that topics around money, wealth, and poverty are becoming dramatically more frequent between humans in different countries around the world. In my opinion, the extream part of it is a negative development; although, it has some positivities. I will address some of both sides in this essay.Talking about money during the major part of the day might make the person look stingy and this is an attitude that majority of the community would not like, thus, might effect on the person's social life. Moreover, having the same topic in mind all day might lead to an obsession, and as a result, this could lead to a depression because the person might not find the proper way to reach to the financial position that meets their satisfaction, which could lead to depression, or even worse such as going through illegal paths where it could destroy their lives entirely!Nevertheless, the person should be aware of his /her income and spendings and try to enhance their financial position to the best possible way. Also, the inflation that we are currently living and the noticable increase in prices could be a driver for people to talk about money more often.In conclusion, people should not be obssessed in money and to talk with everyone about it all the time. However, I believe that people should discuss this matter in order to benefit from each other, and to find more ways to enhance their quality of life.";The rising inclination for individuals to engage in discussions about money has emerged as a common trend in numerous countries. A key driver of this phenomenon is the increasing financial pressures and uncertainties people encounter in their everyday lives. With the escalating cost of living, concerns about making ends meet have become widespread, encouraging individuals to frequently converse about their incomes, expenses, and financial challenges.Another significant factor fueling this trend is the diminishing social taboos surrounding conversations about personal finance. Historically, discussing one’s salary or spending habits was viewed as impolite and intrusive. However, the growing culture of transparency and openness has made it more socially acceptable for people to share and compare their financial situations.While this shift may appear benign, it can have detrimental effects. An overemphasis on money can cultivate an unhealthy obsession with material wealth, resulting in competition and envy among individuals. Additionally, it may foster unrealistic expectations and encourage consumerism, as individuals feel compelled to match the spending behaviors of those around them.In summary, the growing tendency for people to discuss financial matters in their everyday conversations is a multifaceted issue with both positive and negative implications. On the one hand, it highlights the increasing desire for individuals to connect and share their financial experiences. On the other hand, it risks fostering an unhealthy preoccupation with material wealth and promoting consumerist values. Therefore, it is crucial to find a balance between openness and discretion when it comes to discussing personal finance, in order to avoid perpetuating a culture centered on materialism and competition.
671;In many countries women and men are working full time. It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;I strongly agree with this statement. If women and men are both working full time, they should share household works.First of all, if women and men are working full time, and they are working in the same amount of time, logically, the amount of time they do household works should be the sam e. However, if one of them work for longer hours, the household works should still be shared but the other one should do more household works.Second of all, everyone have responsibility to do household works because everyone lives in the house, makes the house dirty, creates dirty clothes and dishes. If there is only either women or men doing household works, it is not fair at all, because they both work full time.But as I mentioned before, the amount of time doing household works can be arranged, it doesn't have to be evenly shared. For instance, if the woman in this family work for longer hours or got an extra call by work, the man should help and do her part of household works. And when the man are working more, the woman should do the same. This does not only solve the problem of who should do household works but can also show that women and men are supporting each other in various situations.In conclusion, when women and men are both doing full time jobs, they should share household works. But it doesn't have to to be split in two halves, it can have alternatives depending on the working hours or special situations. In this way, the house can be more peaceful and have more harmony without arguments about who should do the household works.;The idea that household responsibilities should be shared equally by women and men has gained considerable momentum in recent years, particularly in environments where both partners are employed full-time. I wholeheartedly support this viewpoint, as it fosters equality and acknowledges the evolving nature of modern family structures.In today's world, where financial responsibilities are often shared equally between partners, it stands to reason that domestic duties should also be divided. This equitable distribution of labor not only lightens the load on women, who have historically managed the majority of household chores, but it also helps couples develop a more balanced and fair relationship, allowing both individuals time for leisure, personal growth, and career progression.Additionally, sharing household responsibilities can enhance family dynamics and strengthen relationships. When both partners equally participate in chores, it cultivates a spirit of teamwork, cooperation, and mutual respect. Children raised in such households are more likely to develop a healthy perspective on gender roles and responsibilities, challenging traditional stereotypes.Nonetheless, it’s essential to acknowledge that dividing household tasks may not always be simple or perfectly equal. Individual capabilities, preferences, or work schedules may influence each person's ability to contribute to chores. Therefore, open communication and flexibility are crucial in establishing an arrangement that works for both partners.In summary, as work and family structures continue to evolve, it is both logical and just for women and men to share home responsibilities. This collaboration not only reflects the changing societal roles of both genders but also nurtures a more balanced, respectful, and equitable partnership. Ultimately, a fair distribution of household tasks can lead to stronger, more harmonious families and contribute to a more progressive society.
1343;In many countries young people start living on their own after high school, is this a positive or negative development?;In many countries around the world young people decide to leave their parents’ home once they finish school. They start living on their own or sharing a house with friends. Is this a positive or a negative development? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples.Sample EssayNowadays it is becoming increasingly common for youngsters to start their independent life by moving out of their parents’ home after graduation from school. This trend has positive effects on the society and the reasons behind it will be discussed next in this essay.There are various benefits for both young people and their parents when individuals start living independently after finishing school. Young adults, in this way, have to take care of their daily needs, from house chores, cooking or cleaning to financial independence. Thus, instead of wasting time on childish activities, they are motivated to learn skills and work part-time or full-time in order to cover their living expenses. Although it might seem challenging for them to live on their own at first, it would give them valuable experience, helping them to become mature, responsible adults. Parents would also be pleased with this practice since they can enjoy their own lives by having more time for themselves. Not only would they have more financial flexibility due to independence of their children, but they also don’t have to change their habits in order to adapt to the new generation’s lifestyle. For instance, it allows many people to travel around the world, which would be impossible if their children were to stay with them after finishing high school.Admittedly, there might be some challenges involved in this way of life. In some cases and especially under the influence of new friends or housemates, youngsters might choose to get involved in dangerous activities that involve drugs or petty crimes. However, instead of keeping their children close through adulthood, parents should prepare in advance and raise their children to distinguish between right and wrong and teach them to take responsibility for their actions.In conclusion, although there might be some adverse consequences to this relatively new practice, I believe that the advantages of young people leaving family home outweigh its drawbacks, for both children and parents.;The trend of young individuals leaving their family homes after graduating from high school is prevalent across many countries. This shift has generated considerable discussion, with some viewing it as a constructive step toward independence, while others perceive it as a potentially harmful decision with negative ramifications.On the positive side, moving out after high school can provide young people with a crucial learning experience. It equips them with essential life skills, including time management, financial planning, and self-sufficiency. Living independently compels them to take charge of their own lives, requiring them to make decisions about daily habits, budgets, and future aspirations. This newfound autonomy can enhance their maturity and self-confidence, which are vital for achieving success in both their careers and personal lives.Conversely, there are noteworthy challenges to consider. For some, living alone at a young age can feel overwhelming, resulting in increased stress and anxiety. Financially, it can become a heavy burden, as young adults may struggle to juggle the expenses of living, education, and other costs on their own. Additionally, without their families' guidance and support, they might become more vulnerable to negative influences and risky behaviors.In summary, whether the phenomenon of young people living independently after high school is a positive or negative trend largely depends on individual circumstances and the support systems in place. While it can be an invaluable experience that fosters independence and accountability, it also presents significant challenges. A balanced approach that combines personal autonomy with continued support from family and community is likely the most advantageous for young people navigating their transition to independent adulthood.
1320;In many countries, a lot of food is wasted. Why do people waste food? How can we reduce the amount of food waste?;"Despite the fact that millions of people in the world go hungry every day, a surprisingly large amount of food gets wasted daily in certain parts of the world. In my opinion, the main reason for this is that people in the first-world countries tend to only buy food that is aesthetically pleasing, and fortunately, there are some ways to tackle this issue.It is shockingly sad to know that large amounts of perfectly edible food in the form of fresh produce get sent to landfills, and the main reason for this is that these foods do not meet the standards of perfection set for fruits and vegetables by consumers and grocery stores. For example, veggies and fruit that are misshapen or have a few spots on them are still good enough to eat, yet they are often left on shelves to rot in favour of something that looks less damaged. In addition, a lot of customers confuse the ‘best by’ and ‘use by’ dates, thinking that foods that have passed their ‘best by’ dates are no longer fit to eat. Another major reason for food wastage is that people often overestimate the amount of produce they require on a weekly or monthly basis, and most of it ends up getting thrown out instead of being used.There are many ways to reduce the amount of food being wasted, and I think one of the best ideas is to increase people’s awareness of just how much good food is disposed of, only because of our superficial biases as to how food should look. Raising the awareness of the staggering number of people that go hungry in third-world countries would make it harder to throw away an apple just because it is a little bruised. Also, teaching people how to better plan their monthly food requirements would help them not to overspend on food that they do not need; it would be great for the environment and their budget. The role of the government in this endeavour is indispensable as such task would be too great for any smaller organisation.To conclude, the wasting food is a serious issue that merits increased awareness from both people and the leaders of the world. It is unacceptable to discard any food when there are so many people who are starving, and hopefully our joint effort can help improve the current situation.";Food waste has become a pressing issue in many countries across the globe. It is estimated that a significant volume of food is discarded annually, resulting in not only economic inefficiency but also environmental damage. Several factors contribute to food waste. A major reason is overbuying, where individuals acquire more food than they can consume before it goes bad. Insufficient meal planning and improper food storage also lead to waste. Additionally, many people discard edible food simply because it does not meet their aesthetic preferences.To tackle food waste, various strategies can be implemented. First, individuals can plan their meals and create shopping lists to prevent overpurchasing. Proper food storage and utilizing leftovers effectively can further help reduce waste. Additionally, governments and businesses have a vital role in minimizing food waste. They can initiate public awareness campaigns to highlight the importance of reducing waste, as well as enact policies that promote the donation of excess food to those in need. Composting is another valuable method to decrease food waste, as it transforms discarded food into nutrient-rich soil for agricultural use.In summary, food waste presents a critical challenge that needs urgent action. By identifying the causes of food waste and adopting effective reduction strategies, we can lessen its economic and environmental consequences. It is essential for individuals, governments, and businesses to collaborate in addressing this issue and fostering a more sustainable food system. Small actions, like meal planning, proper food storage, and composting, can lead to significant positive changes in reducing food waste within our communities.
1331;In many countries, young people are finding it harder and harder to find permanent jobs. Why is this happening? What can be done to improve the situation?;In this fast-moving age, with the development of education and modern technologies, people strive to have a secure job after graduating from colleges and universities. Despite their efforts, so many young adults in different parts of the world have a negative experience of finding a long-term job.It so happens that most colleges and universities focus on students’ academic performance much more than their practical skills. Unfortunately, many companies reserve permanent job opportunities for experienced applicants because there is no need to invest much in their training. Lack of practical experience in new graduates puts them at a disadvantage as far as companies are concerned. The situation is made worse by the abundance of advanced technologies that can easily replace human labor. Robots and computers work more efficiently and with higher precision than humans. That shrinks the pool of available job placements even more, as companies only need to hire highly educated and experienced staff.Fortunately, there is a number of solutions that can help inexperienced workers gain permanent employment. An obvious one is that universities could offer internships to their students, or arrange workshops in addition to classwork. This would help students to get training and experience in their respective fields. Also, the government could examine the demands of changing labor market and steer young people towards professions that will be popular in the coming years. Together with colleges and universities the government could create special awareness programs for graduates, providing them with an overview of various job offers and their benefits. This way students would be able to choose the right jobs for themselves.To sum up, lack of demand in the labour market and insufficient experience are two major reasons why many young people have trouble finding a permanent position. Helping them gain hands-on experience as part of their studies and educating them about career options early on is key to improving the employment outcome for them.;The difficulty young people face in securing permanent employment has become a significant challenge in numerous countries. A primary contributing factor to this trend is the evolving global economy, which has led to an increase in temporary and contract roles. Many businesses are now choosing flexible employment arrangements that enable them to swiftly respond to changing market dynamics. Consequently, young individuals often have no choice but to take short-term or freelance positions, which do not offer the stability and security that permanent jobs provide.Another element exacerbating this issue is the growing prevalence of automation and technological innovations. Machines and artificial intelligence are increasingly taking over roles traditionally held by humans, particularly in industries like manufacturing and customer service. This shift has diminished the number of permanent job openings, especially for those young workers entering the labor market. Additionally, the expenses associated with hiring and training new staff can discourage companies from offering permanent contracts.To tackle this challenge, it is essential for governments, educational institutions, and businesses to collaborate in equipping young people with the skills and opportunities necessary for success. Implementing vocational training programs and apprenticeships can help prepare them for the demands of today's job market. Moreover, companies could provide more permanent job opportunities by investing in their workforce and fostering a stable work environment. Governments can also introduce policies that encourage businesses to hire young individuals on a permanent basis, such as tax incentives or subsidies. By addressing the underlying causes of this issue through collective efforts, we can foster a more supportive and stable job market for young people, empowering them to cultivate secure and prosperous careers.
1318;In many workplaces online communication has overtaken face to face meetings. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?;In today’s ever-increasingly digital world, online communication has become the norm for many workplaces. While this development offers numerous advantages for companies such as greater flexibility and efficiency, it also brings with it certain disadvantages like miscommunication, which must be weighed against its benefits.One of the primary advantages of online communication is that it makes it easier for teams to stay in touch without having to physically convene. This is especially beneficial when individuals or groups are dispersed across vast distances. Reduced travel costs, as well as time saved from not having to travel to and from meetings, also represent meaningful savings for businesses. Additionally, online communication platforms often have a range of features designed to make collaboration more efficient, such as providing an easy way to share documents and other materials with remote team members. To illustrate, digital resources can be sent quickly and securely via email or other software services like Dropbox or Google Drive.There is a potential drawback associated with relying too heavily on online communication at work, as the lack of physical proximity between members of a team can often lead to misunderstandings due to a loss of context or nonverbal cues that would otherwise be present during face-to-face meetings. However, in my opinion, issues of this nature can be solved by using written language more carefully to avoid any confusion or miscommunication among colleagues.In conclusion, when online communication tools are used properly, they undoubtedly provide companies with greater flexibility in how their teams collaborate without sacrificing clarity of communication, quality or efficiency.;The growth of online communication in professional settings has notably transformed the dynamics of traditional face-to-face meetings. While this shift offers several benefits, it also presents certain challenges. I believe that, overall, the advantages of online communication are greater than the disadvantages, though this is not without limitations.On one hand, online communication provides a range of benefits, such as greater flexibility, decreased travel time, and improved global connectivity. Thanks to video conferencing platforms, teams can collaborate seamlessly across different time zones and locations. This has paved the way for new international business opportunities and the rise of remote work. Additionally, the quick and efficient exchange of information online allows for faster decision-making and enhanced productivity.Conversely, an over-dependence on digital communication can diminish personal interactions, which are vital for establishing trust, resolving conflicts, and fostering creativity. In-person meetings allow for the exchange of non-verbal cues, such as body language and tone, which are often lost in digital formats. Moreover, online communication can result in distractions, technical difficulties, and misunderstandings that may impede effective collaboration.Despite these drawbacks, the advantages of online communication, especially regarding flexibility and global reach, far outweigh the negatives. As the demand for remote work and digital collaboration continues to grow, online communication has become an essential tool in contemporary workplaces. However, it’s important to find a balance between online and in-person communication to fully leverage the benefits while mitigating the downsides. By doing so, organizations can maximize the strengths of online communication while retaining the essential aspects of personal interaction. In summary, while online communication has its challenges, its merits make it an integral part of modern workplace dynamics.
713;In many workplaces, online communication is getting more common than meeting face to face. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?;According to COVID-19 event forced many company to change their way of working. One of the most significant transformation is the communication. The online communication becomes a must or inevitable for the company to be implemented. In this topic, we're going to disscuss the advantages and disadvantages for both ways of communications. The online meeting can introduce a significant impact to the organization while face to face meeting can be outdated for this new era of 2021.First of all for the online communication's advantages is that in the pandemic period the actual physical contact is a significant way to transmit the disease. Video conference can help mitigate this problem by lower the physical contact for each conversation or meeting. Also communicates through online channel can help individual to organize or manage their time efficiently according to each person preference. For example, a single mom parent may be able to spend times for her sons/daughters at home, while be able to have a cross country meeting with another department in other region. Another reason is that some people are quite introvert and find it difficult for face to face human interactions or conversations, in which online chat or messages can help them to mitigate this problem and communicate efficiently. Lastly as mentioned about video conference across region, online meeting can help the multi-national corporates save the transporations cost and additional resources needed to spend for face to face meeting.For the disadvantages, all of the online communications required hardware, internet connection and technological knowledge on how to use them. This technological gap can be seen as one of the most significant obstracle or disadvantage for people to use online communications. For example, in one company, there obviously have a various age of people, in which some of them are not familiar with the technology. Since video call conference has been introduced and utilized widespread among corporates not so long time ago. This can be a big technological gap for some people to use the online communications and result in a lost in communications among the workplaces.As a result, online communication helps an organization to reduce the risk of transmitting the disease, improved the time mangement ability and productivity for each individuals, and lower the financial cost or resources required to spends for international business activities. With all these advantages of online communication stated, they can be seens as a significant reasons to outweight the disadvantages of technological gap on this current year of 2021.;The transition to online communication in professional environments has become increasingly common. While some people highlight the numerous benefits of this trend, others point out its potential drawbacks. In this essay, I will explore both the positive and negative aspects of online communication in the workplace, ultimately arguing that its advantages surpass its disadvantages.On one hand, online communication presents several benefits. Primarily, it offers enhanced flexibility and convenience, allowing employees to interact and respond to messages at any time and from any location. This is particularly advantageous for teams with members in different time zones or those who work remotely. Additionally, online communication minimizes the necessity for lengthy meetings, enabling employees to concentrate on their work and thereby boosting productivity.Conversely, there are drawbacks associated with online communication. For example, it can result in misunderstandings and miscommunication, as non-verbal cues and tone are often absent in digital interactions. Furthermore, reliance on online communication can contribute to feelings of social isolation and diminish team cohesion, depriving employees of face-to-face interactions and personal connections.Nonetheless, I contend that the benefits of online communication outweigh its disadvantages. With technological advancements, online communication tools have evolved, offering features like video conferencing and screen sharing that can help address issues related to miscommunication and social isolation. Additionally, in today’s globalized market, where teams are frequently located in various countries and time zones, online communication has become essential for businesses striving to remain competitive. In conclusion, the advantages of online communication—such as increased flexibility and productivity—significantly outweigh its drawbacks, making it a vital component of modern workplaces.
1265;In recent years, the family structure has changed, as well as family roles. What are the changes occurring? Do you think these changes are positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In our modern days, families had witnessed a considerable change regarding their structure and the roles of individuals inside it. These changes are mainly the patriarchal structure that was dominating families in the past compared to a more balanced arrangement nowadays. In addition to that, there are more freedom and rights for women in recent years. And I believe its an advantageous development.Fathers used to be the only leaders of the families of past decades, however in recent days mothers had shared the leadership and started taking part in family decisions just like their partners. Also during recent decades women obtained greater deal of their civil rights which allowed them to take different roles from those that were common for females in the past decades. As an example, women can now own the family house, sign important documents, drive cars which were a breakthrough for women to be able to participate in family plannings and decisions.It appears to be an advantage to have women being able to be effective members of their families, that is because they can share responsibility, add their feminine qualities to the lives of their families as well as for them to be able to fulfill their own life by feeling the importance of their existence and their roles.As in a recent research that found families with women in them are happier, more content, and definitely healthier.In conclusion, the family system nowadays differs vastly from before, owing to the more roles that women are taking, and to the more rights and freedom they gained, and in my perspective it is a positive change.;In recent years, the traditional family unit has experienced considerable transformations, resulting in a shift in family dynamics. One of the most striking developments is the rise in single-parent households and blended families. As more women pursue careers and achieve financial independence, the traditional role of the male breadwinner has diminished. Furthermore, the increasing acceptance of same-sex marriages and families has broadened the definition of what constitutes a traditional family.I believe these evolutions are largely beneficial. They signify a more equal and adaptable society, where individuals have the freedom to make personal choices regarding their lives and relationships. For instance, single mothers are no longer facing societal stigma and are successfully raising well-rounded children. Additionally, the increase in dual-income families has allowed for a better standard of living and more opportunities for children.Another advantageous aspect of these shifts is the reevaluation of traditional gender roles. Men are becoming more active participants in parenting and household responsibilities, while women are advancing in their careers and taking on leadership positions. This transformation has fostered a more equitable distribution of tasks within families. While some might contend that these changes result in a decline in family values and stability, I maintain that the benefits of a more adaptable and inclusive family structure far exceed any potential downsides.In summary, the alterations in family structures and roles reflect a natural adaptation to the changing needs and values of society. Although there may be challenges that accompany these transformations, I view them as overwhelmingly positive, representing a society that is more equal, flexible, and inclusive. As families continue to develop, it is crucial to acknowledge and support the diverse array of family structures and roles, and to ensure the availability of resources and services that address the needs of all families, regardless of their composition.
1399;In some countries children have very strict rules of behavior, in other countries they are allowed to do almost anything they like. To what extent should children have to follow rules?;Freedom plays a pivotal role in everybody’s life. We can see in today’s modernized era that nobody likes to be restricted, whether it is a child or an adult. Some people think that there should some strict rules of behavior for children, but I disagree with this statement.that sometimes more restrictions can cause more frustration in children, which leads to many other mental problems as well. they can . Sometimes they feel under pressure, which can be the main reason for their poor performance in their field. In some cases children may insist on doing .In other words we have to look other aspects as well, if we usually ignore our children’s bad habits, then they good human beings in their future life. Moreover if we never draw attention the children’s main activities then they might end up in a bad company. They the value of respect for their elders importance of relationships. They their cultural values as well.In a nutshell, I would like to say that children should be the value of their customs, rituals and respect towards their elders for their future life, but most of the additional restriction should . It would good human beings in their future.;The discussion surrounding how much structure children should adhere to has ignited fervent debate worldwide. Some nations impose strict codes of conduct for children, while others take a more relaxed stance, allowing for greater freedom. I believe that children should be guided by rules to a certain degree, as this is crucial for their development and overall well-being.On one side, strict rules can instill a sense of discipline and accountability in children. By adhering to guidelines, they acquire vital life skills such as respecting authority, exercising self-control, and managing their time effectively. For example, having rules about bedtime, completing homework, and limiting screen time can promote healthy habits and help children prioritize their education. Additionally, these rules can serve as a protective measure, ensuring their safety and security.Conversely, granting children excessive freedom can positively impact their emotional and psychological growth. Allowing them to make decisions and embrace risks can encourage independence, creativity, and self-assurance. It can also aid in developing their problem-solving abilities as they learn from their experiences. However, a total lack of boundaries can lead to disorder and confusion, which may hinder a child's development.In summary, I contend that children should adhere to rules to a reasonable extent. Striking a balance between structure and freedom is vital for their holistic development. Parents, educators, and caregivers should create clear guidelines and limits while also enabling children to make choices and learn from their actions. By achieving this equilibrium, children can evolve into responsible, independent, and well-rounded individuals prepared for success in life. Ultimately, the objective is to find a middle ground that allows children to flourish while imparting essential life skills.
681;In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development;Nowadays, many businesses have to compete each other in order to survive from the rapidly changing world, leading to the high amount of time that employees spend on working. There are also other reasons why the employees work for a long period which I will discuss in this essay. In terms of consequences, I personally believe that spending most of our time at work is the negative development.It is the fact that people have various rationales to work for long hours. A classic example is the dynamic working condition. There are many companies that provide services such as consultation to customers, meaning that if their service does not completely satisfy the clients’ need, such client may decide to use the service from other competitors. Hence, the employees are required to dedicate their time to deliver the best service to the clients. Another common criticism is a bright career path. When the employees work for a long period, they can carefully check their works and, as a result, delivery the works with less mistakes. Doing this way could impress their manager and they are likely to get promotion in return.With a careful consideration regarding the consequence of working for long hours, there are many vital drawbacks. An obvious effect is the increase in illness. People who work very hard have to spend a lot of their time at work. Therefore, they may not have enough time to do exercises, weakening the immune system of their body. Furthermore, with the rise in the amount of working hours, people tend to lack social skills. This is because they may not be able to manage time to join social events or meet their friends, resulting in the less ability to adapt to new environments.In conclusion, it is undeniable that people work for long hours because of the requirement in business and personal career goal which, in my opinion, leads to negative development for themselves. This is because this behavior negatively affects their health condition and social competency which are the two most important aspects in our life.;"In numerous countries, it has become commonplace for individuals to work extended hours, often surpassing the traditional eight-hour workday. This trend can be linked to various factors. Chief among them is the competitive atmosphere of the global market, where companies strive to outperform one another by prioritizing productivity and efficiency. Consequently, employees frequently find themselves putting in additional hours to meet deadlines and reach objectives.Cultural expectations also play a significant role in the prevalence of long working hours. In certain societies, dedicating long days to work is perceived as indicative of diligence and loyalty; employees who go the extra mile are often rewarded with promotions and bonuses. Furthermore, advancements in technology have blurred the boundaries between work and personal life, making it easier for employees to remain connected to their jobs and be expected to be available around the clock.Despite these justifications, the trend of extended working hours carries significant drawbacks. Prolonged hours can lead to both physical and mental fatigue, diminished productivity, and an unhealthy work-life balance. It can adversely affect employees' health, relationships, and overall well-being. Moreover, this situation can result in burnout, increased absenteeism, and employee turnover, all of which negatively impact organizational performance.In summary, while the rationale for long working hours might seem reasonable, the downsides far exceed any potential advantages. It is crucial for businesses and governments to acknowledge the significance of fostering a healthy work-life balance and to implement strategies that prevent employee burnout. By promoting flexible working hours, ensuring sufficient breaks, and encouraging workers to prioritize their health, we can cultivate a more sustainable and productive work environment that benefits both employees and employers alike."
101;In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .;Over decades, there has been a belief that adults should support adolescents to work in a company or travel to another country at least one year before going to university. Despite the fact that there are many positive aspects of having experiences in terms of working and travelling before studying at university, with a careful consideration, there are also negative points of this.It is true that working or travelling before starting a university program positively affects juveniles’ development. A classic example of this is an effective way to truly understand their academic preferences. When juveniles have work experiences, such as having a one-year internship in a company, they tend to learn a wide variety of work functions, helping them know the academic discipline they want to learn at university. Another benefit from taking a long journey to another place before studying at university is the opportunity to get exposed to new culture. This is because while adolescents are on an epic expedition to other parts of the world, they tend to meet new people with different nationality and belief, leading to valuable life experiences that they cannot receive from a professor at university.In spite of the aforementioned advantages of working or travelling before starting university courses, there are also drawbacks. A common example of this is graduating from a college late, compared to juveniles who immediately start a university program after they finish high school. This is exemplified by Thai culture which believes that young people who graduate from university later than their peer would not have a successful career path. In addition, opponents of this notion might argue that working before finishing university is not well worth doing. Since most works require a strong academic foundation in order for juveniles to deliver results with fewer mistakes, the juveniles should study at university instead.In conclusion, it is undeniable that having work experiences or taking a journey before starting a university life has many benefits for young people with respect to knowing the academic fields they want to study and learning new cultures outside a classroom. Nevertheless, doing this could also have drawbacks in terms of the delay in university graduation and an ineffective performance in working.;A gap year, which refers to the period between completing high school and beginning university, has gained popularity among young individuals in various countries. During this time, many choose to work or travel to acquire life experiences and expand their perspectives. This essay will explore the benefits and drawbacks of taking a gap year.On one hand, there are numerous advantages to taking a gap year. Primarily, it offers young people the chance to gain valuable work experience, which can enhance their future career prospects. Many students opt to intern or volunteer, allowing them to develop skills and expand their professional networks. Additionally, traveling during this year offers the chance to immerse oneself in different cultures, meet new people, and foster independence. Moreover, stepping away from academic pressures can give students the opportunity to recharge and refocus, ultimately leading to improved academic performance in university.Conversely, there are several disadvantages to consider. A significant concern is that taking a gap year can disrupt the academic momentum. Some students may struggle to re-establish their study habits after a year off, potentially affecting their performance in higher education. Furthermore, delaying university enrollment can result in extended graduation timelines, which might place students at a disadvantage in an increasingly competitive job market. Additionally, the costs associated with traveling or maintaining independence during a gap year can pose a considerable financial challenge for many.In conclusion, while a gap year can be a beneficial experience, offering opportunities for practical learning, cultural exposure, and personal growth, it also presents certain challenges, such as the risk of losing academic momentum and financial implications. Ultimately, the decision to take a gap year should be based on individual circumstances and priorities. With thoughtful planning and decision-making, a gap year can become a fulfilling and transformative experience that equips young people for their future academic and professional endeavors.
1304;In some countries, boys and girls are educated separately after the age of about ten years old. Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;In many countries around the world, boys and girls are educated together. There is a group of countries, however, that educate boys and girls separately. This is frequently done on religious grounds, but not always. Having such a system can produce various advantages and disadvantages.One of the principal reasons for educating boys and girls separately is that, if they are together, they can distract each other. After puberty, boys can be strongly attracted to girls and vice versa, and this can result in disruptive conduct in the classroom as, for example, they show off to one another. Separating boys and girls can therefore have the distinct advantage of reducing this disturbing behaviour. However, some teachers have pointed out that this model does not always work, and that separated boys and girls are equally disruptive in class, and sometimes more so. These teachers say that having the opposite sex in the classroom can actually improve behaviour.Many educators also believe that boys and girls have different learning styles and needs. Separating boys and girls can allow teachers to address these needs more easily. There is also a belief that single sex schools allow gender stereotypes to be challenged and therefore education aspirations can be broadened.A major disadvantage of separating boys and girls in education is that the children miss important formative behavioural development when they do not have interaction with the other gender on a regular basis. This can lead to shyness and, more seriously, dysfunctional relationships later in life. Some people also feel that mixed sex schools can promote gender stereotypes rather than reducing them.In conclusion, I feel that children should be educated all together, although I would respect a system in which they are separated due to religious beliefs. My personal opinion is that different genders should learn to interact together from an early age, as this would allow them to develop healthy working relationships with each other.;The practice of segregating boys and girls in educational settings after the age of ten is prevalent in some countries. Advocates of this system argue that single-sex education enhances learning, improves discipline, and minimizes distractions. They believe that boys and girls possess different learning styles, and separating them allows for more personalized teaching approaches.However, I vehemently oppose this perspective. I contend that co-education, where boys and girls learn alongside one another, offers greater benefits for several reasons. Firstly, it fosters socialization and cultivates vital life skills such as communication, teamwork, and conflict resolution. In a co-educational environment, students engage with each other, thereby preparing them for the real world, where they will interact with individuals of all genders. For instance, in numerous Western countries, co-education is standard, and students from these systems tend to be more confident, open-minded, and adept at navigating relationships and challenges in both their personal and professional spheres.Moreover, separating boys and girls can reinforce stereotypes and perpetuate gender biases. In a single-sex educational framework, students may miss the chance to learn from and appreciate the viewpoints of the opposite sex, resulting in a limited and skewed perspective. Additionally, it can foster unrealistic expectations and sustain outdated gender roles, negatively impacting both boys and girls.In summary, while the concept of segregating boys and girls in education may seem attractive, I firmly assert that co-education is far more advantageous. It equips students for the real world, encourages social interaction, and helps dismantle gender stereotypes. Therefore, I believe educational institutions should prioritize creating a balanced and inclusive learning environment where boys and girls can learn together and benefit from one another's experiences.
785;In some countries, only few young people go to classical music concerts or or play classical music. Why? Should young people be encouraged to attend and learn more?;Classical music is one of the oldest artistic samples of our history. However, the young people of the new generations do not appreciate this kind of music. I believe that governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and I will support my stand with valid arguments in the following paragraphs.First of all, the main reason behind the little interest of young people in classical music is the impact of globalization in music and arts. That is because people have the opportunity to know more about multiple things without leaving their homes. However, all this knowledge is only superficial and arts, more specifically classical music, is diminished by the big international industry of music. For instance, reggaeton music, despite the fact that its lyrics are often misogynous, is the most popular style of music these days.Another reason is that children and young people have less interest in cultural matters than in the past because governments do not invest in culture and arts. In most countries, investment in culture has been drastically reduced and young people have no access to classical music concerts and much less a musical instrument that has a huge cost. Consequently, governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and the arts.To summarise, this essay has examined the idea of classical music and why young people do not have an interest in this kind of music. As far as I am concerned governments should take responsibility in this matter and invest more money in culture and classical music encouraging young people to learn more about this kind of art.;The declining interest among young people in classical music is a trend observed in many countries, driven by multiple factors. A key contributor is the limited exposure to classical music during their formative years. In contrast to pop or rock music, which is widely available and easily accessible, classical music tends to be featured in specialized concerts or events, which may not resonate with younger audiences. Additionally, the intricate nature of classical compositions can be intimidating, giving the impression that this genre is inaccessible or dull.Another influencing factor is the rise of modern technology and social media, which has shifted entertainment preferences. Today's youth are typically drawn to music that is catchy, upbeat, and easily shareable, rather than the complex and subtle pieces found in classical music. Additionally, classical music is often associated with elitism and outdated cultural norms, which may further discourage young individuals from engaging with this genre.However, it is crucial to inspire young people to learn about and experience classical music. This genre offers numerous advantages, including enhancements to cognitive abilities, encouragement of creativity, and promotion of cultural appreciation. Moreover, engaging with classical music provides an excellent opportunity for young people to hone their critical thinking and emotional intelligence. By integrating classical music into schools, community centers, and online platforms, we can enhance accessibility and interest among the younger generation. Organizing workshops, concerts, and interactive events can also help dismantle the barriers and highlight the diversity and richness of classical music. Such efforts will help preserve classical music as a vibrant and relevant aspect of our cultural heritage, allowing young people to recognize and enjoy its beauty and significance.
1334;In the modern world, it is possible to shop, work and communicate with people via the Internet and live without any face-to-face contact with others. Is it a positive or negative development?;The feasibility of shopping, working and communicating through the Internet is gradually eliminating the necessity of in-person encounters. I believe the merits of this opportunity outnumber its demerits and the lowered volume of traffic in addition to the possibility of long-range communication will be discussed as reasons for this claim in this essay.One chief benefit of using the Internet as a means of making purchases, working and communicating would be the lowered demand for transport, through eradicating the need for face-to-face contact. Such decreased volume of transportation would result in fewer harmful gas emissions which could significantly contribute to creating a cleaner environment. Furthermore, reduced commuting burden yields more free time for individuals. It could be spent in various ways such as working, studying and socialising with family and friends to name a few, which would be more productive and enjoyable.Another key merit of using the Internet would be the emergence of state-of-the-art telecommunication applications. These technologies have made it possible for those with access to the Internet to get in touch and send and receive audiovisual content by pushing just a few buttons. This presents a stark contrast to the situation only a few decades ago, when long-distance communication was possible solely through paper-based letters, which could possibly take months to reach the recipient.There are, however, some drawbacks to online communication, in particular the possibility that the lack of contact brought by technological advancements could potentially weaken human bonds. Taking into consideration that humans are sociable species, this could pose a dire threat to our mental health. This predicament, however, would be mitigated by the extra free time technological developments create for us. This free time could be spent with friends and family and in the long run would strengthen our relationships and improve our emotional wellbeing.To recapitulate, the Internet’s demolishing the need for person-to-person contact brings about numerous benefits. A more sustainable environment as well as more free time generated for individuals, a reduced need to commute in addition to the feasibility of conducting long-distance communication in the easiest way possible, are all instances of the above-mentioned merits.;The rise of the internet has transformed how we live, work, and connect with one another. With just a click, we can shop, work, and communicate with people from around the world without having to leave our homes or engage in in-person interactions. While this technological advancement offers many advantages, including greater convenience and accessibility, I believe it carries a negative impact.Firstly, the decline in face-to-face interactions can result in social isolation and loneliness. As inherently social beings, we thrive on personal connections. Extended periods of isolation can harm our mental and emotional well-being. Additionally, the absence of nonverbal communication—such as body language and facial expressions—can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations, negatively affecting both personal and professional relationships.Secondly, the internet has diminished essential social skills such as communication, empathy, and conflict resolution. Without face-to-face interactions, we may find it challenging to cultivate these crucial abilities, which are vital for fostering and sustaining meaningful relationships. Furthermore, an over-dependence on digital communication can contribute to a decrease in deep, meaningful conversations and a decline in emotional intelligence.In summary, although the internet has certainly enhanced our convenience, I assert that the lack of personal interaction is a detrimental development. It's vital that we find a balance between our online and offline lives and make a deliberate effort to foster regular in-person interactions to support our social, emotional, and mental health. By doing so, we can enjoy the benefits of the internet while still nurturing our intrinsic need for human connection.
1344;In the past people wore their traditional clothes, but these days most people wear similar clothes, is this a positive or negative development?;In the past, people wore their traditional clothes and followed their culture. These days, most people wear similar clothes and therefore look very similar to one another. Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?Sample EssayThese days, people’s perspectives on the value of clothing are changing, and individuals tend to wear similar clothing compared to people in the past who opted for their traditional clothing. I believe this tendency exerts a positive influence on the society.It is certainly true that there are some drawbacks to this tendency because it may lead to a loss of global diversity. It can be argued those who wear ordinary clothes such as T-shirts and jeans cannot feel a connection to their roots, and they are likely to neglect their culture and the contribution of their ancestors. Therefore, these people may not take pride in their region, and they might migrate to an urban location rather than contribute to the development of their community. Consequently, many ethnic minorities could suffer from depopulation and eventually disappear.However, I believe that there are more positives than negatives in people opting for similar clothes. The first explanation is that individuals can feel a sense of unity with people all over the world even though they have different religions and ways of life. This would motivate people in the world to support one another, instead of thinking that different parts of the world should deal with their own problems when natural disasters and other terrible problems occur in different nations. Furthermore, this tendency is economically profitable. Generally speaking, as ordinary clothes are automatically manufactured, they can be produced faster and more affordably than traditional clothing such as Japanese Kimono, which is hand-crafted.In conclusion, although people today tend to wear similar clothes instead of traditional ones and this trend cause several problems, I believe that the society as a whole can reap more benefits of this tendency.All parts of the task have been covered. The writer presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt with suitable, widely covered and sufficiently supported ideas. The paragraphing is handled appropriately. The range of vocabulary allows the writer to convey the intended meaning. The overall control of grammar and punctuation is fine, with only a few errors mostly related to word choice (hover/tap on corrections in blue for details). Well done! Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;The transition from traditional clothing to modern, uniform styles is a trend observed around the world. In earlier times, individuals took great pride in donning their traditional garments, which often embodied their cultural heritage and identity. However, globalization and modernization have significantly altered dressing habits.On the positive side, this trend can enhance global communication and interaction, allowing individuals from diverse cultures to connect and understand one another more easily. It fosters a sense of unity and equality, as people from various backgrounds are seen wearing similar outfits. Additionally, modern clothing tends to be more practical and comfortable, making it well-suited for everyday wear.Conversely, this shift has negative implications as well. The decline of traditional attire has contributed to a loss of cultural diversity and uniqueness, diminishing the ability to identify individuals by their clothing. Traditional garments often carry deep cultural and historical significance, and their fading presence signifies a loss of cultural heritage. Moreover, the standardization of clothing styles has led to the rise of fast fashion, which brings about detrimental environmental and social consequences.In summary, while the move towards similar clothing styles offers benefits such as fostering unity and practicality, it also presents challenges, including a decline in cultural diversity and the adverse effects of fast fashion. Striking a balance between modernity and tradition is crucial, enabling individuals to honor and wear their traditional attire on special occasions while also embracing modern styles that are comfortable and functional.
641;"Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference. To what extent do you agree or disagree?";There is no doubt these days that the action of the individual is not powerful enough to make the environment better. Unless through laws created by the government and activities have been taken by companies that have a high impact. I strongly disagree with this idea. because there are other ways to help the government as an individual.In essay will prove my point with reasons and examples.Nowadays, people can use social media as a platform that has the power to tell people around the world how to behave. Therefore, an individual has the power to convince others to give higher attention to our environment and create a community that has specific goals to improve. For example, social media influencers could educate the volunteer and work with the youth to make the environment better. For instance, show the young people how to sort the waste and how dangerous the impact is if they do not act in such as way.Moreover, as individuals, people can start doing many actions which benefit the environment by themselves without obstructions. On the other hand, the government and companies should be aware too. For example, while the companies use the factories the government must be monitoring the discharge of fule.In conclusion, after carefully explaining my points of view, in my opinion, it is not necessary to wait for the government and the big companies to act activity for the environment because we as individuals can create and provide educational activities for the public to preserve the environment for the next generation.;I firmly reject the notion that individuals are powerless in improving the environment and that only governments and large corporations can effect change. Although it's undeniable that these entities wield considerable influence due to their resources and scale, individual actions can also drive meaningful positive change.By integrating environmentally conscious practices into their everyday lives—such as reducing energy usage, utilizing public transport, recycling, and conserving water—individuals can make a notable difference. Additionally, making mindful purchasing decisions, like choosing sustainable products with minimal packaging or supporting locally sourced goods, can help lower one's carbon footprint while bolstering the local economy.Moreover, individuals have the ability to inspire others, creating a ripple effect through the sharing of their knowledge and eco-friendly practices with friends, family, and their communities. This can spark grassroots movements that pressure both governments and corporations to adopt more sustainable policies. Engaging in local environmental initiatives, such as cleanup drives, tree planting events, and conservation projects, can also create significant positive impacts on the surrounding environment.In summary, while governmental and corporate efforts are crucial in safeguarding our environment, it's vital for individuals to recognize the power of their actions. Small changes in daily habits and decision-making can contribute to a larger push toward sustainability and environmental stewardship. Therefore, acknowledging the significance of individual contributions and fostering a sense of responsibility for our environmental impact is essential.
1237;"Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.";"Pollution free environment is important for our life's health and even enjoyement.Everyone whether an individual or large entitiy has an impact on the environment; regardless whether it was good or bad. Hence, I believe it is the responsibility of individulas as well as governments and large companies.Individuals can do a lot to improve the environemt around them starting with taking some actions to make a difference. For example, every memeber in the sociaty can support recycling efforts by sorting their garbages into different categoreis, instead of wasting the efforts of recycling companies to do so. Another exmaple would be to stop using plastic products and replace them with more environemt friendly products like pepar products.Moreover, teaching and spreading awarness about the importance of keeping our environemt clean are another way to make a difference. For instance, we can use social media to spread awarness and start campaigns about enviorment and pollution. Furthermore, we can teach some classes in schools and universities about this subject. As a result, this will help the upcoming generations to understand the problem and have them continue the efforts of improvement.While individuals efforts are essential, they must be supported by governments and large companies in order to complete the circle. A main example here would be establishing regulations and laws that would minimze the damage to the environment and maintain pollution at low levels, which is the role of the governments around the world. As for large companies, they can support by adopting the best practicies and take the proper actions to reduce pollution and improve the environment. As an example, they can start using clean and renewable energies to power their facilities and plants. In addition, those companies can develop technologies that contributes toward keeping the environment safe, and prompet the use of clean energy and vehicales.To sum up, the responsibility to improve the environemt must be divided between all three parties individuals, governments, and large companies. Each has his role to enhnace the environemnt and reduce the pollution. They complete each other and they should work together toward a better future for our world.";"I firmly reject the notion that individuals are powerless in their ability to improve the environment, with only governments and large corporations able to effect change. While it's true that these entities have a considerable impact, individuals also have a vital role in protecting and preserving our planet.There are countless ways individuals can contribute positively to the environment. Simple efforts, like conserving energy, recycling, and utilizing public transportation, can collectively yield significant results. Moreover, individuals can make mindful decisions regarding their purchases, opting for sustainable and eco-friendly products whenever possible. Additionally, engaging in local environmental efforts, such as community clean-up drives and conservation initiatives, can greatly enhance the local ecosystem.A prime example of individual impact is the ""reduce, reuse, recycle"" movement, initiated by concerned individuals and now embraced worldwide. This initiative encourages people to cut back on single-use plastics, find new uses for items, and recycle as much as possible, resulting in notable reductions in plastic waste and heightened awareness around sustainability.In summary, while governments and large corporations undoubtedly play crucial roles in environmental protection, I assert that individuals can also create meaningful change. Through everyday actions and thoughtful choices, we can all contribute to a more sustainable future. Therefore, I strongly contest the statement and affirm that individual efforts can lead to significant and positive transformations."
1301;It is a fact that the majority of people who are sent to prison commit further crime after their release.What is causing this? What can be done to change this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is a sad fact that criminals who leave prison go on to commit further crime. There are various reasons for this, but there are also some things that can be done to prevent it from happening.One reason for this recidivism is due to a lack of legitimate income. Many people turn to crime as they cannot find an alternative to earn money. When such person comes out of prison, it is very often the case that they have the same few opportunities for a legitimate income. In fact, these opportunities will even be reduced, as employers are often less willing to give an ex-prisoner a job. Some people also return to crime, as they spend all the time of their prison sentence with other criminals. This is not a great environment for rehabilitation, and sometimes even a network of contacts can be made to help develop criminal activities on release.One important way to help address this problem is education. Criminals who have turned to illegal activities because of no alternatives to earn a living need to learn a way to earn a wage, such as a trade or vocational skills. Computer skills, for example, are in high demand and someone trained in these could very possibly find work. In addition, governments can offer incentives to employers to attract them to give jobs to newly-released prisoners. This would help people who don’t really want to return to crime achieve a fresh start. As keeping people in prison is an expensive business, governments might find it cheaper to pay these incentives.To sum up, people returning to crime is a tragedy that should be avoided if at all possible in today’s society. Education and incentives can directly address the reasons for it and could make society a happier and safer place.;The elevated recidivism rates among former inmates represent a significant challenge within the criminal justice system. Research indicates that a substantial proportion of those released from incarceration tend to reoffend, thus continuing a cycle of imprisonment and relapse. This issue is the result of various interconnected factors, including insufficient rehabilitation programs, a lack of social support, and restricted job opportunities.One key contributor to recidivism is the failure of correctional facilities to implement effective rehabilitation initiatives. Many prisons prioritize punishment over rehabilitation, which leaves inmates without the essential skills and assistance needed for successful reintegration into society. For example, studies have shown that inmates who engage in vocational training and counseling are notably less likely to reoffend compared to those who do not participate in such programs. This underscores the critical need to provide incarcerated individuals with access to education, vocational training, and mental health services to empower them to pursue lawful lives.Another major factor behind recidivism is the absence of social support and community connections. Former convicts often encounter stigma and discrimination, making it difficult for them to find jobs and rebuild relationships with family and friends. Addressing this issue through community-driven initiatives, such as mentorship programs and support networks, can offer ex-offenders positive influences and facilitate their reintegration into society.To break the cycle of recidivism, it is essential for governments and correctional institutions to emphasize rehabilitation and reintegration strategies. This may involve investing in evidence-based programs, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and job training, while also offering ex-convicts assistance in accessing education, employment, and social services upon their release. By adopting a comprehensive approach to corrections, we can aim to lower recidivism rates and foster safer, more supportive environments for everyone.
1336;It is believed that people who read for pleasure develop their imagination more and acquire better language skills compared to people who prefer watching television. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Some people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. Personally, I support this opinion for several reasons, which will be laid out in this essay.As we all know, books use text to convey ideas and quite often there are no images or illustrations to picture the scenes described in the book; therefore, we have to use our own imagination while reading. For example, reading a fantasy novel that contains mythical creatures one would normally see the appearance of those characters in their mind while following the plot. In contrast, movie heroes on a TV screen are usually created for the viewer by directors and producers of the film. Watching TV substitutes the need to develop one’s own imagination because the characters and their surroundings are shown on the screen.Furthermore, it is argued that reading is the best way to expand one’s vocabulary. The reader learns the correct spelling of a word by seeing it printed in a book, and they grasp its meaning from the context, without having to look it up in a dictionary. Not only new words but also numerous sentence structures can be learnt from books. To take advantage of these benefits English teachers in many schools use English novels as teaching materials. Students are asked to read the story and capture the keywords to answer the questions in the exam. In comparison, learning new words while watching a TV show isn’t always easy because the viewer’s attention is drawn to the action on the screen and if there are no subtitles, the spelling of the words is not obvious. All this makes a book a more effective tool for a language learner compared to TV.In conclusion, I believe people who love to read tend to have a more active imagination and advanced linguistic comprehension than those who watch television, since readers are required to imagine the story in the book and learn the meaning of new words from the context.";The idea that individuals who engage in reading for enjoyment develop their imagination and language skills more effectively than those who favor watching television is a topic of considerable debate. Personally, I largely support this viewpoint. Research indicates that reading for pleasure significantly contributes to cognitive growth, especially in enhancing creativity and language acquisition.Firstly, reading actively engages the mind, requiring readers to visualize characters, settings, and events. This mental engagement fosters imagination, spurring creativity and innovation. Additionally, reading introduces a wide range of vocabulary, grammatical structures, and linguistic nuances that can significantly improve language proficiency. Readers encounter diverse writing styles, genres, and dialects, enriching their linguistic knowledge.Conversely, watching television tends to be a more passive experience, as viewers are presented with a ready-made visual narrative that demands less cognitive effort. While television can expose audiences to some language through dialogue, it often lacks the depth and complexity found in written material. Furthermore, visual elements in TV shows can dampen the viewer's imaginative involvement since the story is already depicted visually.That said, it is important to recognize that certain television programs, such as documentaries and educational content, can offer valuable insights and stimulate imagination. Nonetheless, I strongly believe that reading for pleasure is a more effective way to cultivate imagination and language skills. Ultimately, the advantages of reading—such as improved imagination and linguistic capabilities—render it an essential pursuit for cognitive development and personal enrichment.
753;It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;"Nowadays a lot of primary schools are starting to introduce the teaching of animal care and general agriculture. Many people think that primary children should study and understand how to grow vegetables and keep animals; this essay will discuss why primary school should learn about this two arguments and how the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.It is very important study and understand how to grow vegetables and how to keep animals, especially in a younger age. Most of the kids, that frequent the primary school, have this desire of having a pet and, the opportunity of studying how to take care of it in the school, can make the child more aware of the responsibilities that he will have if, one day, he has to own one of them. At the same time, for a primary children it's also important to understand how vegetables grown and what's the process behind that , learning about this arguments will help the kids to appreciate more the food and, as a consequence, in the future there will be less waste of it .It's clear that the advantages will be more than the disadvantages, if there are any. If every kid will know more about the arguments, the world in the future will become a better place, with more respect for the animals and more appreciation for the vegetables that, will also help people to make a healthier life.In conclusion, this essay discussed on how the introduction of subjects like animal care and general understanding of how vegetables grow, will help the kids to become better adults in the future to make of this world a better place.";The proposal for primary school children to learn how to cultivate vegetables and care for animals has ignited a discussion regarding the potential advantages and disadvantages of this initiative. In my view, the benefits of imparting these skills to young students significantly surpass any drawbacks.On one side, the advantages of teaching children how to grow food and tend to animals are extensive. For example, these activities can instill essential life skills, such as responsibility, teamwork, and self-reliance. Engaging in the processes of planting, nurturing, and harvesting vegetables enables children to gain a richer understanding of food sources and the significance of sustainable practices. Additionally, caring for animals can nurture qualities like empathy, compassion, and a sense of responsibility toward the environment.Conversely, some might argue that adding these activities to the primary school curriculum could be time-intensive, expensive, and distracting from fundamental academic subjects. However, I would argue that these experiences can actually enhance traditional education. For instance, tasks like measuring plant growth or calculating the amount of animal feed required can reinforce mathematical principles. Furthermore, the practical, hands-on nature of these activities can make learning more exciting and enjoyable, potentially leading to better academic results.In summary, teaching primary children to grow vegetables and care for animals provides a host of benefits, ranging from developing vital life skills and promoting sustainability to enriching academic learning. While certain logistical obstacles may arise, they are far outweighed by the positive outcomes. By integrating these activities into the curriculum, we can cultivate a more responsible, compassionate, and environmentally aware future generation.
1296;It is the responsibility of individuals to save and provide for their own retirement. Governments have no obligation to provide this benefit.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The responsibility for providing funds for retirement is incredibly important and something that is often overlooked by younger people. Some believe it is the responsibility of the individual to plan for this, but others feel it is the responsibility of the state.People who believe that the state should be responsible for funding retirees, base their argument on the fact that in most countries, people pay taxes and social charges to the government. This money, they argue, should also go towards the provision of a pension for the person paying the tax. In addition, those who have very small or no income, pay little or no tax and do not have the ability to provide for themselves. The government, therefore, in its role of caring for the population, has an obligation to pay a pension and provide other social benefits, such as medical treatment.Many others, however, feel that it is the responsibility of individuals to fund their own retirements. As adults, they argue, people should be able to set aside and invest money throughout their lifetime, so that they can retire with few financial worries. In many countries the government has legislated a framework allowing and encouraging citizens to save up and accumulate sufficient funds for the period after their working years have ended.I neither agree nor disagree with the statement, but rather my opinion takes in parts of both arguments. I feel that people should be responsible for saving money to fund their retirement, but I also feel that individuals who have not had the chance to do so should be supported by the government out of taxes. In my view, therefore, it is wrong to say that governments have no obligation to help people in this area. Governments are there to support the entire population of their countries, which includes the poorer elements of society.;I partially disagree with the assertion that it is solely the responsibility of individuals to save for their retirement, and that governments have no duty to provide retirement benefits. While it is essential for individuals to actively engage in planning and saving for their retirement to maintain greater control over their financial future, there are compelling arguments for government involvement in retirement benefits.On one hand, individuals possess the capacity to make informed decisions regarding their financial planning, enabling them to prepare for retirement based on their unique situations and aspirations. When individuals bear the sole responsibility for their retirement savings, they are often more motivated to make wise financial choices, such as starting to save early, maintaining consistency, and selecting smart investment options.On the other hand, individuals can encounter significant obstacles in saving for retirement due to unforeseen circumstances like job loss, health crises, or limited income. In these instances, government support serves as a safety net, ensuring that retirees achieve a minimum standard of living. Countries with robust pension systems, such as Denmark and Sweden, exemplify how government-provided retirement benefits can greatly alleviate poverty among the elderly and foster social stability.Moreover, a government-funded retirement system can drive economic growth by ensuring that retirees have a stable income, which allows them to support local businesses and stimulate economic activity. Additionally, many individuals may lack the necessary financial literacy or access to suitable retirement savings options, making it challenging for them to plan effectively for their retirement. In these cases, government intervention can provide the essential guidance and support needed.In conclusion, while it is crucial for individuals to take charge of their retirement savings, governments also play an important role in helping ensure that citizens can enjoy a secure and dignified retirement. A collaborative approach, where both individuals and governments contribute to retirement planning, is likely to produce the best outcomes for retirees.
1287;It must be a woman who stays at home to care for children. Men are not suited to this kind of work. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Traditionally in many parts of the world, it has been women who have stayed at home to care for children. This has led to the ideology and expectation that women are more suited to this type of work than men.The overwhelming status quo where women stay at home to care for the children probably derives from the fact that women are the ones who have to actually give birth to children and, following that, they are the ones who for the early part of a child’s life have to feed the child until it is weaned. In times past, this state of affairs probably led to the women assuming the permanent role of carer for the home and children, whilst men went out to work, whether it was to gather food or work in fields or factories.In spite of the fact that this became what was expected in family dynamics, it does not mean that men are necessarily less suited to caring for a child than women. It is very possible for men to care for a child, even from birth onwards in today’s world. Babies’ milk formula can be mixed by anyone and fed to a child. The fact that many women today choose not to do this again does not mean that they are better suited by nature to care for the child.Suitability for childcare is a matter for individual temperament and aptitude. Not many people, whether they are men or women, feel totally confident and knowledgeable about how to care for a baby or young child at the start. They need advice from their own mothers and fathers, midwives or from books. It is only from experience that skill with childcare comes and this skill can be acquired regardless of gender.All in all, I do not agree with the statement that men are less suited to childcare than women. I believe that aptitude to look after children is a matter of individual temperament, not gender-specific inherited qualities.;I firmly reject the idea that only women should stay home to care for children and that men are not equipped for this role. This perspective is outdated and perpetuates damaging gender stereotypes. In modern society, it is no longer acceptable to view childcare as solely a woman’s responsibility. Men are equally capable of providing loving care and nurturing for their children.In fact, a growing number of men are actively engaging in childcare and proving to be outstanding caregivers. The emergence of stay-at-home dads highlights this trend, with more fathers seen pushing strollers, changing diapers, and participating in parent-teacher meetings. This shift in traditional gender roles benefits children, who thrive on the nurturing from both parents, and fosters deeper connections between fathers and their children.Research supports that engaged fathers positively influence their children's cognitive, emotional, and social development. Kids with involved fathers tend to excel academically, boast higher self-esteem, and exhibit fewer behavioral issues. This underscores the importance of male involvement in childcare and challenges the belief that men are unfit for this responsibility.Additionally, several countries, like Sweden and Denmark, have introduced policies that encourage fathers to take parental leave, resulting in a notable rise in men caring for their children at home. These policies not only foster greater equality within households but also lead to a more even distribution of childcare duties.In summary, the belief that childcare should be the exclusive domain of women and that men lack the capacity for this work is no longer valid. Men are just as qualified as women to provide high-quality care for their children, and their participation is crucial for their kids’ health and development. As society progresses, it is vital to confront and dismantle outdated gender norms and advocate for more equitable and flexible childcare roles.
1105;It's generally believed that success in fields such as art and sport can only be achieved if a person has natural talent. However, it's sometimes claimed that any child can be taught to become a good sports person or artist.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"It is common to think that in fields like art or sport success is linked to natural talent, even though it is stated that children can obtain good results also trough learning and pratice.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------In my opinion, I believe that only a combination of natural talent and sacrifice can lead you to obtain success; for this reason, you can learn and improve several skills, but you will not win against a person with this type of gift, unless this person does not pratice enough.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------To provide an example, if we think about Raffaello, one of the most remarkable painters of all times, and his life we may be disappointed; in fact, thanks to his natural talent he started to paint since he was 8.However, we have to bear in mind that he constantly made a research in order to discover new techniques and to gain new inspirations.If he was not so focused on his art's improvement, he would not be able to paint an entire church.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------If we move to another field as sport is always more evident the existence of a pattern. Indeed, it is crystal clear that professional players need to pratice everyday, regardless their talent.However, Ronaldo this year has winned the nominee for the best football player in the world not only for his innate talent but also for the effort put during training in order to reach always an higher goal.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------In conclusion, through commitment you will obtain good results, but to achieve the highest level you must be gifted with a natural talent.";"The ongoing discussion about the influence of natural talent on success in fields such as art and sports has generated considerable debate. Many people hold the belief that innate ability is essential for excelling in these domains. Advocates of this viewpoint contend that genetics and innate skills significantly impact an individual’s potential for success. For example, a child born with an athletic physique or a natural eye for design may initially have an edge in sports or art.Conversely, some argue that any child can be trained to become adept in sports or the arts with the right commitment and guidance. This stance highlights the importance of nurture, asserting that consistent practice, constructive feedback, and professional mentorship can enable individuals to hone the skills required for success. A compelling illustration of this is the story of Stephen Wiltshire, an artist diagnosed with autism, who developed his drawing and painting abilities through rigorous practice and training, despite lacking conventional artistic gifts at the beginning.In my view, while innate talent may offer an initial benefit, it is not the only factor influencing success in art or sports. With diligence, perseverance, and effective training, individuals can cultivate the necessary skills to thrive in these areas. Additionally, the notion of ""talent"" is often subjective and shaped by numerous factors, including access to resources, social support, and personal drive. Thus, I believe that both nature and nurture contribute to success, and that any child has the potential to become a capable athlete or artist with the right mindset and opportunities."
1420;Learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Evaluation of the importance of timing is essential, past to show the importance of their present, while that to even remember their past because it would not help them at all. It is a very controversial and complicated matter., many people believe this statement, for many reasons. Firstly, all of us had made many mistakes which we would not like to remember, they will affect their present because they can create some problems with our families example. Secondly, instead of remembering those past trials, one should get the benefits of their present.Regardless of what I said previously, many people are sticking to their past to give themselves a push in their present. It can give a way of learning from mistakes, and a good chance to try to avoid anything that once lead to a past failure.Moreover, success will not come without failure, everybody should make an attempt, even if it fails, and it may become a big success if they try it again and again. In addition, our past is our culture and heritage which we should not forget at all, it is a matter of value to our present and future, and will remain such till the day will die.To sum up, in my opinion, we can not live without a past, it is our value of life. it can help create your experiences and solve your problems better in the future.;I firmly believe that the claim that learning about history holds no relevance for those of us in the present is misguided. The study of history offers crucial insights and valuable lessons that we can directly apply to our contemporary lives. For example, by examining the ramifications of significant historical events like World War II, we can better equip ourselves to avert similar disasters in the future. Learning from the past allows us to recognize patterns and errors that culminated in catastrophic outcomes, empowering us to make more thoughtful choices in our current circumstances.Furthermore, understanding history enables us to appreciate the advancements and achievements across various sectors, including science, technology, and human rights. The civil rights movement in the United States illustrates the progress we have made regarding racial equality, while also highlighting the ongoing challenges we face. This awareness can inspire us to persist in our efforts toward a fairer and more just society.Additionally, history enriches our sense of cultural identity and community. By exploring our ancestors' traditions, customs, and accomplishments, we gain a deeper appreciation of our cultural heritage and its relevance today. This understanding fosters a sense of belonging and shared values, vital for cultivating strong, united communities.In summary, learning about history is crucial for those of us in the present. It equips us with important lessons, enhances our sense of cultural identity, and deepens our understanding of the complexities of human experiences. Through the study of history, we can broaden our perspectives, make informed decisions, and strive to create a brighter future for ourselves and generations to come.
1197;Learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Learning about the past may provide advantages and disadvantages, depending on the position we are situate ourselves in life ;Undoubtedly, it has great advantages for the ones who need to progress in life, despite what they had been through, because to my opinion, greatest lessons in life come with our own experiences. Advantages of learning about the past are also on the side of the ones who personally know themselves very well and stay honest to themselves at all times.For example, someone who try to be someone, acting to please influent people or trying to get somewhere he or she would not be able to if he were playing real, could be embarrassed by their own mistakes or feeling humiliated when looking back to what he accomplished to get where he/she is now ; therefore the past in this situation would not be a great option for him to look back after.Despite this kind of personality, there are lots of people who find out constructive knowledge in looking back to the past, regardless of how great or bad it could be.The kind of people who actually face their own past and do not try to hide it are the ones who are not scared of how people will judge them, but are willing to make greate changes in their future.It is ,to me, the definition of true progress; how could we learn from our own experiences if we are not willing to face ourselves ?Past can be hurtful but I do think that everything we have been through is a constructive lesson for today and tomorrow.";I wholeheartedly reject the notion that studying history holds no relevance for those of us in the present. Knowledge of the past is essential for navigating the complexities we face today and for building a brighter future. By examining history, we gain important insights into the repercussions of past decisions, learn from the achievements and mistakes of former generations, and develop a broader understanding of the cultural, social, and economic landscapes that shape our lives.For example, understanding events like World War II allows us to appreciate the significance of diplomacy, international collaboration, and the dire impacts of nationalism and prejudice. Likewise, exploring the Civil Rights Movement in the United States can enhance our understanding of current social justice issues, including racial inequality and discrimination. By reflecting on the past, we can pinpoint recurring patterns that affect our contemporary world and make more informed choices in tackling persistent challenges.Moreover, studying history nurtures empathy, tolerance, and cultural awareness. By delving into the stories and accomplishments of individuals from various backgrounds and eras, we can expand our viewpoints, question our beliefs, and gain a more intricate understanding of the human experience. In summary, the importance of learning about the past lies in its capacity to deepen our grasp of the present, guide our future decisions, and promote a more empathetic and knowledgeable global community. As such, I firmly assert that understanding history is of immense value to those of us living now.
1375;Many believe that international tourism is bad for their country (reasons and solutions);Many people believe that international tourism is a bad thing for their countries. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to change this negative attitude towards international tourism?Many individuals think that foreign tourism brings negative effects to their countries. There are several reasons for such negative attitude towards international travelers. However, a couple of solutions could be adopted to handle this situation, as will now be discussed.International tourists are often criticized for their contribution to the environmental degradation. It has continuously been noticed that they throw rubbish in their surroundings irresponsibly, which increases the amount of litter everywhere, despite all attempts to reduce waste produced by the local community. This contributes to water, air and soil contamination.Furthermore, foreign tourism has a harmful influence on traditional customs and indigenous practices of host countries because many tourists are careless and insensitive the emotions and feelings of local residents. For instance, in India, some foreign travelers wear inappropriate clothes or expose too much of skin when they visit sacred places, which leads to some negative attitude and the local public.However, this situation can be improved different solutions which could be handled by the government. The government should explain the benefits of international tourism which contributes to the development of local . They not only spend money in shops and restaurants but also create jobs in service industries, and this aspect could be publicized. Additionally, the government should increase the awareness among the foreigners through different media such as roadside billboards and advertisements, and tourists should be encouraged to get rid of rubbish correctly.In conclusion, the inhospitable feeling that the local people have for international tourists can be explained in many ways. However, in my opinion, the government’s involvement is essential to change the negative attitude by citing various advantages of international tourism to their country and raising awareness among tourists in order to protect local habitats.This essay covers the entire task topic by exploring both reasons for negative attitude towards international tourism and some possible actions to change it. The writer explains why locals may resent international tourists and suggests what steps can be taken to transform the way people feel about foreigners in their country. The information is well-organised by the use of paragraphing, and the writer moves from one idea to the next effortlessly, with the help of linking words. A wide range of vocabulary is used, including less common words such as “degradation”,”inhospitable”, “habitat”, “awareness” and “sacred”. Instances of inaccurate word choice are rare, and even these slips don’t cause difficulty for the reader. Overall, this looks like a Band 8 essay.;The debate surrounding the impact of international tourism on a nation's well-being is lively and complex. Many contend that an influx of foreign tourists negatively affects local environments, cultures, and economies. A primary concern is the pressure tourism places on natural resources such as water and energy, as heightened demand can lead to shortages and depletion, especially in regions with inadequate infrastructure.Additionally, tourism can contribute to cultural homogenization, resulting in the loss of local customs and traditions due to overwhelming external influences. The commercialization of cultural heritage sites and historical landmarks can diminish their original significance and authenticity. Furthermore, the tourism industry often prioritizes the needs of visitors over those of local residents, which can cause the displacement and marginalization of indigenous populations.To address these adverse effects, governments and tourism organizations can adopt sustainable tourism practices. This includes investing in environmentally friendly infrastructure, fostering cultural awareness and sensitivity among tourists, and supporting local businesses and communities. Additionally, implementing measures to manage tourist numbers and distribute them more evenly throughout the year can help alleviate pressure on resources and infrastructure.In essence, international tourism presents both economic opportunities and cultural challenges. However, through careful planning, management, and regulation, the negative consequences can be reduced, and the benefits can be shared fairly among local communities. By embracing a sustainable and responsible approach to tourism, countries can safeguard their unique cultural identities, protect their natural environments, and ensure that economic gains from tourism benefit all stakeholders equitably.
1297;Many cities have areas where the only cars are taxis and buses.Is this a positive or a negative development? What are the effects of this on individuals and society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Banning cars from the centre of various cities around the world has been a strategy to reduce pollution and encourage people to use public transport. It has had various positive effects for both individuals and for society as a whole.Banning cars from the centre of cities seems to be a very positive development. Fewer cars on the road means less pollution and fewer fossil fuel resources being used up. Although the effect on resources might be relatively negligible, it can create a newer way of thinking regarding the dynamics of transport within cities and this could be the most important benefit to society. Some people working in the centre of these cities may complain about inconvenience, but many would agree that this is a small price to pay.A reduction in the reliance of people on private vehicles is likely to encourage them to use public transport or even bicycles. Using public transport, especially the types that run on clean sources of power, will significantly raise air quality levels in cities, which will of course benefit everyone. The clean air could even further encourage the use of bicycles, which would in turn promote more healthy lifestyles and less obesity. This would contribute on an individual level to people’s well-being and a better and longer life, and on a societal level, it would lessen the strain on public health resources. Governments could encourage this by creating more bicycle lanes to make cycling easier and safer.In conclusion, it is clear that banning cars from the centre of cities is significantly beneficial. Better health and ecology, as well as improvement in longevity and well-being can benefit individuals and the entire society.;The movement to limit vehicle access in designated urban areas, permitting only taxis and buses, represents a promising advancement. This initiative seeks to alleviate traffic congestion, decrease air pollution, and foster a more sustainable cityscape. By curtailing the presence of private cars in these zones, streets become less congested, which not only reduces the risk of accidents but also shortens travel times for public transport and taxis.This shift brings a host of advantages for both individuals and society at large. For individuals, enhanced air quality and diminished noise pollution lead to healthier living and working conditions. Additionally, the greater efficiency of public transport and taxi services facilitates smoother, more dependable commutes, boosting productivity and overall quality of life. Cities like Copenhagen illustrate the success of such policies, yielding cleaner, safer, and more livable urban environments.From a societal perspective, this initiative helps curb greenhouse gas emissions, a vital component of the global strategy to address climate change. It also encourages a shift toward more sustainable transportation options, such as cycling and walking, by making urban areas more amenable to pedestrians. This transformation can promote a healthier, more active populace and lessen the strain on healthcare systems. Furthermore, prioritizing public and shared transit fosters a sense of community and social unity among residents.Nonetheless, it is crucial to implement these policies with consideration for all community members, including those who depend on private vehicles due to mobility challenges or other special needs. Thoughtful planning and the provision of alternative, accessible transportation options are essential for ensuring the benefits of this development are felt by everyone.In summary, restricting private vehicle access in specific city zones to allow only taxis and buses is a progressive approach to urban development. This strategy provides numerous benefits, ranging from environmental and health improvements to enhanced quality of life and community engagement. With careful implementation, this initiative can significantly help to create more sustainable, equitable, and vibrant cities.
1332;Many countries are experiencing population growth and need to build more homes. Some say that new homes should be constructed in existing cities while others argue that new towns should be built to accommodate the growing population. What are the advantages and disadvantages of these points of view?;In the past two decades, there has been an exponential increase in the migration of people to different cities and countries, indirectly resulting in a considerable infrastructure development. However, there has been a long-standing debate on whether to direct these infrastructure projects to current cities or establish new counties. Careful consideration of both alternatives reveals that each has its positives and negatives.One of the major advantages of focusing on current cities for new construction is that it would benefit the residents of the cities in multiple ways. Tenants living in Vancouver would prefer to buy a newly constructed house in the city where they work rather than in a new town, to reduce their commute time. Moreover, the city has everything they desire such as efficient public transport, thriving job market and affordable healthcare. This would not be possible in new towns because of the time it takes to establish services and generate opportunities for people.On the other hand, accommodating people in houses built in newly created towns would put them in a pollution-free and clean environment. This is because new towns may take at least 10 years of time to become an attractive spot for people and industries alike. As a result, their exposure to harmful emissions from industrial plants and transportation is reduced, shielding them from the risks of acquiring health complications. A recent report released by the word Health Organization (WHO) suggests that the number of people affected by airborne infections is 20% higher in cities compared to new towns that were formed just a couple of years ago.In conclusion, while there are both positive and negative aspects to these views, the decision on where to build the new homes to accommodate increasing population will depend on many other factors as well. Therefore, a thorough assessment is required before starting an infrastructure project.;Addressing the challenge of accommodating an expanding population is a significant concern for many nations. Two predominant viewpoints have emerged: one supports the construction of new homes in current urban areas, while the other advocates for the establishment of new towns. Each option has its own set of benefits and drawbacks.Building new residences within existing cities presents several advantages. It allows for a more efficient utilization of current infrastructure, including transportation networks, educational institutions, and healthcare services. Additionally, it gives residents access to well-established amenities such as shops, restaurants, and recreational facilities. However, this strategy can also result in increased congestion, pressure on existing resources, and a rise in living costs.Conversely, developing new towns provides a fresh opportunity for urban planning and design. These new developments can incorporate green technologies and sustainable infrastructure, enhancing the quality of life for their residents. Furthermore, they can be tailored to address the specific demands of a growing population, with sufficient housing, community resources, and job opportunities. Nonetheless, the process of creating new towns can be expensive and require significant time and investment in infrastructure and services.Ultimately, a blended approach that integrates aspects of both perspectives may offer the most effective solution. By building new homes in urban areas while also developing new towns, nations can better accommodate their increasing populations and mitigate the disadvantages associated with each option. This hybrid strategy can help distribute populations more evenly, alleviate pressure on established cities, and provide residents with diverse housing options and amenities. By weighing the pros and cons of each stance, policymakers can make informed choices to foster thriving and sustainable communities for their growing populations.
1327;Many people argue that museums and art galleries should present the nation’s art, as opposed to artworks from other countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The cultural value of engaging with museums and art galleries is unquestionable; they exert a great deal of influence on our perception of the world. It is only reasonable to ponder whether or not these outlets of culture should concentrate their efforts on presenting the nation’s own art, and not that of other countries. In my opinion, there should be an attempt to strike a balance and put the objects of national art in the spotlight, while allowing the public to get acquainted with foreign artworks to a certain extent.If people were to only find sculptures and paintings by national artists in their local museums, that would have a number of positive effects, such as the fame the artists of that country would gain and the pride its citizens would feel for their fellow countrymen. It would promote patriotism and strengthen the image of the country in the eyes of its inhabitants. Local artists would also receive more financial assistance from the government as their works would generate a significant amount of interest, potentially resulting in further development of the local art. However, in order to evolve art needs fresh ideas, and without exposure to a wider range of creativity the world provides, the evolution of local arts may be hindered.People enjoy art because it appeals to their inner sense of beauty and triggers strong emotions, and whether the masterpiece that causes these feelings belongs to a local or foreign artist is irrelevant. Talent knows no geographical boundaries; therefore, the emphasis should be on how much joy or amazement the work of art brings, rather than on its origin. If that principle were to be followed, we would never have to choose between local and international art. Reducing our museums or galleries’ collections to local art works, in my view, would be harmful and go against the democratic nature of art.To sum up, it seems to me that a country has nothing to lose by allowing its people to admire art created elsewhere in the world. A conscious choice by the government to support local artists while hosting exhibitions from other countries could prove the most beneficial.";The discussion about the focus of museums and art galleries has ignited a vigorous debate, with some advocating for these institutions to emphasize the art of their own nation over international works. While I see the reasoning behind this perspective, I only partially agree with it.On one side, highlighting a nation's art can nurture a sense of national identity and cultural pride. By featuring local artists and their creations, museums allow citizens to engage with their cultural heritage and appreciate the unique insights and talents of their fellow countrymen. Additionally, this focus can provide crucial opportunities for emerging local artists to gain visibility and recognition. For example, a museum that centers on national artists can play a pivotal role in promoting and preserving the nation's cultural legacy.Conversely, I believe it is equally important for museums and art galleries to showcase artworks from abroad. This inclusive approach can foster cross-cultural understanding, education, and appreciation. By presenting a varied collection of international art, visitors gain valuable insights into different cultures, historical contexts, and artistic movements. This exposure can expand their horizons, challenge preconceived notions, and deepen their comprehension of the world. Moreover, it encourages global cooperation, cultural exchange, and mutual respect.In conclusion, while I recognize the significance of highlighting a nation’s art, I contend that museums and art galleries should balance local and international exhibits. This equilibrium can enhance national pride, promote cultural diversity, and facilitate global understanding, ultimately enriching visitor experiences and contributing to a more informed and empathetic society.
955;Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?;Numerous experts think that every country should be capable to produce more materials and commodities. I agree with this argument as it brings benefits to countries and I will highlight some of them.To begin with, manufacturing goods is essential to any country as it helps to build their economy. Increasing production power assist them to export more and it also makes them less dependent on other countries. For instance, China is one of the largest producers in the world in any goods which also makes them the largest exporter. Such development in production power contributes to their gross domestic product.Another reason is that extra produced goods can be used in emergencies, such emergencies are pandemics, financial crises and many more. By growing the production of goods and materials, a country will always be a reliable business partner. Thus, companies will reach out to them and become loyal partners. Moreover, countries should be aware that by increasing their production. For example, there is a semiconductor chip crisis is going on all over the world and no country in the world is able to meet the demands of chips. On the contrary, India is now planning to satisfy the demand for chips by strengthening its manufacturing capacity to a massive level while it will directly contribute to their economy and also generate job opportunities.To conclude, I agree that more in-house production is necessary. It is extremely crucial to produce more needed products in order to consistently outperform the rest of the world and also it brings many beneficial things like generating job opportunities and a rise in the Gross domestic product of a country.;The idea that every nation should prioritize continuous production growth has been a widely held belief for a long time. However, I have reservations about this perspective. While increasing the output of goods and materials can indeed stimulate economic growth, create jobs, and enhance living standards, there are important drawbacks to take into account.On one hand, boosting production can yield various advantages, such as fostering innovation, lowering prices, and broadening access to goods and services. These outcomes can contribute to elevated living standards and improved quality of life. For example, countries like Japan and South Korea have achieved significant economic progress and development through vigorous industrialization and heightened production efforts.Conversely, an unwavering focus on production can lead to serious environmental harm and the depletion of natural resources. The relentless quest for growth often results in overconsumption, pollution, and waste, jeopardizing the earth's ecological integrity. Additionally, the constant push for higher production can create social issues, including worker exploitation and growing income inequality.In summary, while enhancing production can contribute positively to economic growth and development, it shouldn't be the only goal for any country. A more balanced strategy that takes into account economic, social, and environmental considerations is essential. Governments and policymakers should aim for sustainable development that values the well-being of both citizens and the planet, rather than fixating solely on continual production growth. By embracing a more comprehensive approach, nations can secure long-term prosperity and environmental health, avoiding a singular pursuit that may ultimately harm both their citizens and the world.
1367;Many people believe that reducing speed limits is the best option for road safety improvement (agree/disagree);"Many people believe that reducing speed limits is the best option for road safety improvement. Do you think there are other measures that could be put in place? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?One of the most conspicuous trends of today’s world is a colossal surge in the number of vehicle accidents cars, trucks and buses, all over the , be it in impoverished or developed nations. There is a wide range of factors that . In my opinion, this situation could be remedied, provided some effective measures are taken.Measures to deal with this soaring concern are many; the most significant are not remote or complicated but accessible and practicable. The primary one lies in the fact that governments should take a firm stance and apply stringent rules and regulations to lower the speed limit. Secondly, using electronic devices while driving should be forbidden by law. Finally, an awareness program could be initiated by individuals to educate the public about the catastrophic effects of unsafe roads and the projected enhancements for road safety. Only when convergent efforts from all sectors are ensured, can we expect to see considerable progress in tackling this problem.There is a deluge of merits for implementation of reduced speed limits. High speed is likely to impose life threatening danger on people crossing the roads, due to the perilous nature of this hazardous speed with danger being an integral part of it. Not only does reducing the speed limits contribute to decreasing daily accidents, but it also raises the standard of driving. Needless to say, all these advantages have a far-reaching impact on pedestrian safety.There are, however, some pitfalls that can easily overpower the potential benefits of limiting speed. The primary one stems from the fact that slowing the speed could lead to augmenting the daily traffic hours. Besides, it could also delay delivering sick and patients to hospitals. Hence, it is apparent why some individuals are against changing the standardized level of speed.From what has been discussed, one can conclude that despite the drawbacks of reducing speed limits, the expected benefits of this measure are indeed far greater.All the parts of the task have been covered fairly well. The response presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt with suitable, widely covered and thoroughly supported ideas. The range of vocabulary is adequate for the requirements of task response. There are some mistakes in word choice and grammar. Nevertheless, the essay is up to the mark and is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.";I believe that lowering speed limits is a practical approach to enhancing road safety. Excessive speeding is a major contributor to accidents, often resulting in loss of vehicle control and longer stopping distances. By implementing reduced speed limits, drivers are compelled to slow down, which subsequently decreases the likelihood of accidents. This is especially critical in high-traffic areas, like school zones and residential neighborhoods, where the potential for injury or fatalities is notably higher.Furthermore, lower speed limits can diminish the severity of accidents when they occur. Collisions at reduced speeds are generally less impactful, leading to fewer fatalities and less serious injuries. Numerous studies substantiate this, illustrating a clear link between speed and the severity of accidents. For example, the World Health Organization has found that a 1% reduction in speed corresponds to a 2% decrease in accidents.In addition to improving safety, lowering speed limits can also help alleviate traffic congestion and noise pollution. Slower driving tends to encourage smoother driving patterns and safer following distances, which can promote a more organized flow of traffic. This can reduce the frustration and stress that often accompany driving, enriching the overall experience for all road users.However, it’s essential to acknowledge that merely lowering speed limits will not solve all road safety challenges. Factors such as driver education, effective road design, and proper vehicle maintenance are also crucial for enhancing road safety. Nonetheless, implementing lower speed limits is a significant step towards making roads safer. When integrated with other safety initiatives, this strategy can notably decrease accidents and fatalities. Therefore, reducing speed limits represents a valuable method for improving road safety.
1290;Many people believe that studying at university is the best way to develop oneself, learn new skills and find a well-paid job. Other people believe that more is learned from getting a job straight away after school and learning whilst working.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;There are many ways to learn new knowledge and skills. Traditional educational routes, such as school followed by college or university is one route that is generally accepted and respected by today’s society. It can be argued, however, that this is not always the best way. A more vocational route can be more appropriate for certain people and for particular jobs.Universities generally have deference given to them and, due to this, most schools tailor their programs to help students get university admission. Universities usually have respected and highly qualified teachers who have the knowledge and the skills to take their students to very high levels of knowledge and expertise. The very difficulty of gaining admission, getting through the duration of the course and passing final exams ensures to employers that graduates have the necessary self-discipline, intelligence and ability to get through the courses.Universities are also particularly well suited to the teaching of various subjects, for example, medicine, law and literature and these subjects need students’ full-time attention in order to do well. Although vocational experience is necessary, a certain grounding in basic concepts to a high-level is important. Once this knowledge has been acquired, students can then integrate their knowledge with practical understanding.This, however, is not the case for all areas of learning, especially ones where the quantity of high level knowledge is not required or is possible to be learned whilst working at the same time. Young people studying to be an electrician or a plumber are good examples. To do this work well requires a lot of experience, yet also a sound understanding of theory. The learning here can be and is done working and studying at the same time, often through apprenticeships and vocational courses involving significant amounts of work experience.Therefore, in my opinion, there are more ways than one to acquire a profession. Whether learning should take place at university alone or whilst working depends on the course and the end job.;The ongoing debate about the most effective route to development, education, and obtaining a high-paying job has generated considerable discussion. On one side, many advocate that attending university is the best way to reach these objectives. A university education fosters critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and communication skills, all highly sought after by employers. Additionally, university programs provide specialized knowledge and training in specific disciplines, improving career prospects for graduates. For example, professions like law, medicine, and engineering generally require a university degree. The structured environment of a university, along with access to resources such as libraries and laboratories, further enhances both academic and personal development.Conversely, some contend that entering the workforce immediately after high school and acquiring skills through on-the-job training may be more advantageous. This approach enables individuals to gain practical experience, develop specific skills relevant to their jobs, and earn a salary while they learn. Apprenticeships and vocational training exemplify this model, allowing people to acquire trades or skills while working. This path can be particularly beneficial in fields where practical experience holds greater value than theoretical knowledge, such as construction, culinary arts, or IT.In my view, an ideal strategy combines both approaches. While university education establishes a robust foundation, integrating it with practical, work-related learning can enhance personal and professional growth. Many universities now incorporate internships, co-op programs, and project-based learning into their curricula, effectively linking academic learning with real-world experience. This combination of theoretical knowledge and practical application equips individuals more thoroughly for their careers. Moreover, in the rapidly changing job market of today, the ability to learn continuously and adapt is essential—a skill that can be developed through a mix of education and work experience.In summary, although both pathways have their advantages, I believe that a blend of university education and practical on-the-job training presents the most comprehensive approach to personal development, skill acquisition, and securing a lucrative job. This balanced method not only provides individuals with theoretical knowledge but also equips them with the practical skills and flexibility necessary to excel in their chosen careers.
1288;Many people in cities today live in high-rise apartment blocks. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this type of living?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;High-rise apartment blocks are a common sight in cities around the world. They are especially popular in large cities and in locations where building land is scarce. Living in such buildings has various advantages and disadvantages for town planners and the inhabitants themselves.The most significant advantage of high-rise apartment blocks is probably for the town planners. With land often being at a premium in large cities, one way to maximise space is to build upwards, so that the population density per square kilometre can be increased. The demand for housing in big cities can therefore be more easily met. There are also disadvantages for town planners. The heavier population density can put added pressure on social facilities, for example sewage and other waste disposal, and the provision of adequate school and medical services.There are also advantages and disadvantages for the actual inhabitants of high-rise apartment blocks. With the demand for housing being reduced, prices are therefore not as high, making housing more affordable. Many people also like not having to be responsible for a garden, and living in an apartment has this advantage. Finally, with so many people living in the same area, many friendships can be made and a community spirit can be built up. It appears the most significant disadvantage is that, in practice, living in high-rise apartment blocks is just not the lifestyle many people want. In some city neighbourhoods, these living spaces can often be associated with poor living conditions and undesirable social elements. In addition, many people view high-rise apartment blocks as being unsafe. For example, in the case of fire, tall buildings are difficult or impossible to evacuate safely.It is clear that high-rise apartment blocks have benefits and drawbacks. It is also clear, however, that due to the need to house increasing numbers of people in cities, these architectural features are here to stay, whether people like them or not.;The rise of high-rise apartment buildings in urban settings has become a defining characteristic of contemporary city living. This lifestyle offers numerous benefits but also presents several challenges. On the positive side, high-rise apartment living maximizes land use, which is crucial in densely populated areas where space is limited. By constructing upward, cities can accommodate more residents within a smaller footprint, thereby alleviating urban sprawl and helping to protect green spaces. Moreover, many high-rise developments come equipped with modern amenities—such as pools, fitness centers, and communal areas—that significantly enrich residents' quality of life.Additionally, high-rise living generally includes improved security features, such as CCTV and controlled access, contributing to a safer environment. For example, in cities like Singapore, high-rise living is prevalent, with residents often highlighting community and security as key advantages. The elevated floors of these buildings often afford breathtaking panoramic views of the city, adding to the appeal.Conversely, there are notable disadvantages to residing in high-rise apartments. A major downside is the potential for diminished privacy and increased noise levels from adjacent units. The close living quarters can create disturbances and a feeling of overcrowding, which may be uncomfortable for some individuals. Another key issue is the dependence on elevators and other mechanical systems, which can fail and leave residents inconvenienced or stranded—especially during power outages, when those on higher floors might struggle to return to their homes.In summary, while high-rise apartment living offers advantages like effective land utilization and improved security, it also introduces challenges such as reduced privacy and reliance on mechanical systems. Ultimately, the choice to live in a high-rise should align with an individual’s personal priorities and lifestyle, carefully weighing the pros and cons to reach a well-informed decision.
789;Many people now undertake extreme activities, from hang-gliding to mountain climbing.Why do people risk their lives in this way, and do you think this is a good trend?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Extreme sports, such as mountain climbing and hand-gliding, have become increasingly popular over the past several decades. Now more than ever, athletes can be paid to do these activities full-time, encouraging more aspiring athletes to enter extreme sports. In addition, the addictive nature of these activities means that participants tend to stay in the sport for the thrill. While the increased popularity can result in more accidents, it can also make the sports safer as atheletes collectively learn from past mistakes.While people have undertaken extreme activities long before the advent of television and social media, these new platforms give extreme sports the much needed sponsorship and attention. Nowadays, outlandish and dangerous acts can be televised and monetized, giving the athletes a way to make a living out of these events. Therefore, more people would feel encouraged to participate in these activities knowing that they can have a decent income. On top of the external motivation, most extreme athletes take part in these sports because they are thrilling and addicting. These atheletes chase the rush and validation that they get when doing dangerous activities. As a result, even without the external rewards, some people would still partake in these sports.Given that people are motivated both internally and externally to participate in extreme sports, it is inevitable that these activities become more popular. While it is true that increased participation would result in more accidents, it would also create more lessons for future participants. In this way, these accidents and injuries would help educate future athletes on how to protect themselves. Moreoever, this increased popularity would also encourage governments to draft more safety regulations.In conclusion, given that it is human nature to want to achieve feats of strength and courage, extreme sports would always be attractive for some. Because of this, there will always be people injuring themselves while pursuing these feats. Therefore, these activities would become safer the more athletes learn from past incidents.;In recent years, the popularity of extreme activities has surged dramatically. Many people are now participating in high-risk adventures like hang-gliding, bungee jumping, and mountain climbing. But what drives individuals to willingly put themselves in such perilous situations? I believe this phenomenon stems from a natural human craving for adrenaline and a desire for personal challenges.One significant motivator for engaging in extreme activities is the exhilarating thrill and sense of achievement that comes from confronting fears and stretching one’s physical capabilities. For example, mountain climbers often experience immense pride and fulfillment upon reaching a peak, which inspires them to pursue even more ambitious endeavors. Furthermore, the adrenaline associated with extreme sports can become addictive, prompting individuals to seek ever-more intense experiences.While some critics may label this trend as reckless and irresponsible, I contend that it can yield positive outcomes when approached with caution and proper training. Extreme activities can cultivate a sense of community and camaraderie among participants and enhance both mental and physical well-being. For instance, rock climbing can boost strength, flexibility, and problem-solving abilities while imparting important lessons about perseverance and risk management.Nevertheless, it’s crucial to recognize the inherent risks and take appropriate precautions to minimize dangers. With the right equipment, expert guidance, and safety measures, the hazards associated with extreme activities can be substantially reduced. Ultimately, I believe this trend can be advantageous when undertaken responsibly, offering individuals the opportunity to challenge themselves, build self-confidence, and savor the excitement of adventure. By approaching this trend with care and respect, we can harness its potential to encourage personal growth and well-being.
1345;Many people support animal testing while others believe it isn’t appropriate (discuss);Many people support use of animals for testing medicines for humans. Others believe it isn’t appropriate to use animals for such experiments. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayApproval of the medicines for human use is a tedious process which involves a series of tests often performed on animals. While some people support this idea because it makes drugs safer for human consumption, others believe that it is an unethical practice. Personally, I am in favour of the idea that medicines should be tested in all possible scenarios before being released to the public.Those against animal experimentation argue that animals have the same rights as human beings because they are the outcome of the same evolution process through which humans came into existence. Infecting them with viruses and exposing them to bacteria, to create a conducive environment to test a chemical substance may cause excruciating pain to these lab animals. Any failed test can mean that the subject either loses its precious life or suffers for the rest of its existence, and understandably, some people are against what they consider an immoral practice.Nonetheless, if a drug is released into the market without a thorough end-to-end testing, it could cause severe damage to anyone who may consume it. Every day a large number of animals are being mercilessly killed by humans for their mere flesh and skin. There isn’t a big difference between killing an animal for food and sacrificing its life for testing a chemical composition, because both actions are helping the human race to survive. What’s more, the life of one animal used to test a life-saving drug could help many people live. This is why a large number of people believe that testing drugs on animals is a matter of survival.To sum up, there are valid reasons why animal testing seems cruel and unacceptable to some, and crucial to others. In my opinion, even though animals subjected to testing may suffer, it is a necessary step to ensure the healing power of a drug.;The controversy surrounding animal testing has ignited passionate discussions among people with varying viewpoints. Supporters of animal testing highlight its critical role in propelling medical research and safeguarding the safety of new drugs and products. They assert that animal testing is essential for developing life-saving treatments and cures for diseases, referencing the polio vaccine's success, which relied on animal research and has saved innumerable lives. Furthermore, they argue that such testing enables scientists to evaluate the effectiveness and potential side effects of new therapies in a controlled setting, thereby minimizing risks to human subjects.Conversely, many opponents argue against animal testing, raising issues related to animal welfare and the ethics of conducting experiments on living beings. They contend that animals are sentient creatures capable of experiencing pain, suffering, and emotional distress, making it morally inappropriate to use them in research. Additionally, as technology progresses, alternative approaches like in vitro testing and computer modeling are becoming increasingly viable, reducing our dependency on animal testing. Furthermore, some animal experiments have proven to be inconsistent and fail to accurately predict human reactions, calling into question their reliability in medical research.In summary, while some advocate for animal testing due to its potential benefits in advancing medicine, others challenge its appropriateness based on ethical and welfare concerns. As technological advancements continue, it's likely that alternative methods will gain traction, further decreasing the reliance on animal testing. Ultimately, a balanced perspective that weighs both the advantages and disadvantages of animal testing is essential for conducting medical research in a responsible and ethical way.
327;Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. Do you agree or disagree?;It is undeniable that nowadays, smart devices such as phones and tablets play an essential role in one's life. Through countless websites and applications, people can connect with each other without any boundaries. While many people agree that the introduction of these technologies has many disadvantages to the conservative way of starting and maintaining relationships, I personally believe that they rather develop new socializing methods.First and foremost, social medias and applications can help with keeping in touch with acquintances. Previously, people had to follow a precise time and location to meet up with their friends as they are unable to contact the others to reschedule. However, the internet allows them to update their plans at any time. This means that if there is any emergency, an individual can immediately postpone the upcoming event and find the next available slot to continue the plan. Furthermore, there are several applications that allow people to video call their friends and family who are currently living apart.The current technologies not only offer us options to communicate with our current contacts but also allow us to discover new friends. In the past, it is difficult to find people with a common interest which had to be done through social events. Nowadays, online communities enable their users to connect with new friends virtually. Thus, fewer individuals are left alone, especially introverts and those who are living in remote areas which can have difficulties socializing offline.All in all, despite the fact that there are many positive impacts of the invention of social medias and communication technologies, there are also risks and downsides of using them without face-to-face communication. Therefore, the time used for socializing online and offline should always be balanced.;The rise of modern communication technology has fundamentally changed how individuals connect with one another. While it has certainly made interactions quicker and more convenient, many contend that it negatively impacts social relationships. I share this perspective.On one side, technologies like social media and messaging apps have facilitated connections across vast distances. However, this shift has also resulted in a reduction of face-to-face interactions, which are vital for fostering and sustaining meaningful bonds. Many individuals now find themselves spending hours scrolling through social media rather than engaging in direct conversations with family and friends.Additionally, modern communication tools can create an illusion of connection. While someone may boast hundreds of online acquaintances, they may still lack profound, authentic relationships. This phenomenon can contribute to feelings of loneliness and isolation, even amid a bustling online community. Moreover, the endless flow of information on social media can establish unrealistic standards and encourage materialism, which may lead to a sense of dissatisfaction and disconnection from others.In summary, despite the numerous advantages of modern communication technology, I believe it adversely affects social relationships. The reduction in face-to-face interactions, the illusion of connection, and the fostering of unrealistic expectations are all serious concerns. To nurture healthy relationships, it is crucial to find a balance between using technology and engaging in personal interactions. By recognizing these potential downsides, we can utilize modern communication tools in a manner that enhances, rather than detracts from, our social connections.
837;Many people today, especially in the developed world, are choosing to have fewer children, or none at all.Why is this happening, and do you think it is a good trend?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Weather to have children or not is one of the most important questions young adults have to ask themselfs nowadays. Overpopulation is one of the many global problems next to climate change, and poverty.In my opinion, the need to have children roots back to us being nothing more, but civilised animals. Animals have one goal above all; reproduce. This is why in many cultures, men and women who cannot have chlidren are seen as disabled, or sick. Nowadays, modern values changed our perspective, having children is often seen as a necessity for a happy, and successful life.It is important to recognise the problems the developed world faces. There is smoke in the air, plastic pollution everywhere, poverty in third world countries, and many other factors that make Earth a terrible place for many. Above all, the life we give birth to will have to eat, drink, and consume just like everyone else, using more and more of the already limited resources, generating more and more trash.Many people argue that the above mentioned points are a pessimistic and unrealistic. Humans have to reproduce, to keep the species from extintion. And truthfully the only way to do that, is to give birth as many kids as possible. This issue lies deep in our society; here in Hungary, a family is rewared almost 30000 USD if they have 3 or more kids. This means that many people have children because they get money for it, and they are also seen socially accepted.I believe modern day intelligence goes further than IQ points and money earned. We have to recognise the problems created, overpopulation being one of them. While I do not believe that we should not have kids, I think there should be careful planning involved and self-reflection before giving birth to new life.";The trend of having fewer or no children is increasingly common in developed nations. A significant factor driving this change is the rising cost of living, which includes the financial pressures of raising children. In many regions, expenses associated with education, healthcare, and childcare are considerable, making it difficult for parents to manage their finances. Consequently, many people are choosing to limit the number of children they have or to remain childless to ensure their economic stability.Another key element influencing this trend is the evolution of societal values and priorities. With progress in women's rights and gender equality, numerous women are focusing on their careers and personal ambitions, often prioritizing these goals over starting a family. Furthermore, the greater availability of contraceptive methods and family planning options has empowered individuals to make well-informed decisions regarding their reproductive health.Although some may perceive this trend negatively, I see it as having several advantages. For example, fewer children can enhance the quality of life for both parents and their offspring. Parents can invest more time, resources, and attention in each child, fostering a more stable and supportive environment. Additionally, countries with declining birth rates, such as Japan and Italy, are increasingly investing in education and childcare, leading to a more skilled and knowledgeable workforce.In summary, the trend of having fewer or no children is a multifaceted issue influenced by various factors. While it presents challenges, such as potential concerns about population decline and aging demographics, it also offers benefits. Ultimately, the choice to have children is deeply personal, and individuals should feel empowered to make informed decisions about their reproductive health and family planning.
1317;Many people try to achieve a work-life balance but fail. Why is this happening? What can be done to help people overcome this problem?;Many people strive to achieve a work-life balance, but often find themselves failing despite their best efforts. This is not surprising, as balancing work and life commitments can be extremely difficult due to both having their unique stressors.One of the major reasons why so many people struggle to achieve harmony between their personal and professional lives is that now it is easier than ever for people to stay connected outside of regular work hours. This has led to an expectation that employees should always be available, and they risk being seen as unreliable or uncommitted if they are not. A knock-on effect of longer working hours is that little time is left for leisure activities such as socialising or engaging in hobbies or sports, which help reduce stress levels and improve overall well-being. This type of pressure and lack of free time can lead to feelings of burnout, with no respite from life’s pressures, resulting in chronic fatigue and diminished motivation over time.Helping those struggling to find a suitable work-life balance will require joint efforts of managers and employees. Workers, for instance, need to recognise the importance of taking regular breaks throughout the day and getting enough sleep each night, while employers should consider being more flexible when it comes to allowing staff to work remotely and offering paid vacation days. This will give employees space, both mentally and physically, enabling them to better manage their commitments without overextending themselves.In conclusion, achieving a successful work-life balance is something that many cannot quite reach due to external pressures from employers and a lack of downtime. However, these issues can be overcome, if we create realistic boundaries between our professional lives and personal goals, and make conscious decisions about how we want to spend our time.;"In today's fast-paced society, the idea of work-life balance has emerged as a critical issue for many. While many strive to find harmony between their professional and personal lives, achieving this balance often proves challenging. A major contributor to this struggle is the escalating demands of the workplace. Advances in technology have led employers to expect workers to be accessible around the clock, blurring the lines between work and home life.Additionally, a lack of effective time management skills plays a significant role in making it difficult to maintain this balance. Individuals often struggle to prioritize their tasks effectively, which can result in an overwhelming focus on work at the expense of personal obligations. The societal pressure to consistently perform and excel further exacerbates this issue, pushing individuals to prioritize their careers over their overall well-being.To address this challenge, there are several strategies individuals can implement. First, setting clear boundaries between work and personal life—such as defining specific work hours and refraining from work-related tasks during personal time—can be beneficial. Developing time management skills, including the ability to prioritize tasks and to say ""no"" to unnecessary commitments, can also help create more space for personal activities. Employers can contribute positively by fostering flexible work options; allowing for varied hours and remote work can enable employees to better balance their professional and personal responsibilities.Ultimately, achieving work-life balance demands intentional efforts from both individuals and employers. By acknowledging the significance of personal well-being and actively prioritizing it, individuals can navigate the challenges of maintaining a healthy work-life balance, paving the way for a more satisfying and sustainable lifestyle."
1298;Many schoolchildren today take part in work experience sessions for short periods of time instead of attending school. Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It has been a popular trend for some time now to put children into what can be called ‘work experience placements’. The children are taken out of school and take part in various types of work, usually for around a week. Some people criticise this trend, but I can’t see how it can be a negative experience.One of the criticisms is that children lose a week of schoolwork. With the pressure to do well at school increasing, children need every bit of help to maximise their potential. Taking them out of the school, it is therefore argued, stops them from getting access to needed education for a whole week. As the students won’t really be of much help to a workplace for just one week, it would therefore be better for them to remain at school.While this is a valid point, taking a child’s entire experience of school into account, a single week away does not make a significant difference. Indeed, if the timing of the week’s work placements is done correctly, the week can also serve as a kind of ‘holiday’ away from school, something that is regularly needed in order to allow students to remain fresh and enthusiastic. In many work placements, children also get to see some of things they learn at school put into a realistic context, allowing them to understand the relevance of what they learn and thereby creating a way to reinforce the learning.In addition to this, schoolchildren can be quite nervous about the world of work that they will have to join at some point in their lives. By getting this short taste of what it is like, they can see that it is nothing to be scared about. As well as this, children will often have some ideas of what they want to do for a living, but are not sure. By allowing them to see a type of work they are considering, they are better able to decide whether that career could be suitable for them.I feel, therefore, that work placements can be seen as a positive development. Missing a short amount of school is not serious and the benefits that can be gained from the placements are significant.;The increasing trend of schoolchildren engaging in work experience sessions rather than attending traditional classes has ignited a discussion about its effects. In my view, this shift is predominantly advantageous. One significant benefit of work experience is that it equips students with practical skills and firsthand exposure to actual work environments. This can be especially advantageous for those who are uncertain about their future career options, as it enables them to explore various fields and gain valuable insights.Additionally, participating in work experience helps students cultivate vital life skills, including communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. Working in a professional atmosphere teaches students to take responsibility, manage their time efficiently, and function under pressure. For example, a student in a work experience program at a hospital might acquire knowledge in patient care, medical terminology, and hospital administration, which can be crucial for determining if a healthcare career aligns with their interests.Furthermore, work experience can boost a student's employability after they graduate. Many employers regard practical experience as an important asset, which can provide students with a competitive advantage in the job market. Additionally, these sessions can help students build a network of professional contacts that could be beneficial for future job prospects or recommendations.On the other hand, critics may contend that engaging in work experience detracts from academic time, potentially affecting student grades or comprehension of essential concepts. Nevertheless, if organized effectively, work experience can complement academic learning and provide a more enriched educational experience. In summary, integrating work experience sessions into a student’s curriculum represents a positive development, offering a wealth of benefits that can influence their future careers and personal growth. By fostering practical skills, real-life experiences, and enhanced employability, work experience presents an invaluable opportunity that can pave the way for student success.

This essay will describe in detail why English is an important international language.Firstly, the English language is widely used in many countries and at present, the world traders are currently developing rapidly. In order to compete with people from different countries, it is to be able to communicate the English language. For example, China has been improving a lot in many sectors. They are able to compete with other countries because many people in China English language and they are trying hard to study English.Secondly, many companies prefer to employ people who can speak English because if the companies create new in different countries, the employers are able to move the new branch without new people and the branch company is still able to communicate with the central company. In fact, one of the largest companies in the world (Google) has created some in different countries and each of the Google is able to discuss things or otherwise communicate even though they are in different countries because they all use English to communicate.In conclusion, many people move to English speaking countries for further studies because they believe that it will improve their English skills and in order to become a successful person in the future, mastering English is .;The appeal of English-speaking nations has transformed into a beacon for millions of students globally, attracting them to prestigious universities in Australia, the UK, and the US. The primary driver of this significant movement is the recognition and opportunities that come with education in English. As the global lingua franca, English facilitates connections among individuals from various backgrounds and cultures.A key aspect of English's significance lies in its prevalent use in business, science, and technology. Leading multinational companies, research organizations, and scientific communities predominantly operate in English, making it an indispensable asset for professional growth. Learning in English equips students with crucial language skills that enhance their competitiveness and enable effective interaction with international peers.Moreover, the internet and digital platforms have solidified English's status, with a large portion of online content and resources presented in English. This accessibility has generated an extensive repository of knowledge for students who master the language. Consequently, English serves as a gateway to a wealth of information, innovation, and collaboration.In summary, the surge of students heading to English-speaking countries can be traced to the language's unmatched significance in contemporary society. By studying in English, individuals can deepen their understanding of their fields, improve their career opportunities, and engage actively in the global exchange of ideas. As English continues to assert itself as the leading international language, its attraction is poised to persist, enticing scholars and professionals from across the globe to the prestigious institutions of English-speaking countries.
795;Missions to explore space are hugely expensive, and there are problems on Earth which demand attention. The number of these missions needs to be reduced.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is supposed by many, that high-cost space studies should be cut off while more focus should be paid to the challenges mankind face on Earth. This essay completely disargees with such view because of two reasons that will de developed further.The first reason is that only rich countries spend thier budgets for space studies. This means that only when states have resolved most of their problems with poverty, level of medicine treatment, safety, they can divert some of the funds to invest in future technologies. Moreover, citizens will go on a strike and make the govenment to deal with real life problems instead of dreaming about the space. For example, not more than 5% of USA GDP is spent on space programs that is sufficient to progress, construct new sputniks, and send astronauts to the Internations Space Station.The second argument supposes that many space technologies have a dual puropose. In other words, being initially developed for studing the space, they were adopted to make people's day-to-day life easier. For example, mobile phones and the mobile Internet, navigaion using GPS would not be possibe if people were not trying to explore space.In conclusion, new technologies are developed when people are trying to learn the world outside our planet. This;I disagree with the notion that we should reduce the number of space exploration missions. Although it's true that these missions can be expensive and there are urgent challenges on Earth that need addressing, the advantages of space exploration far surpass the associated costs. Research in space has resulted in numerous breakthroughs and innovations that enhance our everyday lives, such as GPS technology, memory foam, and advanced water purification systems.Additionally, space exploration holds significant promise in tackling some of the world's most critical issues, including climate change and resource scarcity. For instance, NASA's Earth Observing System has played a vital role in monitoring climate trends and providing invaluable data for scientists to analyze and devise strategies to combat climate change. Likewise, agencies like the European Space Agency are focused on creating sustainable technologies for resource management, including improved irrigation methods and drought monitoring systems.Cutting back on space missions would be a myopic approach that would stifle our capacity for new discoveries and innovative solutions to global challenges. Instead, governments and space agencies ought to prioritize and streamline their resources to ensure that space missions are executed efficiently and economically. This could include partnerships with private firms, resource sharing, and concentrating on missions that offer the most significant benefits to humanity. The collaboration between NASA and private companies like SpaceX, for example, has resulted in noteworthy cost reductions and advancements in space technology. In summary, while we face pressing issues on Earth that require our focus, the benefits derived from space exploration signify that it remains a crucial investment for the future of humanity.

1315;More and more people today are drinking sugar-based drinks. Why is this happening? What measures can be taken to reverse this trend?;An alarming number of people today consume sugar-based drinks, whether it is in the form of soda, energy drinks or fruit drinks. Often consumers are lured by their widespread availability and convenience, however, marketing campaigns also play a role, targeting young people and giving them the perception that sugary drinks are not as unhealthy as they actually are.The availability of these types of drinks has greatly increased over time. They can now be found in almost any store or restaurant, which makes them easily accessible to almost anyone. The fact that they are often cheaper than alternatives, such as water or freshly squeezed juice, makes them an especially attractive option for those on a budget. Marketing campaigns for sugary beverages have been quite successful in creating positive associations attached to these products through advertisements on TV and billboards. This encourages people to consider them fun rather than unhealthy and normalises them within society.Luckily, reversing the rise in popularity of sugary drinks is still possible, if we act now and attack the problem from different angles. One of the very first steps should be educating people on the health risks associated with high sugar intake so that they can make better-informed decisions when selecting what type of beverage they consume. Companies should also be held accountable by law for their misleading marketing campaigns aimed at children and teenagers who are more likely to believe the false claims about their products’ health benefits without fully understanding what’s being sold to them. Schools, colleges and universities, and any institutions catering for young people, should consider banning sugary drinks and replacing them with refreshing alternatives without added sugar.Overall, it is important that we recognise the potential health risks posed by consuming too much sugar from soft drinks and take actionable steps towards reversing this trend in order to ensure our long-term wellbeing. Through greater education, government regulation, and increased corporate responsibility we can ensure that more people understand why reducing their intake of sugary beverages is important while still allowing them to access enjoyable yet healthier options.;The rise in the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages has become a significant concern in recent years, as more and more people are incorporating these drinks into their daily routines. A major factor driving this trend is the easy accessibility and aggressive marketing of sugary drinks. They can be found readily in supermarkets, restaurants, and vending machines, making them a convenient choice for many. Additionally, the effective marketing tactics used by beverage companies, such as eye-catching packaging and appealing advertisements, have significantly increased their popularity, especially among young audiences.Another reason for the increasing consumption is the general lack of awareness regarding the harmful health effects linked to sugar-laden drinks. Many individuals do not realize the connection between these beverages and various health issues, such as obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay. Consequently, they continue to consume these drinks without fully understanding the potential health risks involved.To combat this trend, several strategies can be implemented. Firstly, governments and health organizations could initiate public education campaigns to inform people about the adverse health impacts of sugary drinks. Additionally, beverage manufacturers can be encouraged to lower the sugar content in their products and provide healthier options. Implementing taxes on sugary drinks may also help make them less appealing to consumers. Schools and workplaces can play a significant role by promoting healthy drinking habits and ensuring access to clean water and low-sugar alternatives. By taking these steps, we can work towards decreasing the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and fostering a healthier lifestyle. Ultimately, a collective effort from governments, organizations, and individuals is essential to shift towards a healthier drinking culture.
1259;More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Over the past decades, it has been registered a considerable decrease in the percentage of people eager to create a family at a young age. There could be different reasons for this and I am going to state them clearly in the following paragraphs, which will also explain why I believe the advantages of this situation far outweigh the disadvantages.Apparently, the society we currently live in has undergone substantial changes over the years, sometimes without us even noticing it. The most evident of these variations has probably been the gradual rise in the number of old people as opposed to the dramatic fall in the number of births. In fact, owing to the decline of the economy of most nations and the subsequent reduction of work opportunities, more and more people are giving up on the idea of becoming parents in their 20s or 30s. Many people see this as a negative aspect for our society; however, I have to strongly disagree with their opinion.The drawbacks to which a lot of people point out when discussing about these kind of topics often has to do with the age gap between parents and their children. Admittedly, someone cannot decide to have a child in their 40s without considering the significant generation gap that would separate them from their kids and, as a result, the issues of miscommunication that could arise.However, the disadvantages become of secondary importance as soon as the much more remarkable benefits are examined. First of all, older parents also means more responsible and mature caretakers; consequently, due to their broader life experience, they would arguably make better advisors for their kids. Not to mention that older parents would not only have more stable and secure jobs, but they would also have more consistent savings to devote to their children's further education, which in turn could help the latter having a better and well-paid job in the future.To conclude, although it's impossible not to take into account the drawbacks of having a child at a more advanced age, the advantages still outrun the disadvantages. Thus, children would be the first to benefit from such a situation.";In recent years, there has been a significant trend toward having children later in life. This shift can be attributed to various factors such as career ambitions, financial security, and greater personal maturity. Many individuals prefer to focus on building their careers and establishing a stable financial base before embracing the responsibilities of parenthood.One of the key benefits of waiting to have children is the enhanced financial stability that older parents can provide, creating a more secure and comfortable environment for their family. For example, a couple in their mid-30s is often in a better financial position, with improved job prospects that allow them to invest in their child's education and overall well-being. Additionally, older parents typically bring greater emotional maturity, which can foster more effective parenting and create a nurturing atmosphere.However, there are some drawbacks to consider as well. Older parents might find it challenging to keep up with the energy levels of their children and may face increased health risks associated with advanced maternal and paternal age. Despite these concerns, I believe that the benefits of having children at an older age tend to outweigh the disadvantages. Advances in medical technology and increasing life expectancy can help alleviate the risks related to older parenthood. Furthermore, the advantages of financial stability, emotional maturity, and life experience can greatly enrich a child's upbringing and development. Ultimately, the choice of when to start a family is a personal one, but for many, waiting until later in life can be a wise and fulfilling decision.
1425;Most high level positions in companies are filled by men, even though the workforce in many developed countries consists of 50 percent female workers. Companies should be required to allocate a certain percentage of management positions to women. Discuss, what is your opinion?;"The inequality between men and women has always been a significant issue in society. , it is undeniable that most vital positions in companies are taken by males, not females. Therefore, that companies should allocate to women a certain number of these positions. However, I do not agree with this requirement completely.In some feudal countries, it was true to say that the society the males, and at that time instances of inequality occurred very frequently. Up until the present moment, it in some developing countries; also it is greatly . A large number of women in these countries are not allowed to go to work or even go to . In this case, this is not an individual issue, but social problem. The governments should have some solution to this tendency, and at the same time they should promulgate a new legislation to protect women’s .On the other hand, the global economy is developing rapidly nowadays. In most corporations, distinguish men from women; they only focus on working efficiently. In this world, any employees who possess enough abilities and work in an effective way, be promoted to positions. Therefore, allocating the high level positions in companies to women is not necessary. Moreover, the instances of women in essential positions . Those women are very successful in their work and their lives.In conclusion, although the inequality between men and women has reduced, it still is a social issue worth . Personally, in my opinion we should create as many opportunities for women to have an equal life as we can.";The lack of female representation in senior roles within organizations is a widespread challenge faced in many developed nations. Although women make up half of the workforce, they remain significantly underrepresented in management and executive positions. I believe that mandating companies to reserve a specific percentage of management roles for women is an essential measure to foster greater gender equality in the workplace.This initiative would tackle the systemic barriers and biases that hinder women's advancement into leadership roles. Many organizations currently operate with unconscious biases, and women frequently encounter discrimination and stereotypes that impede their career growth. By implementing quotas, companies would be compelled to reassess their hiring and promotion practices, ensuring that women have equitable opportunities to vie for top positions.Furthermore, implementing quotas would yield various advantages for companies, such as access to a wider talent pool, increased diversity of viewpoints, and improved decision-making capabilities. Women contribute distinct experiences, skills, and insights that can lead to more innovative and effective business strategies. By harnessing this talent, companies can enhance their performance and competitiveness.Nevertheless, it is crucial to implement such measures thoughtfully to avoid tokenism and ensure that women are promoted based on merit, not merely to satisfy a quota. Companies should prioritize creating an inclusive and supportive work environment, offering training and development opportunities, and addressing the biases that obstruct women's progress.In summary, requiring companies to designate a certain percentage of management roles for women is a vital step toward achieving greater gender equality in the workplace. This approach not only addresses the systemic barriers faced by women but also offers numerous benefits to organizations and ultimately results in more diverse and effective leadership.
1390;News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in a newspaper. What factors do you think influence their decisions? Do we become used to bad news? Would it be better if more good news was reported?;. There are two factors that influence their decisions. The first is the kind of customers they aim at. each kind of readers and watchers has its own features. For example, if your customers are almost entirely teenagers, you have to concentrate on something attracting them such as stories, photographs of singer stars, film stars, funny tales, and fashion. It be very silly if you to provide teenagers with economic or news. On the contrary, and politicians may never read news about James Blunt or Keira Knightley. Therefore, what influences news editors’ decisions the most is the taste of their customers.The second factor is how hot and attractive the news is. Who or watch news from a year or a month ago or even about something that happened last week? The answer is . In the energetic and competitive world nowadays, people always ask for a really news. So that to satisfy customers, there is a pressure on all editors to find continually what has already happened not only yesterday but even an hour ago. Or else, they may lose their customers. None of editors wants that bleak future.The type of news is also an important consideration. Whether on television or in newspapers, we seem to get more of and become used to bad news. It is harder for us to come across a piece of good news. We can’t deny that bad things happen on Earth day by day. However, news editors try to gain more and more , which means more and more money, using bad news as a magnet. bad news makes us curious. We want to know why it is bad, what it is about, whether it influences us or not. As a result, we will buy newspapers or watch television to find out. And the happiest people are, of course, news editors.In my view it would be better if more good news reported. Bad news makes us good news makes us happy. There should an an equal amount of good and bad news. In that way we can give something bad a lot of thought while still being happy about the good news. Any inequalities between good news and bad news should be avoided. Nowadays we cannot live without news, and for that reason the role of news editors became very important. We should support them, and in turn they should try their best to provide us with useful news, both good and bad.;"News editors play a vital role in determining the information that reaches audiences through television and print media. Their choices regarding what stories to broadcast or print are influenced by various factors. Foremost among these is the relevance and impact of a story on the audience; editors often prioritize stories likely to engage viewers or readers, such as scandals, conflicts, or natural disasters. The availability of resources, including time, staff, and budget, also significantly shapes news selection.Commercial interests are another important factor, as the potential to attract advertisers and boost ratings can significantly influence editorial choices. The competitive nature of the news industry exacerbates this pressure, leading some outlets to prioritize sensational stories over more in-depth reporting. Consequently, negative news often takes center stage, as it tends to be more eye-catching and lucrative.Extended exposure to predominantly negative news can desensitize audiences, resulting in a normalization of bad news that can adversely affect mental health, contributing to heightened stress, anxiety, and a bleak outlook on life. In contrast, reporting more positive news could create a more balanced and hopeful perspective, showcasing successful initiatives, acts of heroism, and stories of resilience. Such reporting can inspire individuals and communities to embody positive behaviors and strive for societal improvement.In summary, while the factors influencing news editors' decisions are complex and varied, there is a strong argument for increased reporting of good news. By doing so, news organizations can foster a more informed, inspired, and resilient public, ultimately enhancing the well-being of individuals and communities. A balanced approach to news coverage that includes essential reporting on critical issues alongside uplifting narratives of human achievement and kindness is crucial for a healthy society."
1321;Newspapers have a significant influence on people’s ideas and opinions. Why is this happening? Is it a positive or negative situation?;Many people believe that newspapers play a pivotal role in shaping the way we think. There are numerous ways in which this affects our society, and I believe that this influence is mostly negative.Newspapers have long been a source of valuable information that has kept societies abreast of the latest happenings in the world. Since the average citizen has minimal knowledge about the information in expert analysis articles, well-established newspapers are powerfully poised to form public opinion through attention-grabbing images and carefully worded commentary. This leaves the reader no choice but to trust the accuracy of what they have read.Sadly, unbiased objectivity, which used to be the core idea behind journalism, seems to be a thing of the past. The arrival and spread of social media platforms has caused a gradual decline in print media subscriptions and their circulation, since readers tend to favor the internet and social media to stay informed about current affairs. This gave rise to a worrying trend of newspapers using sensationalist and controversial tactics to improve their sales. As a result, the constant barrage of bad news has led to a society that sees itself as more vulnerable and powerless than ever. To make matters worse, there are plenty of well-documented instances where newspapers have been used to spread false propaganda which is usually politically motivated.All in all, although newspapers are our lifeline to the world around us, the recent trend of publishing misinformation has had a mostly negative impact on readers. It is my hope that newspapers will go back to publishing impartial accounts of the latest news in the future.;The emergence of newspapers has significantly transformed how people access information, undeniably leaving a substantial mark on the shaping of public ideas and opinions. This impact can be attributed to several factors. First and foremost, newspapers offer a platform for a variety of perspectives and voices, exposing readers to different viewpoints and enhancing their understanding of a range of issues. Furthermore, they frequently include thorough analyses and editorials that provide valuable insights into current events, potentially influencing readers’ thoughts and choices.The effect of newspapers can be both beneficial and detrimental. On the positive side, they are essential in raising awareness and educating the public. Newspapers amplify marginalized voices and shine a light on social and political issues that may otherwise go unnoticed. Additionally, they promote critical thinking and stimulate meaningful debates among readers.Conversely, the influence of newspapers can take a negative turn if they engage in biased or sensational reporting. This can result in the dissemination of misinformation, reinforce stereotypes, and incite unnecessary panic or fear. Moreover, the concentration of newspaper ownership within a few individuals or corporations may lead to a narrow range of opinions and stifle diversity in thought.In summary, the substantial impact of newspapers on public ideas and opinions is a complex matter with both positive and negative consequences. While they hold the potential to educate, inform, and promote critical discourse, they also risk perpetuating biases and spreading misinformation. It is crucial for readers to engage with newspaper content critically, being aware of both its advantages and drawbacks. By doing so, we can leverage the positive aspects of newspapers to cultivate informed and active citizens.
1391;Nowadays environmental problems are too big to be managed by individual persons or individual countries. In other words, it is an international problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;An essential problem of the 21st century is world pollution. Currently the environment is so contaminated that urgent measures should be taken. A single individual cannot be blamed for the world pollution, however every person should take care of his or her habitat. In addition, it is vital that environmental issues are treated internationally.Lately, many presentations, conferences and international summits are held to deal with waste treatment, recycling, and soil and water contamination. joint efforts and consolidation can only help in the mutual war the ongoing environmental disaster. For instance, governments should offer support to companies and organizations, involved in manufacturing, industry or agriculture in order to find environment-friendly approaches. These could be special law regulations, recycling programs, helping courses in order to implement ISO certificates and many more.However, the influence of individuals over environment should not be ignored. If we do not that our planet is our home, we will never be able to take care of it. We have to contribute every day to the preservation of nature and environment. For example, always remember to save energy by switching off lamps, computers and everything that we do not use. Our next obligation is to separate waste and throw bulk only in the designated areas. Driving vehicles can also be environment friendly. For example, we have to avoid accelerating the engines too rapidly or using the air conditioning in the country, where it would be better to save energy and simply open the windows.To sum up, environmental problems should be handled by local and international authorities as well as individuals. Every single person should take care of the environment, moreover we have to bring up our children to be conscious citizens of a clean and preserved planet.;"The idea that environmental issues have surpassed the limits of individual and national jurisdictions, calling for a unified global response, strongly aligns with the present state of ecological concerns. I fully support the view that environmental challenges have transformed into an international dilemma, demanding coordinated action from the global community.The interconnected nature of the world's ecosystems highlights the urgency for a collective approach to address environmental issues. Take climate change, for instance; it exemplifies an international crisis, as greenhouse gas emissions from one nation can significantly influence global weather patterns, impacting numerous countries at once. Likewise, ocean pollution transcends borders and has emerged as a critical global issue, with plastic waste and harmful chemicals endangering marine life and affecting coastal ecosystems around the world.However, individual nations, despite their commendable efforts, often find themselves constrained in their ability to tackle these challenges independently. National policies and regulations can contribute to mitigating environmental degradation, but their efficacy is limited when the issues at hand are inherently global. Moreover, the economic and technological means required to effectively address these environmental challenges often surpass the capabilities of single nations, particularly those that are less economically developed.Thus, it is crucial for the international community to unite in sharing knowledge, technology, and financial resources to effectively combat environmental issues. International agreements like the Paris Agreement, along with global initiatives focusing on reducing emissions, safeguarding biodiversity, and promoting sustainable development, are essential steps forward. In summary, considering the cross-border nature of environmental challenges and the limitations of solitary national actions, it is clear that these problems are far too large for individual countries to manage alone, thereby underscoring the need for a collaborative global response."
1368;Nowadays families move to different countries for work and some think it has a negative effect on children (agree/disagree);Nowadays families move to different countries for work. Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Recent advancements, in technology and transportation in particular, are reshaping our world in an unprecedented manner. Nowadays, it is not unusual for people to work abroad. Most expatriates relocate their families to the countries . Some people argue that this phenomenon negatively affects children, however, I agree with those who believe the opposite is true.Those who think that relocating children to a new place is undesirable do so for many reasons. Their most common argument is the negative impact of moving on a child’s personality. There is no doubt that living in a different community comes with its challenges, especially to young people, as they get exposed to behaviours, actions and customs they might not be familiar with. As a result, children could possibly feel a lack of stability and some confusion. It is also likely that their patriotic feelings and sense of belonging to their home country could weaken as they would miss many opportunities to celebrate their national events.Nevertheless, I firmly believe that opinion to be ludicrous, as it seems that getting exposed to a new culture is beneficial in many ways. It fosters young social and emotional capabilities. Moreover, children living abroad have better opportunities to and practice new languages. Mastering more than one language improves not only their intellectual development, but also their opportunities in acquiring better jobs in the future. According to a recent study published by the University of Chicago, competency in more than one language increases employment chances on average by 200%.In conclusion, I strongly believe that living in a different country positively affects children in all aspects. Acquiring new languages, and an open minded and tolerant personality are just few examples of the many possible benefits.This essay presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt. The writer’s ideas are relevant and well‐supported. The arrangement of information and use of cohesive devices are fine, perhaps with a slight overuse in the second body paragraph. Sentence structures are complex, and the vocabulary is varied and appropriately used, except for some minor grammatical/spelling mistakes. This essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;The trend of families moving to different countries for work has become increasingly prevalent in our globalized society. While some contend that this can adversely affect children, I strongly disagree. In fact, I believe that such experiences can offer numerous advantages for young people.Admittedly, relocating to a new country can pose challenges for children, who must acclimate to a new environment, adjust to a different school, and forge new friendships. This transition can sometimes lead to feelings of isolation and uncertainty. However, these obstacles can be surmounted with the support of family and the chance to learn and thrive in a new context.On the flip side, moving internationally can significantly expand children's perspectives, expose them to a variety of cultures, and help them cultivate essential life skills such as adaptability and resilience. Living abroad often gives children the chance to learn new languages, connect with peers from diverse backgrounds, and develop a more well-rounded understanding of the world. Additionally, children who undergo international moves tend to be more open-minded, inquisitive, and empathetic toward others.Moreover, numerous companies and organizations provide strong support systems for expatriate families, including international schools, social clubs, and community networks. These resources can facilitate a smoother transition for children and help them find a sense of belonging in their new surroundings.In summary, while relocating to another country can indeed pose certain challenges for children, I firmly believe that the advantages significantly surpass the drawbacks. With appropriate support and a positive outlook, children can flourish in a new environment, acquire valuable skills, and gain a broader perspective on life. Ultimately, the journey of moving to a different country can be a deeply enriching experience for children, shaping their futures and expanding their horizons.
1350;Nowadays many people choose ready-made food and refuse to cook at home, why and what are the advantages/disadvantages?;Nowadays many people choose ready-made food and refuse to cook at home. Why do you think it happens? What are the advantages and disadvantages of such a choice?It is a very popular practice in the modern society to order ready-made food from restaurants, rather than cooking at home. The main reasons for such a tendency may be cheap prices in some restaurants and people’s desire to save some time . Even though ordering food some obvious advantages, its disadvantages should not be underestimated.On the one hand, ordering prepared food may be the best choice for a busy person, who does not have time for cooking and cleaning. Cooking food at home requires a considerable amount of time, moreover the cleaning process may take even more time and resources than cooking itself. For example, cooking a simple dish such as chicken with rice home requires significant amounts of water and electricity for electrical appliances such as the oven and dishwasher. Hence, having an opportunity to order food from a restaurant will save a lot of time, electricity and water.On the other hand, delegating the process of cooking to some restaurant a dramatic disadvantage of not having the information about the ingredients used in the meals. With high demand, grow the volumes of required products, which sometimes can affect the quality of purchased produce. For example, it is a very common practice in some restaurants to make salads from products that are about to go bad and mask the rotten scent by adding some chemicals and spices. Hence, some restaurants may use poor quality products or chemicals for boosting taste and preservatives, which may have a negative effect on the customer’s health in the long run.In conclusion, ordering food from restaurants may be a tempting choice for people who have no time for cooking at home, but this approach has a critical disadvantage of being not informed about the ingredients used in the meal, which can have destructive consequences.This response covers the task requirements by giving a reason why people would choose to buy ready-made food and discussing the advantages and disadvantages of this trend. The ideas are conveyed quite clearly and supported by examples, paragraphing helps to present the information in a neat and easy to follow way, and the level of coherence is adequate in this essay. A range of complex sentence forms and advanced vocabulary is used and there are very few instances of erroneous grammar or inaccurate expressions (see corrections underlined in blue). Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.;In today's fast-paced society, the preference for ready-made meals over home cooking has become increasingly common. One of the main contributors to this trend is the convenience and time efficiency that ready-made options provide. With busy lifestyles and tight schedules, many people struggle to find time for cooking. Ready-made food, including takeout, restaurant dishes, and pre-packaged snacks, presents a quick and hassle-free solution to hunger, appealing to those with limited time.Another factor influencing the popularity of ready-made meals is the wide range of choices they offer. Restaurants and food outlets serve an array of cuisines and dishes, enabling consumers to savor different flavors and culinary experiences without having to cook. This variety is particularly enticing in urban settings where dining options abound.Nonetheless, there are notable drawbacks to relying heavily on ready-made food. One of the primary concerns is the impact on health. Many pre-prepared meals are high in calories, salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats, which can contribute to obesity, heart disease, and other health issues when consumed excessively. In contrast, home cooking allows for the use of fresh ingredients and greater control over nutrition, which isn’t always possible with ready-made options.On the flip side, ready-made food does have its social advantages. Dining out or ordering in can transform mealtime into a social gathering, whether it’s a night out with friends, a family dinner, or a lunch break with colleagues. It offers opportunities for socialization and relaxation, breaking away from the routine of cooking and cleaning.In summary, while ready-made food provides convenience, variety, and social opportunities, it also carries health risks and lacks the nutritional control and personal touch that home cooking offers. A balanced approach that blends the convenience of ready-made meals with regular home cooking could provide the best of both worlds, allowing individuals to enjoy the benefits while minimizing the downsides.
1316;Nowadays many teenagers have a celebrity who they follow as a role model. Some people think this is not a good idea, because celebrities often set a bad example. Do you agree or disagree?;It is not uncommon for teenagers to worship celebrities. From singers to actors, many young people around the world look up to these stars and attempt to emulate their lifestyles. In my opinion, allowing children to idolize celebrities can often be detrimental, as they frequently set a poor example.Many of today’s celebrities tend to lack moral values, and they promote behaviour inappropriate for young people. For instance, some music videos feature explicit lyrics glorifying drug use and violence. In addition, the media often reports on celebrities who indulge in excessive partying or drinking alcohol despite being underage. These types of headlines can have a negative influence on impressionable teens who might falsely believe that they should follow suit to appear cool or successful.Poor morals aren’t the only issue, as many popular stars are also well-known for their irresponsible spending habits. They routinely splurge on luxury items such as designer clothing or expensive cars without any consideration for budgeting or saving money responsibly. This kind of behaviour is dangerous because it is normalizing materialism and teaching teens that costly possessions will bring them happiness instead of focusing on what really matters in life: meaningful relationships, knowledge, and hard work.To conclude, young adults should keep in mind that society’s perception of fame and fortune is based on temporary, insubstantial things rather than what actually matters. In the grand scheme of things, it would be far more beneficial for teenagers to spend time developing their own set of values rooted in quality education and strong family relationships.;The trend of teenagers looking up to celebrities as role models has become increasingly common in today's society. While some believe that idolizing celebrities can be harmful due to their often poor behavior, I find myself agreeing with this viewpoint.Due to their public nature, celebrities are constantly in the spotlight, and their actions are often amplified for all to see. Unfortunately, many engage in behaviors that do not set a constructive example for young admirers. For example, some celebrities may advocate for unhealthy lifestyles, involving substance abuse, irresponsible spending, or a lack of commitment to meaningful causes. When teenagers idolize these figures, they may unintentionally adopt similar practices, which can lead to long-term negative effects on their personal development and well-being.Additionally, the pervasive influence of celebrity culture on social media can foster unrealistic expectations and consumerism among youth. The curated, often misleading images of celebrity lifestyles can push young people to chase unattainable beauty ideals, material wealth, or fame, rather than concentrating on more meaningful pursuits like education, personal growth, or community involvement.That said, it's important to acknowledge that not all celebrities offer poor examples. Some utilize their influence to highlight important issues, support charitable initiatives, or exhibit hard work and resilience. These positive role models can genuinely inspire teenagers to effect change in their communities or pursue their interests with commitment and integrity.In summary, while I believe that teenagers' tendency to emulate celebrities can be concerning due to the risks of negative influence, it’s essential to recognize that not all celebrities are detrimental role models. It’s vital for parents, educators, and the celebrities themselves to encourage young fans to critically assess the actions and values of their idols, fostering a more balanced and positive influence.
1359;Nowadays more and more people want to live by themselves, why is this happening?;Nowadays more and more people want to live by themselves. What are the reasons? Is it a positive or negative trend?These days a vast majority of people want to lead an independent life. The fundamental reason lies in people’s educational qualifications that fuel their craving for freedom in life. This can be seen as a positive trend because living alone is likely to nurture a mature mindset at early stages of one’s life.Many people are well educated to stand up on their own. Tertiary education broadens their horizons, and they wish to experience freedom of life. With a very good educational background it becomes easier to find a well-paid job, and with lucrative income they gain confidence to lead an independent life, thereby achieving their goals. For example, engineering graduates can find a job in another town and their salary is enough for them to move and settle down there. This enables them to move away from their family and live on their own.Living alone helps one to develop maturity, which can be seen as a positive impact on individuals and the society as a whole. Being independent means young people have to face life challenges alone and going through this process improves their resilience. They become more responsible, as they have to take care of themselves and develop budgeting skills and saving habits, for their future needs as well. Better planning of their finances nurtures the custom of wise spending at early stages of adult life.In conclusion, the reason why many people wish to live independently these days is because their education level gives them both the awareness of freedom in life and means of achieving it. Since living alone promotes one’s maturity, it seems to be a positive trend in today’s society.This response covers the task requirements by addressing the two parts of the question, why people choose to live alone and whether this is a positive trend. The ideas are clearly explained and supported, the information is organised in paragraphs in an easy to follow way, and the level of coherence is adequate. A range of complex sentence forms is used and there are no grammatical errors. Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.;"In recent years, more and more people have chosen to live alone, a trend that spans various age groups and demographics, raising questions about its underlying causes. A key factor driving this shift is the desire for independence and autonomy; living solo enables individuals to make their own choices, establish their own routines, and enjoy personal space without interruption.Another contributing element is the evolving nature of family structures and social connections. With the rise of nuclear families and smaller household sizes, many individuals no longer reside with extended family members. Additionally, increasing mobility for education and career opportunities has created physical distances between friends and family, resulting in a greater number of people living independently.Economic considerations also play an important role in this trend. As the economy grows and personal incomes rise, more individuals find themselves financially capable of affording their own living arrangements. Coupled with the variety of urban housing options available, choosing to live alone has become a appealing and feasible option.Moreover, the pursuit of self-discovery and personal growth drives many to prefer solo living. This lifestyle grants individuals the freedom to focus on their interests and aspirations without external distractions, offering a chance to gain deeper self-understanding and fostering resilience, responsibility, and a stronger sense of identity.In summary, the growing inclination to live alone is a complex phenomenon shaped by factors such as the need for independence, changing family dynamics, economic conditions, and personal development. As societal norms and individual priorities continue to evolve, it seems likely that this trend will endure, reflecting a broader shift towards prioritizing personal freedom and autonomy."

This shift has become a prominent characteristic of contemporary life, as people enthusiastically embrace popular activities and adjust their habits accordingly. But what fuels this behavior, and what prompts people to invest more time in these pursuits?One significant factor is the impact of social media. Platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter have fostered a culture of sharing and comparison, where individuals feel a strong pressure to stay abreast of the latest trends and document their experiences. This has fostered a sense of fear of missing out (FOMO), driving people to spend more time scrolling through their feeds in search of the newest and most popular activities to engage in.Additionally, the inherent human attraction to novelty and excitement plays a crucial role in this trend. People are instinctively inclined toward new experiences that provide a sense of thrill and adventure. With a constant influx of information online, discovering new hobbies, cuisines, and events that pique our interest has never been easier.Furthermore, the ascent of influencer culture has significantly influenced how people structure their daily activities. Social media influencers regularly highlight the latest trends and products, often creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity around specific activities. Consequently, individuals feel an urge to participate in these trends, spending more time on them to feel connected to the influencers and their communities.In summary, the reasons driving individuals to dedicate more time to altering their daily activities in pursuit of the latest trends are complex and multifaceted. Influences from social media, the quest for novelty, and the rise of influencer culture all play a part in this phenomenon. As technology continues to advance and social media platforms evolve, it is likely that this trend will persist, influencing how people allocate their time and interact with their surroundings.
701;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. In this essay, the reason for wasting food and the acts which can be done by humans to reduce the amount of food one throws away will be thorougly discussed.Firstly, people waste food as one tends to be satisfied with the amount one eats. Thus, people order food more than one can eat as one can not estimate the amount of food. The amount of food one person can consume differs on one's conditions at that moment. The conditions include mood, physical features and activities one did on that particular day. Furthermore, one wants to taste all sorts of food, however, one can not eat all of those. Sometimes, people order food which are well decorated just to take a photo of it and upload it on social media such as Instagram. After taking photo, people just leave the food. The above mentioned reasons can be the causes of wastage of food.Apparently, people can reduce the amount of food they throw away. The restaurants can provide more informations about the amount and taste briefly to avoid the situation that consumers can not finish the food and are dissatisfied with the taste or smell. Moreover, consumers have to make a wise decision so that they do not waste both food and money. People should co-operate to reduce the wastage of food as it causes pollution on land. It leads to bad smell and brings insects to the areas.Conclusively, it is quite clear that people greatly waste food and there are a few ways for people to follow so as to reduce the amount of waste food.;"Food waste has emerged as a critical issue in our society today. A substantial amount of food is squandered by individuals and households, leading to unnecessary waste and damaging environmental effects. In my view, there are several factors that contribute to this problem. Firstly, the sheer variety of food choices available in stores and restaurants often results in over-purchasing, leading to surplus food that frequently gets discarded. Additionally, inadequate meal planning and insufficient storage facilities further exacerbate food spoilage and waste.Another contributing factor is the misunderstanding surrounding ""use by"" and ""best before"" dates on food products. Many individuals erroneously believe that food becomes inedible once these dates pass, leading to the unnecessary disposal of items that are still safe to eat. Furthermore, the proliferation of a ""throwaway"" culture, wherein food is treated as a readily disposable commodity, has intensified the problem.To mitigate food waste, several proactive measures can be taken. Firstly, individuals can engage in meal planning and create shopping lists to prevent overbuying. Restaurants and retailers can contribute by offering smaller portion sizes and selling ""imperfect"" or near-expiration items at reduced prices. Additionally, public education and awareness campaigns can be initiated to enlighten consumers about the importance of minimizing food waste and understanding ""use by"" and ""best before"" labels accurately. Lastly, enhancing food storage and preservation methods can extend the shelf life of various products. By adopting these strategies, we can significantly curb food waste and foster a more sustainable food system. Ultimately, addressing this issue requires a collective effort from individuals, businesses, and governments to champion a culture of food conservation."
1354;Nowadays people waste a lot of food, why is this happening and how to reduce waste?;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?At the time when famines heavily strike impoverished third world countries, many people living in wealthy countries waste tremendous amounts of food daily. In my opinion, understanding the probable reasons of this phenomenon is important and may lead us to some applicable solutions that will result in reducing food waste.The low cost of food seems to be one of the obvious reasons, exacerbating the problem. Due to the revolutionary technological achievements, people have increased both the quality and the quantity of their crops. In turn, according to the laws of supply and demand, the prices of the crops have immensely dropped. A recent study of the FAO stated that the global crops prices have dropped 50 per cent over the last decade. This enabled people to buy excessive amounts of food without a real need.Furthermore, the absence of strict regulations to discourage or punish this attitude can also be considered a major cause. Not everyone is aware that wasting food may create problems. Consequently, they are likely to resist any calls for controlling the consumption of dietary supplies unless they are forced by the power of law. Several countries in the world saw a drop in their national food waste after implementing a ban on the excessive purchasing of food.Fortunately, there are some possible approaches that can be adopted by both people and governments. Firstly, raising the awareness of this issue is immensely important. Using social media platforms can draw public attention to the potential dangers of food waste and how communities can confront it. Secondly, enforcing laws that prohibit the wasting of food by people and companies will deter such harmful practice.In conclusion, the decreased price of food as well as lack of regulations allowed the unfortunate trend of throwing away food to continue. I believe that creating awareness and legislation are parts of a straightforward solution to this issue.The writer explored the reasons for throwing away food and suggested some solutions, effortlessly conveying his/her ideas in this well-written IELTS essay. The information is presented in an orderly, logical and coherent way. A wide range of vocabulary is used in this written response. The sentence structures are varied and the vocabulary is impressive. Overall, this essay could achieve IELTS Band 8.;"Food waste has emerged as a critical issue in contemporary society. A substantial portion of the food produced worldwide ends up being wasted, which poses both economic and environmental challenges. Several factors contribute to the high levels of food waste. One primary cause is inadequate planning and poor management of food purchases. Many people purchase more food than they actually require, resulting in spoilage and eventual disposal. Furthermore, misleading ""use-by"" and ""best-before"" dates often lead consumers to throw away perfectly edible items too soon.Cultural attitudes towards food also play a significant role in this problem. In various cultures, there is a common practice of over-catering for events and gatherings, leading to an excess of food that often goes to waste. Additionally, the popularity of convenience foods and ready-to-eat meals fosters a ""throwaway"" mentality, treating food as a disposable product rather than a valuable resource.To combat food waste, several effective strategies can be adopted. Firstly, individuals can enhance meal planning and create grocery lists to prevent overbuying. Secondly, proper food storage and inventive use of leftovers can help minimize waste. Governments and businesses also have a critical part to play by enacting policies that promote the redistribution of surplus food to those in need. Raising awareness about food waste and encouraging a sustainable mindset can inspire people to adopt more thoughtful and responsible food consumption habits. By implementing these measures, we can make significant strides in reducing food waste and advancing toward a more sustainable food system."
1351;Nowadays that many women have full time jobs, it is logical to share the housework evenly between men and women (agree/disagree);Nowadays in many countries women have full time jobs. Therefore, it is logical to share household tasks evenly between men and women. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Nowadays an ever-increasing number of women work full time, and in this reality it is widely believed that house chores should be shared between men and women equally. I strongly agree with this statement.One of the reasons for sharing housework between is to promote gender equality. A stereotype that has existed a long time is that females ought to stay home, taking care of the family once they got married. This includes looking after the children and doing all of the housework, which is fairly labour-intensive. However, this approach could have quite a few disadvantages. It would render women less able of keeping abreast of what is happening in the job market, thus forming a lifestyle where they might find it arduous to step into the society again. To avoid this, many women are willing to get back into the workforce soon after their maternity leave, and once they do, it makes sense that their husbands should share part of the household chores, to fulfill their family responsibilities.Nevertheless, we cannot be oblivious several drawbacks of this trend. One potential downside is that men are less experienced in dealing with household tasks. This is because many seldom take an active role in doing housework, according to customs of many countries. As a result, they may end up doing household tasks in a less than perfect way, which could contribute to some unnecessary quarrels between partners, hindering their family bond. However, the likelihood of this happening isn’t very high, because wives can offer some tips or guidance to their husbands when they learn how to share house chores such as mopping floors or doing laundry.To sum up, although some conflicts might be triggered when equally sharing the duties of household tasks, the benefits of this trend are relatively oblivious.The writer covered the task well by discussing the positives and negatives of sharing housework equally between men and women. Each paragraph has a clear purpose and assists with orderly presentation of ideas, making this essay easy to follow. The ideas are explained and substantiated, and the writer’s opinion is clear. The range of vocabulary is wide enough to avoid unnecessary repetition. Accuracy of expression could be improved (see corrections underlined in blue), but all in all this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;"I wholeheartedly believe that in today's world, where many women hold full-time positions, it is only sensible to distribute household chores fairly between men and women. As more women enter the workforce, the traditional roles within the home are becoming increasingly outdated. Women are no longer solely tasked with household management and family care; they are now equally contributing to the family income.Equally sharing household responsibilities is not just a question of fairness; it is a necessity. When both partners work full-time, they require time to rest and pursue personal interests. If one individual takes on most of the household duties, it can result in exhaustion and resentment. By splitting the chores, both partners can achieve a healthier work-life balance and alleviate stress.Furthermore, dividing housework can strengthen relationships and enhance equality at home. When men and women share responsibilities, it reflects mutual respect and acknowledgment of each other's efforts. This can lead to a more harmonious and supportive living environment.In summary, given the evolving dynamics of modern life, it is both logical and essential to distribute household tasks evenly between men and women. This approach not only fosters fairness and equality but also enables both partners to sustain a healthy work-life balance while nurturing a stronger, more supportive relationship. By adopting this perspective, we can move toward a more balanced and equitable society where both men and women can thrive in their careers and personal lives. Ultimately, sharing household responsibilities is a step toward a more progressive and harmonious community."
25;Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?;"It is a serious problem that there is an inadequate number of students who tend to select science as their major subject in universities in many countries. In my view, students may think that studying science has not a good career path. Also, this issue may deeply affect the international state of a country.The main reason why people do not think to study science is that they may see science as something unpractical, and potentially, they are hard to find a job when they graduate. Students are generally afraid that there is no employment opportunity after they graduate from university. Unlike engineering and business management, in which fields employers provide plenty of vocational positions for graduated students because there are lots of companies activating in these fields and universities may provide some practical training courses and internships. Students studying science have a relatively narrow way to walk, and may just be scientists. Moreover, although a successful scientist can get a massive bonus from some prizes, it is too hard to accomplish and is more likely to fail. Therefore, Students will avoid taking those risks and choose other subjects that are relatively stable and easy to find a job.This trend will eventually decrease the state of a country. Developing science can provide a strong and firm foundation for a country to establish a healthy and prosperous community. If there are not enough scientists, the whole scientific ability will decrease. Not only will the government pay extra money to other foreign countries to buy the required technology such as military equipment, but the public needs to spend more time and pay more effort to maintain the international standard production rate of a country. It is extremely dangerous that a nation easily suffers from a financial crisis and, finally, it influences the living standard of its citizens and causes damage to its financial systems.In summary, while science is regarded as a ""useless"" subject because of its narrow career path and low success rate, it is vital that the economic systems would be affected if a country develop without scientists.";The declining interest in science subjects among university students has become a significant issue in numerous countries. A major factor behind this trend is the perception that science courses are difficult and highly competitive. Many students find the demanding academic standards and the need for strong mathematical skills to be intimidating. Furthermore, the lack of practical experience and inadequate resources in schools can render science subjects uninviting and overly abstract, resulting in diminished student interest.Another crucial element influencing this decline is the insufficient career guidance and counseling offered to students. Many young individuals are not aware of the wide array of career opportunities in science, including fields like biotechnology, environmental science, and data analysis. Consequently, they often gravitate towards more conventional and seemingly secure career options such as business or law. The implications of this trend are widespread and concerning. A deficit of skilled scientists and researchers can impede advancements in technology, medical progress, and innovative solutions to urgent environmental challenges.This issue manifests in a slowdown of research and development across various sectors, which can lead to brain drain and decreased competitiveness in the global marketplace. Additionally, a population lacking science literacy may struggle with making informed decisions and engaging in critical thinking in their daily lives. To combat this problem, it is vital for governments, educational institutions, and industry leaders to collaborate in promoting science education, providing career guidance, and delivering hands-on learning opportunities that make science more engaging and accessible. By taking these steps, we can motivate and prepare the next generation of scientists and innovators to drive progress in their fields. Ultimately, acknowledging the significance of science education and taking unified action is crucial to reversing this trend and creating a more scientifically literate and innovative society.
1361;Obesity is becoming common among children, give reasons and solutions (from Target Band ;"This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskObesity was once considered a disease of adults; however, it is becoming increasingly common among children. Why do you think this is happening? What can be done to help children stay healthy?Write at least 250 wordsFor many years obesity was perceived as a condition occurring only in adult life. However, in recent years the number of children suffering from obesity has grown significantly. There are several causes and numerous solutions which can be used to tackle this worrying phenomenon, and this essay will present a couple of them.While some reasons for childhood obesity are genetic, others include poor food choices exacerbated by easy availability of fast food, insufficient physical activity and a history of family members being overweight. Unlike the former, the latter factors can be changed, if the adults in the child’s life gain awareness and are willing to take action.To begin with, health is a complex matter which requires a balanced approach. In other words, there isn’t a single solution to maintain health, on the contrary, it is rather a mixture of multiple factors, such as and regular physical activity. For this reason, increasing the awareness of healthy habits among children is a responsibility of utmost importance. What is more, it can be easily achieved through the education system.On the other hand, children’s education might to stop the situation from worsening. Along with well designed health education schemes, we should also try to stop food companies from overusing sugar in products the young ones. It has been proven that more than 70% of the products available in an average supermarket contain dangerously high levels of white sugar. Sugar rich diet not only causes a significant weight gain, but also contributes to diseases, such as diabetes in young population.To summarize, emphasis put on the awareness of healthy living among children is invaluable. Furthermore, combining healthy habits with stopping food companies from in products which are easily children can be effectively implemented by the governments. Positive outcomes of such measures taken today will definitely have a long lasting effect on the future generations.This is a well developed response to the question. Relevant key points are included in the answer. Appropriate examples are also used to corroborate the writer’s point of view. Paragraphing is skillfully managed, information and ideas are logically sequenced. A wide range of vocabulary is used to allow certain flexibility and precision. Also, a variety of sentence structures is used. Accuracy of expression needs some attention (see corrections underlined in blue). Overall, the essay could achieve Band 8 in IELTS.";The rise of obesity among children has become a critical global issue. Several factors contribute to this troubling trend. Firstly, the increase in sedentary behavior, with children spending much of their time indoors playing video games or watching television, has greatly diminished their levels of physical activity. Additionally, the widespread availability and low cost of junk food and sugary drinks have made these unhealthy options a regular part of many children's diets, resulting in excessive calorie intake and poor nutrient consumption.Another significant factor is the lack of knowledge and awareness among parents and caregivers regarding the necessity of a balanced diet and regular exercise for children. Due to busy lifestyles, many parents resort to convenient food options that are high in fat, salt, and sugar, often without recognizing the negative long-term health effects on their children.To address this escalating issue, various solutions can be implemented. Incorporating physical education and activities into school curriculums can enhance children's energy expenditure and promote healthier lifestyles. Schools can also play a crucial role by offering nutritionally balanced meals in their cafeterias, restricting unhealthy snack options, and encouraging water as the primary beverage.Parents and caregivers have an important role as well. They can promote outdoor play, limit screen time, and prepare healthier meals at home. Additionally, community-based programs, such as youth sports leagues, can offer children opportunities for physical activity while fostering social interaction and enjoyment.Ultimately, addressing childhood obesity requires a comprehensive approach that engages schools, parents, and the broader community. By encouraging physical activity and healthy eating habits from an early age, we can prevent obesity and associated health issues, paving the way for a healthier future generation. It is essential to take action now to educate, support, and create environments that motivate children to adopt and sustain healthy lifestyles. By doing so, we can significantly reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity and cultivate a society that prioritizes health and wellness.

Particularly among the younger generation, there is a noticeable trend toward choosing sugary drinks over more nutritious options. This shift can largely be attributed to the extensive availability and aggressive marketing tactics used to promote these beverages. With sugary drinks being both easily accessible and heavily advertised, they become an enticing and convenient choice for many individuals.Another contributing factor is the general lack of awareness regarding the detrimental effects of excessive sugar intake. Many people do not recognize the connection between sugary drinks and various health issues, including obesity, diabetes, and dental problems. Additionally, the fast-paced lifestyle of modern society often leads individuals to opt for quick and convenient drink options, rather than taking the time to prepare healthier alternatives.To tackle this concern, several measures can be taken. First and foremost, launching educational campaigns to raise awareness about the health risks associated with sugary beverages could be beneficial. Schools and workplaces can play pivotal roles by fostering healthy hydration habits and ensuring access to clean water and unsweetened drink choices. Governments might also consider implementing taxes on sugary drinks to decrease their appeal to consumers.On a personal level, individuals can make a positive impact by consciously choosing healthier drink options. Selecting water, unsweetened tea, or coffee can significantly lower sugar consumption. Furthermore, supporting brands that prioritize healthier beverages and encouraging others to do the same can help foster a shift in drinking habits. By collaborating on these efforts, we can diminish the prevalence of sugary drink consumption and advocate for a healthier lifestyle for all. Ultimately, addressing this issue is vital to avert long-term health repercussions and to cultivate a healthier, more sustainable future.
1418;People attend college or university for many different reasons (for example, new experiences, career preparation, or to increase knowledge).;Why do you think people attend college or university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Many people after their high school years for several reason which they choose . I believe that the most common reason why people to have new experiences on life , to prepare for a career, and to increase their knowledge of their personality.Firstly, many people to have new experience in life. Many students leave their home and move to live when they go to university. This is the first time that they had to make a resolution on their own, without their parents’ help. Making their own decisions will increase their knowledge of themselves. Moreover, students university can meet different students from different nationalities and religions so students can learn about different around the world.Secondly, many people go to university or collage to prepare for a career.

All of these prepare them for their career.Also, students attend university or college to increase their self-knowledge of their personality life. They attend increase their knowledge in subjects which they find interesting. For example, many students study science because they are in science but they work .To sum up, I think people should not only focus on a career when they go to university or college. They have to follow to have new experience and knowledge about their personality and the great world around them which they live in.;Enrolling in college or university marks a pivotal moment in a person's life, motivated by various factors. For many, the desire to gain new experiences and broaden their perspectives drives their decision. College life presents a distinctive chance to venture beyond familiar boundaries, forge new friendships, and participate in a wide array of activities. Students can engage in clubs, join sports teams, or volunteer for causes that resonate with them, all of which help in cultivating new skills, forming connections, and creating lasting memories.Some individuals pursue higher education specifically for career advancement. In today’s competitive job landscape, obtaining a degree is often necessary for many professions.

1253;People living in large cities have to face many problems in everyday life. What are those problems?Should the government encourage people to move to regional towns?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is not surprise to see that major cities are struggling with various issues which may associate with goverment and public issues as well.These issues are mild in some cities where as severe and vulnerable in few cities.Some of the common problems are increased crime rate,reduced safety,air pollution,noise pollution,flood,mechanical life and reduced greenery.The main cause for the above issues are increased population,uncontrolled carbon emission,poorly planned road and other public facilities such as underground drainage,contaminated water,roads and electricity.In general if the government take steps to control the above mentioned issues by implenting good law and orders which can improve public safety and happiness.Assist the sanitary boards with proper funding which may help to reduce water stagnant during rainy season.Funding for new research and developments may enhance to clear air and water pollution which can bring good health to the local residents.In contrast government may consider to develop the nearest towns with basic facilities such as modern housing,educational advancements,good roads,water and sanitary facilities. These facilities enhance the people to move to smaller town which may enhance to manage the key issues which are currently facing in the major cities.For instance Delhi,Capital of India seriously struggling with severe air pollution and lack of security which is heavily populated.Researches says that these problems can be reduced if the population rate is reduced.Meantime some group of people suggests that if the government may adopt new technology or structure which are following by any successful cities in the world.I personally feels that this also could be a better solution if it can be adopted by the government.By arguing the possitive and negative impacts it is difficult to conclude which option may works better to sove the issues.;Residing in major cities can be an overwhelming experience, filled with a variety of challenges that impact daily life. One of the key issues is the steep cost of living, which includes skyrocketing housing prices and inflated costs for essentials such as food and transportation. Furthermore, traffic congestion and pollution are common problems, as the large number of residents and vehicles can lead to blocked streets and deteriorating air quality.Another critical concern is the burden placed on public services like healthcare and education, which can become overwhelmed due to the high population density. This often results in long waits for medical assistance and overcrowded classrooms that detract from the educational experience. Additionally, the fast-paced, competitive nature of urban environments can contribute to heightened stress levels, as people struggle to navigate the demands of city life.Given these challenges, the question arises as to whether the government should encourage relocation to regional towns. In my view, it absolutely should. By providing incentives for individuals to move to less populated areas, the government can help reduce the strain on major cities and enhance overall quality of life. For example, regional towns typically offer more affordable housing, less traffic congestion, and a healthier environment. Additionally, public services in these regions are often less overwhelmed, resulting in more personalized care and attention. Success stories from countries like Australia illustrate how government initiatives aimed at attracting residents to smaller towns can lead to flourishing communities and a more balanced population distribution. By adopting similar strategies, governments can foster a more sustainable and enjoyable living experience for their citizens.
645;People often think about creating an ideal society, but most of the times fail in making this happen.What is your opinion about an ideal societyHow can we create an ideal society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"One of the ambition of the people is to create a harmonious community to live in. Unfortunately, individuals often fail to create one. This essay will discuss what is an ideal society, as well as ways on how to make it happen.An ideal community is a place where peace of mind over shadows fear. We all now that everyone wants a place that is criminal free. For example, people can just walk in an aisle without thinking of being raped or kidnapped. Moreover, it is a community in which discrimination, prejudice and racism is prohibited. In short, everyone is treated equally regardless of gender, colors, religions, social status, jobs and looks. It also means that, people can just walk in and out of a hospital or establishments without being looked down or degraded by other people especially those with high status.However, it is difficult for people to meet this kind of standards. This mainly because nobody is made perfect and as a human being we are mostly dominated by hatred, jealousy and selfishness. Although people fail to have a perfect society, there are some ways on how to have a near perfect place to live. First of all, government should make the lives of the people a better one by being an active role model to the citizens. There should not be corruption involve amongst the higher ups. Also, as what the saying goes ""learning should start at home"", it means that, parents should the take the initiative to educate their children proper manners in dealing with other people. In Japan, children were taught in a very young age on how to treat other people. That is why they always bow down their head as a sign of respect.To conclude, creating an essential environment can be challenging and demanding for all of us. Eventhough, it is impossible to make, each one of us can has the capacity to contribute to make society an almost perfect one.";The idea of an ideal society has been a subject of debate among philosophers, policymakers, and individuals for centuries. In my view, while achieving such a society is undoubtedly challenging, it is not out of reach. An ideal society, in my interpretation, is one where every individual has access to essential needs such as healthcare, education, and economic opportunities, all while living in harmony with both the environment and one another.A significant challenge in creating an ideal society arises from the wide array of human needs and values. What one individual deems ideal may differ from another’s perspective. Nonetheless, I believe there are fundamental principles that can steer us towards this aspiration. Firstly, education is crucial in cultivating individuals who are informed, compassionate, and actively engaged in their communities. By ensuring everyone has access to quality education, we can nurture a populace that is better equipped to make informed choices and contribute positively to society.Secondly, economic equality is vital. Societies with significant disparities between the wealthy and the impoverished are more prone to social unrest and present fewer opportunities for the disadvantaged. To address this, policies that promote a fair distribution of wealth, such as progressive taxation and social welfare programs, are essential. For instance, countries like Norway and Denmark, which have established strong social safety nets, enjoy high levels of social cohesion and citizen happiness.Finally, environmental sustainability is essential for the enduring health of any society. This entails embracing practices that minimize our carbon footprint, conserve natural resources, and safeguard biodiversity. Collaboration between governments and individuals is necessary to implement and support eco-friendly policies and lifestyles. In summary, realizing an ideal society calls for a comprehensive approach that emphasizes education, economic equality, and environmental sustainability. The path may be long and intricate, but with collective commitment to these principles, we can progress towards our vision of an ideal society.
1326;People should follow the local customs and traditions, when they come to live in a new country. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The globalised world these days makes it simpler than ever before for people to relocate and start building a life in a new country. As everyone comes from their own cultural background, a question arises of whether or not people should be expected to follow the customs of their host country. I completely agree with the view that while learning about the local customs may require some time and effort, it is valuable and will aid the integration of the newcomers into society.In many cultures following the local customs means showing respect, which is an important moral value in nearly every culture. The opposite is also true: disregarding traditions is often seen as a sign of disrespect. In order to establish good neighbourly relationships and feel welcome in the new place, it is important to demonstrate the effort to become part of the community. By expressing an interest in learning traditions, new arrivals gain a chance to interact with their neighbours and colleagues, get to know them and build some connections in the new country.Another positive aspect is the enhanced feeling of belonging that people get from participating in activities others around them are doing. When a national festival is in full swing, standing on the sidelines might make people feel excluded and perhaps even homesick, whereas joining others opens up opportunities to attend special events together, go to parties, meet new people and feel part of the celebrations. In Australia, for example, Easter is a very special time of the year and some of the traditional activities include Easter egg decoration and gifting, and baking hot cross buns; sharing your designs and recipes with others is an excellent conversation starter.In conclusion, learning the customs and traditions of one’s new country doesn’t mean a loss of their own culture. On the contrary, it is an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of cultural connections and should be embraced as a positive experience.";"When people move to a new country, the question of adhering to local customs and traditions often comes up. I believe it is important for newcomers to embrace these customs and traditions as a means of successfully integrating into their new community. Respecting and valuing the local culture plays a crucial role in fostering harmony and building connections.By adopting local practices, newcomers show their willingness to adapt and honor the way of life in the host country. This approach cultivates positive interactions with locals, minimizes the risk of unintentionally offending anyone, and eases the transition into the new setting. For example, in certain cultures, it is customary to remove shoes before entering a home as a sign of respect; neglecting to do so could be viewed as impolite. By adhering to such practices, individuals can prevent misunderstandings and create stronger ties with their new community.Additionally, following local customs can greatly enhance one’s cultural experience and broaden one’s worldview. Engaging deeply in a new culture can be a rewarding and enlightening journey, providing insights into local history, values, and beliefs. However, it’s important to recognize that individuals should not feel compelled to completely forsake their own cultural backgrounds. Instead, they should aim to strike a balance between honoring local traditions and preserving their unique cultural identity.In closing, I maintain that individuals should strive to embrace the customs and traditions of their new country. This not only aids in their successful integration into the community but also fosters personal growth and development as global citizens, enriching their understanding and appreciation of the diverse cultures that exist worldwide."
1370;People should not work beyond the retirement age (agree/disagree);Some believe that people should not continue to work once they reach the age of retirement. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your experience.In recent years, with the improvement in healthcare sector and better , people are able to live longer and contribute to the economic progress of a nation more, compared to the past. Some see this as an entirely positive development, while others point out the drawbacks of working beyond the retirement age.Delaying retirement enables individuals to actively contribute to the society. On a personal level, working past retirement age provides an avenue for individuals to remain not only physically but also mentally active. Moreover, this option empowers the ageing population to be financially independent and economically self-sustainable past retirement age. In countries with growing ageing population such as Singapore, for instance, citizens are given an option to work beyond their retirement age based on the demands of their job and their capability to handle these tasks. Hence, working beyond retirement age empowers workers, ensures economic progression of the nation, and alleviates the challenges faced by an ageing population.On the flip side, working beyond the retirement age may result in adverse health impacts on workers and a decrease in productivity levels. In Japan, the suicide rates have recently been increasing due to rising stress levels at work faced by the ageing population who are pushed to work beyond their optimal capacity. Escalating stress levels from work to various health complications putting a strain on the healthcare system. Hence, working beyond retirement age may worsen the overall welfare of individuals and adversely impact the economy.To sum up, though working beyond retirement age health hazards leading to reduction in productivity levels, it seems to me that the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion, by assessing the capability of individuals and tailoring their jobs to their health profile, firms and companies should actively involve their workers to be productive beyond their retirement age.This essay is an excellent example of IELTS Band 8 writing. The author presents sound arguments making his/her point of view very clear, examples are being used to support the writer’s points and the organisation of information is handled very well. There are some minor inaccuracies, however, they wouldn’t affect the score much in the real test. Well done!;I do not agree with the notion that individuals should refrain from working after reaching retirement age. While retirement is often seen as a well-deserved respite following many years of dedicated work, numerous individuals opt to continue their careers for a variety of reasons.Firstly, extending one's working life can have positive effects on both physical and mental health. Research indicates that remaining mentally engaged through work can help maintain cognitive functions and lower the risk of age-related mental decline. Furthermore, it provides essential social connections, which are crucial for emotional well-being. Many find that their professional roles give them a sense of purpose that can be hard to replicate in retirement.Secondly, continuing to work past retirement can offer significant financial benefits. As living costs rise and life expectancy increases, many individuals may lack adequate savings to sustain themselves through retirement. Ongoing employment can serve as a vital source of income, enabling individuals to uphold their quality of life and engage in their passions without financial burdens.Finally, working beyond retirement contributes positively to the economy and society at large. Seasoned professionals possess valuable knowledge and skills that can be passed on to younger generations, ensuring that important expertise is preserved. Additionally, many retirees choose to work in sectors that benefit society, such as education, healthcare, or non-profit organizations, thus making a meaningful contribution to their communities.In summary, individuals should have the autonomy to decide whether they want to continue working after retirement age. Given the potential advantages for health, financial security, and societal impact, extending one’s work life can be a rewarding experience for many. Ultimately, the choice to work beyond retirement should be guided by personal circumstances and preferences rather than dictated by an arbitrary age limit.
709;People think that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. Others believe that there are other alternative solutions for reducing crime.Discuss both views and give your opinion on this topic.;"Nowadays the sentences that judges give to criminals is always at the centre of attention of the society; some people think that the best way to reduce the amount of crime cases is to give longer prison sentences, while, others say that there are other alternative ways to stop it. This essay will talk about both views and, at the end, I will give my opinion about the argument.It is always more common to see long sentences for criminals, also if their crimes are not too bad to deserve that type of punishment; the reason why the court gives to them long sentences is because they think that staying a lot in prison will make the criminals understand that what they did is wrong and, next time, they will think twice before doing something bad or against the law.However long sentences can go against the human rights because they will take away from prisoners years of their life; for this reason, some people think that it can be better if, instead of stay close in a jail without doing nothing, they can be used in various works that will make them useful for the society and better person at the end of the sentence, like cleaning the city, helping old people in retirement homes and also cook for poor people.I think that there are other ways to stop crime instead of giving long punishments, also because everyone should have a second chance in their life and, more importantly, teach and show to prisoners different aspects of the community will help cities to become better places with less crimes to stop.This essay talked about two different types of views about crime sentences in our society, with my own opinion about the argument in the last part of it.";The challenge of reducing crime is intricate and multi-dimensional, with a range of proposed solutions. One viewpoint suggests that imposing longer prison sentences serves as an effective means of deterrence and punishment. Advocates of this perspective maintain that stricter penalties will discourage potential offenders due to fear of severe consequences. Additionally, they argue that extended prison terms provide a sense of justice and retribution for victims.Conversely, others contend that alternative approaches may yield better results in crime reduction. These alternatives might encompass rehabilitation programs, community service, and tackling the root causes of crime such as poverty, unemployment, and social inequality. This perspective emphasizes the importance of preventing crime before it occurs, rather than merely punishing offenders post-incident. It acknowledges that crime often stems from deeper societal issues and that addressing these underlying factors can lead to more sustainable crime reduction.In my view, although longer prison sentences can offer a sense of justice and act as a deterrent, I believe that alternative strategies are more effective in combating crime. By focusing on the underlying causes and providing support and rehabilitation for offenders, we can work towards building a safer and more equitable society. Furthermore, this humane approach tends to be more cost-effective over time, as it can help lower recidivism rates and prevent future crimes. For these reasons, I advocate for prioritizing alternative solutions in the pursuit of crime reduction.
1286;People today find their lives more and more dominated by their jobs. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is certainly true that many people around the world find their lives dominated by the work that they have to do. This is shown when you realise how people’s work, and how much time, effort and resources they devote to it, is often the subject of conversation.Most people depend on their jobs to generate an income to pay for their lives’ necessities and luxuries, and so work can naturally become a dominating focus. As this is an important part of nearly everyone’s everyday life, it can seem that people’s lives are indeed becoming more influenced by their jobs. Whether this emphasis on work is more significant now than in previous years is debatable. In many developed countries around the world, there are procedures in place to help people with finding work, providing unemployment benefits, ensuring education, and offering pension payments. In times past, these provisions were not in place and a job or business was required to provide the necessary income.Therefore, in spite of increases in the cost of living in many places around the world, it can be argued there is actually less pressure than in previous years to keep one’s job and perform well at it. This, in turn, would lead to people’s lives being less influenced by their jobs today. It is also true that in the past, people were as responsible and focused on doing well in their responsibilities as today and so, in this respect, the people of the past would be equally dedicated to their work as people are today.While I agree that people’s lives today are often dominated by their jobs, I feel that the current situation is not necessarily worse than before. In fact, it may be more positive, due to the fewer pressures to earn money in many countries.;"The idea that work is increasingly taking over people's lives is a widespread concern in today's society. I largely resonate with this view, as many individuals dedicate a considerable amount of their time and energy to their careers, often to the detriment of their personal lives.One key reason behind this trend is the growing demands of the modern workplace. With technological advancements, employees are frequently expected to remain connected and available, which blurs the boundaries between their professional and personal lives. For instance, many workers find themselves checking emails and responding to messages beyond regular hours, thereby extending the workday into their free time. This constant connectivity can encroach upon personal time, as individuals feel a continuous pressure to be ""on duty.""Another contributing factor is the rising pressure to sustain a certain lifestyle. As living costs increase, many feel the need to work longer hours or take on extra jobs to make ends meet. Consequently, work often becomes the focal point of their lives, while personal relationships, hobbies, and interests are sidelined. For example, a friend of mine manages multiple jobs to support her family, which leaves her with little time for leisure or social activities.However, it's important to acknowledge that some individuals successfully maintain a healthy work-life balance, preventing their jobs from overshadowing their lives. These individuals typically prioritize self-care, establish clear boundaries between work and personal time, and carve out time for the activities and relationships that bring them happiness and satisfaction. Ultimately, while many struggle with work dominating their lives, it is indeed possible to resist this trend and nurture a more balanced and fulfilling lifestyle."
1264;Percentage of UK people who consumed daily recommended amount of fruit and vegetable in 2002, 2006 and 2010.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar graph compares the proportion of UK citizens in terms of their consumption of daily recommended portions of fruits and vegetables in three different years which are 2002, 2006, and 2010.Overall, females consumed the highest percentage of their recommended healthy food, followed by males, and last are the children.additionally the year 2006 had witnessed the vastest consumption of vegetables and fruits among all given years.Women ate exactly 25% of the daily adviced dose of natural food in the year 2002, 32% in 2006, and 26% in 2010, however men took 22% of the recommended dose in the year 2002, 26% in 2006, and 24% in 2010.On the other hand younger individuals only consumed 11%, 18%, and 16% of the daily requirements of veggies and fruits in the years 2002, 2006, and 2010 respectively. It appears that residents of the UK had eaten the highest daily requirements of greens and fruits in the year 2006 as compared to the years 2006 and 2010.;The available data presents an interesting look at the percentage of people in the UK who consumed the recommended daily amount of fruits and vegetables in 2002, 2006, and 2010. In 2002, around 22% of men and 28% of women met the daily intake guidelines. However, by 2006, these figures had slightly declined to 20% for men and 25% for women. This downward trend continued into 2010, with the percentages falling further to 18% for men and 22% for women.A key aspect of this data is the steady decrease in the percentage of individuals adhering to the recommended daily intake of fruits and vegetables over the eight-year period. This trend is evident in both genders, pointing to a worrying decline in healthy eating practices among the UK population.When examining the changes over the years, it is clear that the decline has been more significant among males, who experienced a 4% drop from 2002 to 2010. In contrast, females saw a 6% decrease during the same timeframe. Notably, women consistently reported higher percentages of meeting the daily intake recommendations compared to men in all three years.The reduction in fruit and vegetable consumption among the UK population raises public health concerns, as a diet rich in these foods is vital for sustaining good health and preventing chronic illnesses. This data underscores the necessity for targeted initiatives and awareness campaigns aimed at promoting healthier eating habits and increasing fruit and vegetable intake, especially among men. Overall, it indicates that more efforts are needed to support the UK population in achieving the recommended daily consumption of fruits and vegetables.
1402;Popular events like the football world cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The World Cup football and the Olympics are held worldwide with great national support and expectations. As a fan of those competitions, I agree with the idea that sporting events can be necessary for international relations and national unity, but only partially, because such events can have unintended effects on relationships between countries.First of all, the World Cup, Olympics and other international games work for easing tensions among different nations. For example, South and North Korea have football games regularly two nations a chance to understand each other . In the mid of North Korean supporters came to South Korea with the footballers and they were very excited during the sporting events. Even if it sounds ridiculous, many South Koreans were quite surprised at that moment when North Koreans shouted and cried during the match. We all realized that they were very normal sports fans even though they were occasionally very secretive. Through the sports, two divided nations could reduce their political and ideological tensions and could feel the patriotic unity.On the other hand, some sports matches can make international relations worse. For instance, football or baseball games between Korea and Japan are always big matches in two countries where . Sometimes, after the matches, the two rivals blame each other and their patriotic emotions explode in an aggressive way. scenario is that the troubles caused by losing games affect the players directly.;The assertion that major events such as the football World Cup and other international sports competitions play a crucial role in alleviating global tensions and allowing for the release of patriotic sentiments in a safe manner is a subject of ongoing discussion. While I acknowledge that these events can positively influence international relations, I contend that their significance is often overstated. On one hand, these competitions can unite individuals and create opportunities for nations to engage in friendly rivalry, potentially reducing tensions and encouraging diplomatic dialogue. The Olympic Games, for instance, have a storied tradition of fostering unity and peaceful interactions among countries. Additionally, the thrill and enthusiasm that international sport evokes can serve as a constructive outlet for national pride, enabling supporters to celebrate their countries without falling into violence or animosity. On the other hand, it is important to understand that the effects of these events on global tensions can be fleeting and superficial. The fundamental conflicts and political discrepancies between nations remain largely unaddressed during these occasions. Moreover, the heightened competition and nationalism that can surface during these events may, at times, intensify tensions and deepen existing divides. For instance, intense rivalries between national football teams have led to violent confrontations among fans. Nonetheless, the overall positive impact of international sporting events in fostering global unity and offering a forum for nations to connect through friendship and fair play should not be overlooked.In conclusion, while I believe that international sporting events can contribute to easing tensions and provide a constructive outlet for patriotism, it is essential not to overemphasize their importance, and to recognize their limitations.
913;Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:In the past, sporting champions used to be motivated primarily by the desire to win a match or to break world records. These days they are more likely to be motivated by prize money and the opportunity to be famous.What message does this send to young people and how does this attitude to sport affect the sports themselves?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;There were many sport competitions organized after the World-War II since the first Olympic games was held in Athena, in 1963, to bring the world together again. Previously, sport competition was seen as an opportunity for the athletes to break the world records for the pride of their home countries. However, nowadays, people are more inclined to win the match because of money reward and glory. I believe that young people should be more encouraged to achieve their goals to become a champion so that the value of sport competition would not be purely for commercial purpose.In the last decades, there have been a lot of sport competitions being held from national to global level. The athletes were trained by the supported teams to do their best to become the world champion. It was the pride of such athlete to win and see their national flags were rised after the match. Over the years, sport has become more commercial following its popularity to attract global audiences. Many athletes are paying more attention for the opportunity to win the match for commercial purpose. For example, one wants to become a famous soccer player so that they could become the ambassador of Adidas and get more income out of it.Due to the temptation for getting famous and having more money, there are people who choose to play unfairly during a competition. Instead of focusing on increasing their skills, they would cheat to win the game for money. For example, a soccer player may use thyroid injection for boosting their energy level even though it is strictly prohibited. Moreover, sport is not seen anymore to promote peace and solidarity among people from different cultural backgrounds but for the chance to get the superficial gloriness.To conclude, even if the motivation has shifted, the young people should learn to focus more on becoming a real champion and play fairly so that they can become the best athletes in thier expertise while the money and glory would follow them after.;The sports landscape has experienced a profound change over the years. In earlier times, athletes were fueled by a sincere love for their sport, a drive to win, and the aspiration to set world records. Today, however, many champions appear to be more motivated by financial rewards and the quest for fame. This shift raises troubling implications for youth and significantly affects the integrity of sports.The emphasis on money and celebrity can lead young athletes to prioritize financial success and public recognition over core values like teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. This trend risks creating a generation that values personal gain more than the joy of competition and the pursuit of excellence. A notable example is the recent pattern of young footballers choosing lucrative sponsorship deals over honing their skills on the field, illustrating this troubling shift.Furthermore, the focus on monetary rewards and fame can have detrimental effects on sports themselves. Growing commercialization may lead to a homogenization of athletic styles, emphasizing entertainment over genuine skill. The rise of scripted reality shows and sensational media coverage exacerbates this issue, fostering a culture that prioritizes drama and controversy over authentic sporting accomplishments. Recent scandals, such as the controversies surrounding the sale of votes for the FIFA Ballon d'Or, highlight the risks associated with financial interests overshadowing the essence of sports.In summary, the evolution of motivation from the desire to win and break records to the pursuit of money and fame sends a disheartening message to young people and significantly influences the world of sports. It is crucial to rediscover and uphold the true values of sportsmanship, encouraging a culture that celebrates athleticism, teamwork, and fair play over financial success and celebrity allure.
903;Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:Some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by giving them extra money. This practice can act as an incentive for some but may also have a negative impact on others.To what extent is this style of management effective?Are there better ways of encouraging employees to work hard?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Running a company and controlling their staff is a big responsibility for employers . In general, employers should have a great vision about the future of their own company and how to improve it in a better way .To start with, some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by simply giving them more many. In addition, that practice can act as a good source of motivation, you can see that your hard work and your extra hours wasn't waste after all .On the other hand, this style of management may affect tha company and their community in a negative way . For example, the manager of the institution may be more focused on just one employee who's always have the extra credit for the work therefore the other employees work hard for nothing and that leave a bad idea that they clearly work for just having that extra money and rewards from the manager .Beside that, employees will be affected and their productivity will change and drop even more and all of that is a result on how the management of a company impact their work and their effort of doing more .To sum it up, all the members in that company worked so hard, a little credit for their effort and long hours of developing their company and rewards them for it won't do any harm . Not to mention, a manager can reward the staff of the institution by giving them a day or two off or basically a three hours break . Anything that make them really satisfied after their long and efficient work towards the developing of the company.;Rewarding outstanding employees with additional financial compensation has long been a strategy used by management to enhance productivity and motivation. On one hand, bonuses can serve as a strong incentive for many individuals, providing tangible acknowledgment of their hard work and commitment. For example, a sales team that achieves or surpasses its quarterly objectives may be awarded a bonus, which motivates them to continue striving for similar successes in the future. This tactic can effectively drive short-term outcomes and cultivate a competitive atmosphere in the workplace.On the other hand, this management approach may negatively affect some employees, potentially causing resentment and demotivation among those who do not receive bonuses. If the criteria for earning these rewards lack transparency or fairness, it can lead to feelings of inequality and dissatisfaction. Moreover, placing too much emphasis on financial incentives can promote an overly competitive and individualistic company culture, which may detract from teamwork and collaboration.A more effective strategy for motivating employees might involve a blend of financial and non-financial rewards, such as opportunities for personal and professional growth, public recognition, and a healthy work-life balance. For instance, companies like Google provide their employees with perks such as flexible working hours, on-site childcare, and access to professional development opportunities, which can enhance a sense of belonging, motivation, and job satisfaction. By taking a more comprehensive approach to employee motivation, employers can foster a more positive and productive work environment, where employees feel valued and supported beyond financial incentives. Ultimately, a balanced and fair management strategy is essential for ensuring that all employees feel motivated and encouraged to contribute to the company's success.
897;Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime.Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In the UK and Australia, a jury is not provided with the defendant's previous criminal history. Some law representatives claim that this should be reverted, and the jury must be provided with this information beforehand. I fully agree with this statement since the jury will have a better understanding of the defendant's behaviour, and the final decision will be easier to understand for the audience.Having the jury the right access to the defendant's past criminal background, would provide the jury with enough information about the defendant's behaviour. This is because there are certain previous criminal behavioural patterns which allow a better profesional decision-making from the part of the jury. For example, a recent study of the Law's Practice of Melboune, has shown that around 77% of people who commit a crime, were involved in at least one criminal event in the past with similar characteristics to the current crime.On the other hand, if the jury has access to the defendant's past criminal history, it would be easier for the audience to understand the nature of the jury's final decision. This is because there have been cases in which the jury's final decision was not completely accepted by the audience or misunderstood. Therefore, providing the jury with enough criminal backgroud records of the defendant will make it clear to understand in beased of what or why the jury's final decision was made.In conclusion, in the UK and Australia, a jury does not have access to a defendant's previous criminal records, and some law representatives claim that this should be reverted. I fully agree with this statement since being provided with this documents will allow the jury a more understanding of the defendant's behaviour, and the final jury's decision will be easier to understand for the audience.;"The practice in British and Australian law of keeping a defendant's prior criminal record hidden from a jury in criminal trials is a subject of considerable debate. While some attorneys contend that juries should have access to all relevant past information, most legal experts oppose this view. I share the opinion that this practice should remain unchanged.The main reason for concealing a defendant's previous record is to prevent bias and guarantee a fair trial. If jurors are aware of a defendant's past offenses, they may be inclined to unjustly assume the defendant's guilt, irrespective of the evidence specific to the current case. This could result in wrongful convictions and erode the principles of justice. For example, a defendant with a record of theft might be more likely to be convicted of another theft, even if the evidence against them is merely circumstantial.In addition, permitting juries to consider a defendant's history could lead to inconsistent verdicts. Different juries might assign varying levels of significance to prior crimes, resulting in disparate treatment of defendants. Such a scenario would undermine the integrity of the justice system and introduce uncertainty for both defendants and victims.Conversely, the existing system mandates that juries concentrate solely on the evidence pertaining to the current case, free from the influence of a defendant's past. This framework upholds the critical principle of ""innocent until proven guilty"" and facilitates a more impartial evaluation of the evidence. Ultimately, I believe it is crucial to retain the current practice of withholding a defendant's prior record from juries to ensure a fair and equitable legal system."
1308;Professional sportsmen and sportswomen and professional entertainers can often command enormous salaries today and this situation reflects society’s dependence on being entertained.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is no secret that today’s entertainment industry is extremely popular, with nearly everyone being engaged at some time in watching TV shows, movies and sports games. The North American sports industry alone generates a massive $67.7 billion every year. With the present emphasis on entertainment, sportsmen and women and professional entertainers can earn enormous salaries, with figures in the millions for one game, appearance or film. This situation certainly does reflect today’s society’s obsession with entertainment.Many people argue that celebrities do not deserve such payment when work in other professions considered of equal or higher value to society is underpaid. A-list celebrities can make over $20 million per movie, whilst many average workers can barely make ends meet. Of course there are lots of people who say that there are better ways the money could be used, rather than allowing such a vast amount to go to just one person. This is a fairly naive point of view, though. So long as people wish to watch entertainment, advertising in turn will be present and the most watched celebrities will be able to earn high salaries, as their presence will ensure the high viewing figures the advertisers desire.Though celebrities and sportsmen and sportswomen often make very large sums of money, it can also be seen as unfair to say that they do not deserve it or propose their money be used for something else. While it is true that they did not find a cure for cancer or made a life-changing scientific discovery, their hard work and expertise created a product that the public wants to see and the high payment merely reflects their value.In conclusion, it is clear that today’s society is indeed a society obsessed with being entertained and the high salaries paid to those who entertain society clearly reflect this. The high payments, however, are not necessarily out of place or undeserved.;The idea that professional athletes and entertainers can earn astronomical salaries due to society's reliance on entertainment is a widely discussed topic. I largely agree that this statement is accurate. The substantial incomes of celebrities and sports stars illustrate the high value society places on entertainment.On one side, the earnings of professional athletes and entertainers reflect the immense revenue generated by the entertainment industry. For example, elite footballers like Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi rake in tens of millions each year, not only from their clubs but also through lucrative endorsement deals. Similarly, top-tier actors such as Dwayne Johnson and Leonardo DiCaprio receive substantial fees for their film roles. The reason behind this is the vast number of fans willing to pay to watch them, whether on the field or the big screen. The combination of high demand for entertainment and the relatively limited number of exceptionally talented individuals drives these inflated salaries.Conversely, one could argue that such salaries are not entirely warranted and highlight a societal imbalance in values. For instance, essential workers like teachers and nurses, who play a vital role in society’s well-being, often receive modest pay. This discrepancy prompts us to question the true worth we assign to different professions and the influence of celebrity culture on our perceptions of value and success.In conclusion, while I recognize that the entertainment industry does generate substantial revenue and that extraordinary talent deserves appropriate compensation, I am also concerned about the stark contrast between the pay of entertainers and that of crucial professionals. While society's reliance on entertainment is undeniable, it is essential to reevaluate our priorities and ensure that we appropriately value and reward all professions based on their true contributions to society.
1311;Providing a national system in a country where the unemployed receive a regular payment only encourages people not to seek work and puts an unreasonable strain on a country’s financial resources.Discuss this statement and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;In modern day society, money is a driving force for nearly everyone. Most people aspire to be financially secure and to have the ability to live the life they want. However, not everyone is able to find paid employment, and for that reason in some countries around the world, governments have initiated a system where the unemployed receive a regular payment to enable them to survive. Some people believe it is an excellent idea, whilst others believe that it is exhausting a country’s financial resources.When looking at the positive aspects of this system, it can be said that it prevents individuals from having a private bankruptcy. When somebody becomes unemployed, he or she will have on-going costs such as rent for a dwelling, bills for water, telephone and electricity as well as the cost of food and several other things. Without a salary, this person will fall into debt, because they will be unable to cover these expenses. A national unemployment payment system will therefore prevent this person from losing nearly everything over time. Without such system, many people would become homeless and would potentially engage in criminal activities to survive. Therefore, one can say that this system is positive. Although stories are heard of people exploiting the system, usually the newly unemployed want to find a job fast in order to become financially independent again, meaning that the government does not have to support them for long.Although there are positive aspects of this system, one can also say that if the payment made by the government is too high, it will prevent people from looking for work actively. Occasionally, the payment people receive is higher than their potential salaries, deterring them from working and creating an on-going cost for the government. A potential solution for this could be providing free training and employment support to open up new career opportunities with higher income, which would motivate this group to re-enter the workforce.In conclusion, the unemployment benefits system has positive and negative aspects. Personally, I believe that the positive effects of the system outweigh the negative. The payment must remain on a level that helps people survive without regular salaries, but does not seem attractive to exploit over a longer period of time.;The idea that a national system of regular payments for the unemployed can demotivate job-seeking and strain a country's finances is a controversial topic. While some believe that such a system can create dependency and diminish the drive to work, the situation is more nuanced. In my view, a properly structured unemployment benefits system can serve as an essential safety net, aiding individuals during transitions between jobs rather than acting as a disincentive.It is indeed the case that excessively generous unemployment benefits can lessen the urgency to find work. If the payments are too high or extended for too long, they may lead to a culture of dependency, with individuals opting for government support instead of pursuing employment. Critics often highlight the elevated unemployment rates in certain European nations with comprehensive welfare systems as evidence of this phenomenon. However, it's important to understand that the connection between unemployment benefits and labor market participation is complex. Many people encounter considerable obstacles to employment, including skill deficits, limited job opportunities in their region, or health challenges, and during these times, benefits can be a crucial support.Conversely, a well-balanced unemployment benefits framework can actually enhance the job search process by allowing individuals the time needed to find suitable positions instead of hastily accepting any job due to financial pressure. This approach can result in better job placements, increased productivity, and ultimately contribute to a healthier economy. For instance, Denmark's flexicurity model integrates generous unemployment benefits with proactive labor market policies that promote job searching and offer training opportunities. This strategy has been linked to high employment rates and shorter unemployment spells, indicating that, when designed correctly, a national unemployment payment system can bolster rather than obstruct the labor market. Moreover, during economic downturns, unemployment benefits can act as automatic stabilizers, infusing cash into the economy and lessening the impact of recessions.In summary, although there are legitimate worries about the possibility of unemployment benefits discouraging work, a carefully designed system can significantly benefit both individuals and the economy as a whole. Instead of dismantling these systems, nations should concentrate on developing policies that balance support for the unemployed with incentives and resources to facilitate their return to work, ultimately fostering a more resilient and equitable labor market.
1314;Public health is becoming an urgent issue nowadays. Some argue that governments should create nutrition and food choice laws to improve public health, while others believe that it is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Public health has become an increasingly pressing issue in the modern world, with many populations facing rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related diseases. This has led to a debate as to whether governments should establish nutrition and food choice laws for the betterment of public health or if it solely falls on individuals to make wise choices. In my view, everyone should take ownership of their diet and assume responsibility for their health because it is the right choice.The argument for government-imposed nutrition and food choice laws is that they could help prevent people from making unhealthy choices which could lead to more serious illnesses down the line. For example, government regulations could limit the amount of sugar or fats allowed in food products, especially those marketed to children, and impose taxes on unhealthy snacks like chips and candy bars. This approach would also benefit those who lack the knowledge about healthy food, necessary to make informed decisions. By providing clear guidelines on what foods are healthy, and by taxing the unhealthy options higher, the government would steer individuals away from unhealthy options.However, there are also some valid arguments against governmental intervention. These types of regulations infringe upon individuals’ right to choose what they put in their bodies. After all, everyone should be free to make lifestyle choices for themselves. Additionally, there may not be enough evidence to suggest that overly restrictive regulations would have beneficial effects on public health outcomes in the long run. Since people’s love of unhealthy food is often considered an addiction, it is unlikely that a higher price or other warnings would be enough to deter individuals from purchasing unhealthy food items.In conclusion, while there can certainly be benefits associated with implementing nutrition and food choice laws at a governmental level, ultimately it should still come down to personal choice and responsibility as far as one’s diet is concerned. Governments should instead focus on providing citizens with better nutrition education, so that they can make better informed decisions about what they consume. This way, they can receive the information they need while still having autonomy over their own diets and lifestyles.;In recent years, the topic of public health has gained significant attention, leading to debates about the role of government in encouraging healthy eating habits. On one side of the argument, some advocate for the implementation of laws governing nutrition and food choices to enhance public health. This could involve actions like limiting the availability of unhealthy foods and taxing sugary beverages and junk food. Supporters of this approach suggest that such regulations could decrease the prevalence of diet-related health issues, such as obesity and diabetes, resulting in a healthier society overall.Conversely, others argue that dietary choices should remain an individual's prerogative and responsibility. They contend that government intervention infringes on personal freedom, advocating instead for education and awareness initiatives as more effective means to foster healthy eating behaviors. From this perspective, individuals ought to have the autonomy to decide on their diets without government oversight.In my view, while individual responsibility and choice are crucial, governments also have a vital role in promoting public health. They can help create a supportive environment for healthy eating by subsidizing fresh produce and regulating the food industry to limit the aggressive marketing of unhealthy options. By employing a balanced strategy that integrates education, awareness, and regulatory measures, governments can enhance public health while respecting personal freedoms. Ultimately, addressing the complex challenges of public health requires a cooperative approach involving governments, individuals, and the food industry to cultivate a healthier society.
267;Reporting of crimes and other kinds of violent news on television and in newspapers can have adverse consquences. This kind of information should be restricted from being shown in the media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Reporting violent crimes and other violent issues could represents a adverse consequence sometimes. Overall, it is important to enphasyded that people are geting more and more violant and we can't blame only media as a mainly factor for those behavior.This kind of questions is almost a phylosical one and we will keeping this doubt for a long time, or even never now if people are becoming more agressive because they are more expousure to this kind of news, or if we are having more report regarding to violence just because people are getting more violent.I believe that people could feel estimulated to be a criminous person when they have a minimium certain that they won't be punish.For instance, stolen and other minimius crimes had increase at california region after they anounced that stolen under tham $1000 are consider a crime anymore. So the sensation that people could do anything wrong and that is no penalty for that, estimulates the number for stolen.In other hand, when we see some hardly rules the number of crime are dipest low, as we can see at Dubai, for instance. As all penalties are really hard and strongly implemented this place is considering highest safe.I bilieve that restricting any kind of information be showen in the media doesn't solve the problem, and, in fact, bring another new problem related to limited population information. When people know what are happening, type of crimes, etc, they could be prepare to handle with those problems and prevent theirselves.;The coverage of crimes and violent incidents in the media has ignited a significant debate regarding its potential effects on society. While some contend that this type of reporting should be limited, I hold a nuanced perspective on the matter. On one hand, unrestricted broadcasting of violent news can have detrimental psychological effects on viewers, especially on children and those who are more vulnerable. Encountering graphic and distressing content may heighten feelings of fear and anxiety, as well as lead to desensitization toward violence. Additionally, an overemphasis on crime reporting can foster a culture of voyeurism, in which the public is drawn more to the sensational elements of a crime rather than examining the deeper social issues that contribute to such incidents.Conversely, imposing restrictions on the reporting of crimes and violent events could compromise the core tenets of a free press and the public’s right to information. The media plays an essential role in educating citizens about critical issues and holding authorities accountable. By covering crimes and violent events, journalists can shine a light on societal challenges, including crime statistics, police misconduct, or insufficient mental health resources. This exposure can stimulate public discourse, advocacy efforts, and, potentially, positive societal change. Moreover, responsible and well-rounded reporting can amplify the voices of victims and highlight available support services.In summary, while I recognize the possible negative outcomes of crime and violence reporting, I believe that an outright ban is not the answer. Instead, the media should focus on delivering responsible and balanced coverage that avoids sensationalism and graphic portrayals. By adopting this approach, the media can fulfill its obligation to inform the public while minimizing harm, ultimately fostering a more knowledgeable and compassionate society. A balanced method of reporting on crimes and violent news is essential to keep the public informed without inflicting distress.
1;Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Poverty represents a worldwide crisis. It is the ugliest epidemic in a region, which could infect countries in the most debilitating ways. To tackle this issue, rich countries need to help those in need and give a hand when possible. I agree that there are several ways of aiding poor countries other than financial aid, like providing countries in need with engineers, workers, and soldiers who would build infrastructure. Building universities, hospitals, and roadways. By having a solid infrastructure, poor countries would be able to monetise their profits and build a stronger and more profitable economy which would help them in the long term. Once unprivilged countries find their niche, the major hurdle would be passed and would definitely pave the way for much brighter future. However, I do disagree that financial aid does not solve poverty, it does if used properly and efficiently. The most determining factor if financial aid would be the way to go, is by identifying what type of poor countries' representative are dealing with. Some countries will have a responsible leader and some will not, with that being said, implementing a strategy, to distinguish responsible leaders from others, would tailor the type of aid rich countries could use. An example, A clear report and constant observation would be applied to track the progress and how this type of aid is being monetized. In summary, types of aid varies from country to another, and tailoring the type of aid is of paramount importance to solve this problem that had huge toll on poor countries.;"The idea that financial aid from wealthier nations fails to significantly reduce poverty has ignited a discussion about the most effective types of assistance. While some believe developed countries should prioritize alternative forms of aid, I partially concur with this view.On one hand, financial aid can fall short in tackling the underlying causes of poverty. It is often susceptible to mismanagement or misuse by corrupt governments, and may foster a culture of dependency rather than promoting self-reliance. Additionally, non-monetary assistance, such as knowledge transfer, technology, and education, can lead to deeper and more sustainable improvements in a nation's development. For example, implementing training and skill-building programs can empower local communities to stimulate their own economic progress and lessen their dependence on external help.On the other hand, financial aid remains vital in urgent situations or for certain developmental initiatives. During natural disasters or humanitarian emergencies, prompt financial support is essential to save lives and provide essential services. Moreover, strategically allocated financial aid can bolster critical infrastructure development—such as constructing schools, hospitals, or roads—that are fundamental to a nation's long-term growth.In summary, while I support the idea that developed nations should consider offering other forms of assistance, such as technical support and capacity-building programs, either in addition to or in lieu of financial aid, I do not believe we should completely dismiss the value of financial help. A balanced approach that merges financial support with various assistance types—customized to the unique circumstances and needs of each developing nation—will likely yield the most effective outcomes in combating poverty and fostering sustainable development. Ultimately, there is no universal remedy; a sophisticated strategy that embraces diverse forms of aid is essential to making a genuine impact in the battle against poverty."
1381;Schools should select students by their academic abilities, agree or disagree?;Some people think that schools should select students according to their academic abilities, while others believe that it is better to have students with different abilities studying together. Discuss both views and state your own opinion.Some people contend that mixed ability classes are more beneficial for children’s development than streaming them on the basis of judgement about their academic abilities. However, from my perspective, I disagree with this contention.Admittedly, mixed ability classes provide a better environment for children’s all-round development. In such classes, children with different abilities study together and in turn they can learn from one another. From example, a student, who is good at academic study but weak in dancing or painting, can learn how to dance or paint his peers. In this sense, mixed ability classes allow students to develop their abilities in different subjects instead of only academic abilities.Despite the argument above, I believe streaming students brings more benefits to teachers and students. As for teachers, separating children with better academic abilities from others facilitates effective teaching. This practice helps teachers to control their students more conveniently and easily. Compared with mixed ability in which teacher should consider students’ differences when they are using teaching methodologies, streaming makes this situation simpler. To be more specific, students are at the same level of academic ability in a class, and in turn teachers can use the same methodologies for them all. In this way, the narrower the spread of ability in the class, the more convenient the teaching can be.On top of this, enables students to learn in an effective way. According to students’ different abilities, they are taught in different ways that are more suitable for them. In the top streams, students use more difficult materials, therefore, they can learn more. In sharp contrast, teachers can explain the material more slowly to those in bottom streams. Under this circumstance, students with different academic abilities can study effectively and efficiently.In the final analysis, mixed ability classes are beneficial for students’ versatile development, but in my opinion, segregating students based on different academic ability is better for both teachers and students.The writer presented a balanced discussion of the topic, effortlessly delivered in a form of a fluent, well-written IELTS essay. The arguments and reasoning are laid out in a coherent, logical way. A wide range of vocabulary is used in this work. There are very few spelling errors that could have been caught in an additional round of proofreading (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). Keep up the good work! Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;The debate surrounding whether schools should choose students based on their academic skills has been ongoing for quite some time. Proponents argue that such selection can create a more effective learning atmosphere, while opponents believe it can result in social and emotional challenges. Personally, I am opposed to the idea of schools selecting students based on academic prowess.Choosing students based on their academic performance risks fostering a narrow and elitist educational model. This could lead to students who are less academically inclined being assigned to lower-quality schools or programs, which can severely damage their self-esteem and motivation. It may also result in a system where students are confined to specific categories, constraining their potential and growth opportunities.Additionally, selecting students based on their academic abilities can further entrench social inequalities. Students from underprivileged backgrounds often face a lack of access to essential resources and opportunities, placing them at a significant disadvantage in the selection process. Consequently, this can lead to a scenario where students from wealthier families are disproportionately chosen for elite schools, worsening pre-existing social and economic disparities.Instead of focusing on academic selection, the education system should emphasize creating inclusive and supportive learning environments that address the diverse needs of all students. This includes implementing strategies that advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion, such as mixed-ability classrooms and individualized learning plans. By adopting these approaches, schools can offer a more comprehensive education that prepares students for success in all areas of life, not solely in academics. Ultimately, the purpose of education should be to equip students with the skills, knowledge, and support necessary to realize their full potential, irrespective of their academic abilities.
1337;Scientists believe that the world is in danger due to environmental changes. Some people say that personal lifestyle changes should be made to reduce the damage to environment, while others think that the government should do something to help. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Environmental problems are clearly something that is often discussed in today’s world. One part of the society claims that individuals should change their habits and lifestyle to improve the ecological situation. Others, on the other hand, believe that this issue should be solved on the governmental level. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and my perspective will be offered.It is hard to deny that human kind is responsible for the current environmental situation, and it seems impossible to achieve any noticeable result in this field without the participation of vast majority of individuals. For instance, a simple lifestyle change such as introducing the separation of household rubbish can make recycling projects more convenient and efficient. Moreover, consumers can reduce their usage of plastic items and, in turn, less plastic waste will contaminate the environment.However, many people still feel that the government has more tools to prevent environmental changes. One option that the authorities have is to discourage citizens from using personal vehicles by charging high taxes and additional fees. Moreover, politicians usually have access to resources to educate people about environmental problems and promote the most important ecological projects on all levels, ranging from special courses at schools to TV shows and websites related to this topic. Furthermore, it is a key responsibility of the government to protect the environment by spending state funds on research and modern equipment. Countries where legislation protects the ecology, for example Norway, have achieved visible results and overcame most environmental problems.In conclusion, I believe that a combined approach will work best to prevent or reverse environmental changes. A contribution of every individual is just as important as the intervention from the government in order to fix existing issues and save our planet for future generations.;The world is currently grappling with a critical challenge stemming from environmental changes, as highlighted by scientists. The ongoing debate about the most effective strategies for addressing this issue has led to a passionate discussion between those advocating for personal lifestyle changes and those arguing for the necessity of government intervention.Advocates of personal lifestyle changes argue that individual actions can have a meaningful impact on reducing environmental harm. Simple initiatives such as cutting down on plastic usage, utilizing public transportation, and recycling can collectively yield significant benefits when adopted by a broad audience. Additionally, these personal changes can raise awareness and inspire others to join the movement, potentially leading to a grassroots approach to sustainability.Conversely, many contend that government action is essential in tackling environmental challenges. Governments possess the authority to create and enforce policies that can dramatically decrease pollution and waste on a larger scale compared to individual efforts. For example, they can impose stricter regulations on industries, invest in renewable energy sources, and launch comprehensive campaigns to promote sustainable behaviors across the population.I believe that the most effective strategy for addressing environmental changes lies in a blend of personal lifestyle adjustments and government action. While individual efforts can certainly contribute to the solution, they often have limited reach and influence. On the other hand, governmental intervention can establish the necessary infrastructure and resources to confront environmental issues on both national and global levels. Thus, it is vital for individuals to make informed lifestyle choices, while governments must implement and uphold policies aimed at safeguarding our planet for future generations.
1373;Senior managers should have higher salaries than other employees (agree/disagree);In many countries senior positions have higher salaries compared to those of young workers of the same company. Some people think this isn’t justified. Do you agree or disagree?While some believe that rewarding those in managerial positions with higher pay packets is appropriate, not everyone agrees with this view. Personally, I am leaning towards the latter position due to negative impacts caused by significant difference in salaries within a company.For one, executive officers should know that higher than sufficient salaries are not necessary. Indeed, the higher the remuneration they receive, the more likely the company to suffer from devoid of financial capability. Furthermore, they often gain powers that money can’t buy. For instance, they often make important decisions over how to make their company thrive. They are also entitled to allocate company’s budget and designate tasks to other workers. these non-financial entitlements, they should refrain from earning more than reasonable amounts as salaries.Unreasonably high salaries granted to the executives can also afflict other employees. In fact, it is foreseeable that many employees would feel powerless or even when they find out about the huge salary gap between the executive officers’ and theirs. Accordingly, some may leave the company, and others may go on to strike and demand a pay increase. However, those actions . Therefore, unfair salary systems like this would yield unhealthy working environment for both employers and employees.In conclusion, I oppose to those in managerial roles with obscene amounts of compensation because it can cost the company its prosperity and discourage other employees . Thus it is recommended for the company to decide on the salaries of executive officers and general workers by adopting a more motivating salary system.This is a good example of an IELTS Band 8 essay. The task statement is sufficiently discussed, and the writer’s arguments are relevant and well developed. There are only 2 body paragraphs, but they are coherent and help to organise the information. Linking words are used appropriately to sequence ideas. Skillful use of synonyms throughout the essay demonstrates the writer’s vocabulary. Some of the expressions used aren’t entirely suitable or accurate, but there aren’t many of them. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.0.;I believe that senior managers should earn higher salaries than other employees. This is primarily due to the substantial responsibilities they carry within an organization, including making strategic decisions, managing departments, and driving business growth. Their roles usually demand a high level of expertise, strong leadership skills, and the ability to navigate complex and high-pressure situations.One key reason for senior managers’ higher salaries is their significant impact on the organization's success. Their decisions and leadership play a crucial role in influencing the company’s profitability, growth, and competitive stance in the marketplace. Therefore, their compensation should reflect the value they contribute to the organization. Offering higher salaries can also incentivize senior managers to perform at their best, encouraging them to make choices that align with the company’s long-term objectives.Additionally, senior managers often hold advanced degrees and possess extensive experience, which require significant time and financial investment to attain. Their elevated salaries recognize this investment and are essential for attracting and retaining top talent in executive roles, particularly given the competitive nature of the job market for senior management positions.Moreover, a salary hierarchy within a company is a conventional and rational structure that acknowledges varying levels of responsibility and contribution. Junior employees benefit from the guidance and support of their senior counterparts, and as they advance in their careers and take on increased responsibilities, their compensation should also rise accordingly. This system not only motivates employees to aspire for higher positions but also fosters a sense of fairness and progression within the organization.In summary, due to their substantial responsibilities, the requirement for advanced skills and experience, and the need to accurately reflect the value they bring to the organization, senior managers should indeed receive higher salaries than other employees. This not only serves as motivation and recognition but also is an essential part of the organizational structure that aligns rewards with responsibilities and performance.
1357;Should employers pay more attention to personal qualities rather than qualifications?;"While recruiting a new employee, the employer should pay more attention to their personal qualities, rather than qualifications and experience. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and include relevant examples.Recent decades have witnessed a burgeoning growth of numerous industries; therefore, recruiting the right person for the position is crucial to the development of enterprises. But how do we determine if a person is the best fit? Advocates of conventional recruitment methods opine that this candidate must have sufficient experience and qualifications needed for that job. Nevertheless, some people argue that candidates’ personal qualities cannot be ignored. In my view, both components are of equal importance.To begin with, the conventional approach of checking potential workers’ qualifications via their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, issued qualifications and certifications from authorised organisations is vital. Apparently, whenever we submit a job application, we are always required to attach a CV while a cover letter is optional. Without a decent qualification, even if that candidate’s personal characteristics are suitable, the enterprise will need to carry out lots of skill trainings eventually.On the other hand, occasionally during an interview some HR officers ignore the significance of assessing how candidates’ individual qualities can fit in the company. Employers should assess not only candidates’ qualifications but also their enabling skills, ethics and value propositions. The more an employee’s personal qualities fit in a company’s culture and values, the more he or she is motivated to contribute to that company’s vision. KPMG is a great example of evaluating candidates’ personal qualifications and skills by utilising a game-based assessment process, followed by a video interview. This methodology enables a comprehensive assessment, and is embraced by many companies nowadays.To summarise, employers should assess both personal characteristics and formal qualifications when recruiting people as each of these elements has its own vital contribution to make in talent-seeking enterprises.This response covers the topic well. The writer’s position is clearly expressed and supported by an example, the use of paragraphing makes this essay organised and easy to follow. Linking words are used appropriately. The use of complex sentences and advanced vocabulary is impressive. Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.";The discussion around whether employers should emphasize personal attributes over formal qualifications has gained considerable traction in recent years. While qualifications are frequently regarded as a vital measure of a candidate's potential to succeed in a role, there's a growing argument that personal traits such as teamwork, communication skills, and adaptability hold equal or even greater significance.Qualifications offer a glimpse into a candidate’s academic and technical prowess, but they often fall short of capturing their personality, work ethic, or collaborative abilities. A highly qualified candidate might find it challenging to work well in a team or convey complex ideas to colleagues and clients. Conversely, an individual with strong personal attributes—such as empathy, resilience, and a positive outlook—might excel in learning and adapting, despite lacking formal qualifications.Moreover, placing a greater emphasis on personal qualities can contribute to a more diverse and inclusive workforce. By broadening their criteria beyond qualifications, employers can attract candidates from unconventional backgrounds, who can introduce unique perspectives and experiences to the organization. This can drive innovation, creativity, and effective problem-solving, ultimately leading to better business outcomes.In summary, while qualifications are undeniably important, employers should focus more on personal qualities when making hiring decisions. This approach enables the formation of a team that is not only skilled and knowledgeable but also motivated, adaptable, and capable of collaborating seamlessly. Such a strategy can enhance job satisfaction, lower turnover rates, and boost productivity, benefiting both employers and employees alike. It is time for employers to reassess their hiring practices and prioritize those personal traits that truly distinguish a candidate.
1385;Should people spend a lot on weddings and birthday parties?;"Some people think that spending a lot on holding wedding parties, birthday parties and other celebrations is just a waste of money. Others, however, think that these are necessary for individuals and the society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Throwing parties can be expensive. While some people do not find these fancy gatherings worth what they cost, others believe such events are important to both individuals and the society.People choose to throw parties for a number of reasons. For starters, they can make better teams. Project kick-off parties are good opportunities to break the ice and help team members to know each other better. Celebrating a victory create a sense of success and belonging. Companies do not see parties as of money and allocate budget to support such events; moreover, they often leave good memories. From our own experiences, we all have happy memories of our birthday parties when we were little. Every family has great photos at family gatherings in their album. In addition, contrary to what some people believe that spending on parties is a waste of social resources, they actually create value, either by employing people in the party-planning business or by offering people better experiences.The popularity of parties, however, causes some tension in the society. They are hard on introverted people who find themselves uncomfortable in the crowd. This is a clinic symptom which psychologists call “social anxiety disorder”. There are other ways to celebrate important events that may have greater value for their cost. For instance, companies could send out gifts after successful projects and parents could take their children on family trips to celebrate birthdays.In my opinion, while a party is a form of social event that brings many benefits to individuals and the society, other choices should also be considered, either to cut spending or to relieve the stress of those who are not fond of crowded celebrations.This is a very good essay. Other than minor inaccuracies there are no problems (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). Seems to be worth IELTS Band 8.";The debate surrounding the expenditure on weddings and birthday parties is complex. Some contend that these significant milestones are unique events warranting extravagant celebrations. A lavish wedding or birthday bash can forge enduring memories for the individual and their guests, and it also serves as a way to express love, respect, and appreciation for the person being honored. In various cultures, opulent weddings and birthdays are seen as indicators of social status, leading many to feel compelled to invest heavily to uphold their societal image.Conversely, there are those who believe that spending excessively on such celebrations is not only unnecessary but also wasteful. The funds allocated for these occasions might be better spent on more practical matters like saving for the future, paying off debts, or contributing to charitable causes. Moreover, extravagant celebrations can place financial burdens on the hosts, resulting in stress and debt that can have lasting repercussions. The societal pressure to lavish money on these events can lead to anxiety, detracting from the genuine enjoyment and meaning of the celebration.In summary, while the desire to celebrate special moments beautifully is understandable, it is essential to approach the decision to spend significantly on weddings and birthday parties with a careful evaluation of one’s financial circumstances and priorities. A more balanced approach might involve marking these occasions in a way that is both meaningful and enjoyable while remaining responsible and sustainable. This could mean establishing a realistic budget, prioritizing what truly matters, and emphasizing the joy and love of the celebration over the monetary aspects.
1393;Should the same laws which prohibit the sale and consumption of heroin be applied to tobacco? Discuss.;Recently, a heated debate when a few reputable health organizations suggested the application of a similar act of heroin selling and usage prohibition . In this , I will analyze why the adoption of such a law could be a breakthrough in our youngsters’ safety, according to my vision.Firstly, tobacco does not differ much from heroin when it comes to the addictive effect. , the active ingredient in tobacco, exerts its effect by acting directly on smoker’s brain cells. Numerous experiments carried out by on animals, rats, proved that this toxic chemical does lead time to dependency, similarly to the effect experienced with .Secondly, the restriction on selling would surely show an instant decline in tobacco smoking. ” Having easy access to cigarettes puts a tremendous pressure, especially on teenagers,to resist such a temptation” Dr.Hisham , head of department at Alexandria Medical college , states firmly. “Giving the new generation the sense that the severity of smoking is to other lethal drugs usage be a life saving step, they will thank us for as they get older.” he continues.To recapitulate, applying of a futuristic law such as the suggested one will have a positive impact ,not only on young people’s health but on our society as a whole.;The issue of applying laws that ban the sale and use of heroin to tobacco is complex and contentious. On one side, both heroin and tobacco are substances that carry significant health risks. Tobacco is particularly notorious, causing millions of deaths every year worldwide due to smoking-related diseases such as lung cancer and heart disease. This raises the argument that the strict regulations applied to heroin should also extend to tobacco in order to safeguard public health.However, there are notable differences between heroin and tobacco that complicate direct comparisons. Heroin is an illegal drug with no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse, resulting in addiction and serious social issues. Conversely, tobacco, while highly addictive and harmful, has been legally consumed for centuries, supported by a well-established industry. Enacting the same laws for tobacco as are used for heroin would necessitate a dramatic shift in societal and legal perceptions of tobacco, essentially criminalizing a behavior that, albeit unhealthy, is deeply embedded in many cultures.Moreover, a uniform application of heroin laws to tobacco could inadvertently create problems, such as a black market for tobacco similar to that of heroin. This might lead to increased criminal activity, the sale of less safe products, and a reduction in regulation and taxation that currently supports public health programs.In summary, although the health risks linked to tobacco justify stringent regulations, mirroring the laws that ban heroin sales and consumption might not be the most effective or feasible solution. A more thoughtful approach that emphasizes strict regulation, public education, and support for cessation may better achieve the dual goals of protecting public health and addressing the complexities surrounding tobacco use without resorting to over-criminalization.
1394;Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth with poorer nations by providing them with things such as food and education? Or is this the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens?;I think that wealthy nations should be required to share their wealth with poorer nations. at providing such things as food and education because of the three following reasons.Firstly, citizens of both wealthy nations and poorer nations are human beings. Therefore, we can not look at, hear of, or talk about people who lack food, education, without compassion and sympathy. Sharing wealth with poorer nations is not only a good deed but is also a .Secondly, many nations in Africa and Asia are poor. Famine, diseases, crime and illiteracy are killing the citizens of these countries. , many nations in Europe and America are rich. If there are no actions taken, this inequality will increase dramatically. Poor countries will become poorer while rich countries will become richer. As a result, the poorest countries will become slaves of the richest countries. So, sharing wealth is useful way to prevent people from that bad future.Thirdly, although sharing wealth with poorer nations is very necessarythis help should only stop at providing such things as food, medicine and education. Or else, poor nations may become dependent on the aid. They may lose enthusiasm to build their countries by themselves. Moreover, rich nations can take advantage of sharing wealth to interfere with the governance of poor nations’. This can’t be considered a humane action and should be prevented.In my opinion, sharing wealth with poorer nations has both a bad side and a good side. What we have to do is its bad side and its good side.;The discussion around whether affluent countries should share their wealth with less fortunate nations has been ongoing for quite some time. Proponents of wealth redistribution argue that richer nations hold a moral responsibility to assist poorer ones, given their greater resources. By providing food and education, they can help mitigate poverty and enhance living standards, which in turn fosters global stability and prosperity. Wealthy countries can feasibly allocate a portion of their resources to support development initiatives and humanitarian efforts in poorer regions.Conversely, some contend that the main duty of ensuring well-being lies with the governments of poorer nations. These governments, having a deep understanding of their unique needs and challenges, are ideally positioned to implement effective solutions. While external aid may have good intentions, it can inadvertently lead to dependency instead of self-sufficiency. Additionally, the success of such aid is frequently impeded by corruption, bureaucratic delays, and inadequate infrastructure in the recipient countries.A more balanced approach may serve as the most effective solution. Wealthy nations can offer targeted support, such as building capacities, transferring technology, and providing policy advice, to empower poorer nations to develop their own resources and capabilities. This respects the autonomy and self-determination of poorer countries while still addressing their urgent needs. Ultimately, fostering a partnership that combines domestic efforts from poorer nations with external assistance from richer ones is likely to produce the most sustainable and fair outcomes. By collaborating, the global community can make meaningful progress in reducing poverty and inequality, paving the way for a more just and prosperous world for everyone.
1302;Social media has become a real problem for some young people today, and governments should create laws that allow only people over 18 years of age to have accounts.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Social media today is extremely significant to a majority of the population, especially the younger generation. Many teenagers find it exceptionally convenient and necessary for communication and entertainment. However, not everyone is able to use social media responsibly, which gave rise to the idea of making it accessible to only those older than eighteen years of age.Though there are negatives, such as cyber-bullying, or being too distracted by these modern media, there are issues surrounding most things in life. It is a choice to go onto a social media website, and many younger people are capable of managing accounts without any difficulties. It is not the government’s responsibility to monitor under eighteen-year olds; that is for the parents.Statistics show that over eighty per cent of teens use a form of online social media. It allows them to chat online, easily stay in contact with friends and family across the world, and see updates on others’ lives (through text, photos or videos). Social media is a way to express thoughts or ideas and to stay in contact with the rest of the world.To not permit one of the largest Internet-using demographics to use social media because a few people have problems with it is an irrational and an unfair restriction. Not only would profit be lost with fewer users, but controlling who creates accounts and monitoring proof of age would be difficult as well. I believe that laws should not make social media inaccessible to young people under eighteen; this would be unnecessary and absurd.";The idea that social media poses a significant problem for today's youth is a critical issue that deserves careful consideration. The suggestion that governments should enforce laws limiting social media account ownership to those over 18 has merit, but I have reservations about its effectiveness.On one hand, it is clear that excessive use of social media can negatively affect minors, contributing to issues like cyberbullying, shortened attention spans, and exposure to unsuitable content. For example, a study from the Royal Society for Public Health indicates that social media use correlates with heightened feelings of loneliness, sadness, and anxiety among young people. Implementing age restrictions could help address these concerns.However, I contend that a blanket prohibition on social media for those under 18 is neither practical nor effective. Many young individuals use social media in a responsible manner, leveraging it to connect with friends, access educational materials, and engage in communities that foster creativity and self-expression. Additionally, enforcing such laws could prove challenging, as minors might easily bypass age restrictions by providing false information or using their parents' accounts.Rather than imposing age limits, I suggest that governments and social media platforms collaborate to cultivate a safer online environment for young users. This could include implementing rigorous age verification procedures, improving online safety features, and advancing digital literacy initiatives aimed at minors. Moreover, parents and educators should be more actively involved in guiding young people toward responsible social media use and good online etiquette. By adopting a holistic approach, we can reduce the adverse effects of social media on youth without resorting to overly restrictive measures.
771;Society is based on rules and laws. If individuals were free to do whatever they want to do, it could not function. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?;It is commonly held that society can operate perfectly by a set of rules. It means that providing total freedom to people undoubtedly results in chaos with the further possibility of total collapse. I strongly agree with this point of view as I am in the opinion that rules play a significant role in creating a stable society. In this essay, this idea will be discussed in detail.Basically, a set of rules can be helpful to achieve productive results in such essential areas as medicine and construction. For example, it is necessary to develop common procedures of operations in surgery or traffic rules for public transport. Unless there are not standardized, it might cause a lot of deaths or at least injuries. Constructing also should be based on common processes because comfort and safe accommodation is a necessity for many people. Although there are people who consider rules and laws limiting and imposing, it can be argued that they are critical in the organization of humanity.Laws are not obstacles on the way to people's freedom because they are established to regulate formal relationships when it is difficult to find a compromise informally. Moreover, they are vitally important when people face crime and violence. Without any system of justice solving crimes becomes more challenging. All criminal accidents tend to be out of control and spread around the world immediately. Shoplifting, robbery, and even disastrous wars can plunge our world into darkness. This way humanity might face total chaos where morals values and behavioral patterns are neglected. In this context, the word ‘society’ risks becoming totally meaningless, as its main definition is a 'group of people with common traditions and rules.'From the arguments presented above, one may conclude that any society needs standards, laws, or even moral principles. They form a foundation for safety, a good level of medicine, and science that allows to create a strong society and manage any difficulties or threats that may disturb people’s well-being.;The idea that society relies on rules and laws, with individual freedom potentially threatening its stability, is a topic of significant discussion. While I acknowledge that rules and laws are crucial for ensuring social order, I contend that individuals should have the liberty to make their own decisions.On one side, rules and laws establish a framework for social interactions, ensuring that individuals honor the rights and freedoms of others. In the absence of laws, a society would likely descend into chaos, as people could act solely on their impulses without facing repercussions. For instance, laws against theft and violence safeguard citizens' property and enhance their safety, allowing them to enjoy a secure and stable life.Conversely, individual freedom is vital for personal development, creativity, and innovation. Without the ability to choose freely, societies would stagnate and hinder progress. History demonstrates that many crucial advancements and breakthroughs originated with individuals who defied established norms and regulations. Additionally, individual freedom empowers people to express themselves, follow their passions, and enrich the diverse fabric of society.In summary, while rules and laws are indispensable for maintaining social order, I believe individual freedom is equally crucial for the growth and success of society. Striking a balance between the two is essential, where individuals can freely make choices while also respecting the rights and freedoms of others. Achieving this balance allows societies to promote creativity, innovation, and progress while ensuring the stability and security that rules and laws offer. A society that prioritizes both individual freedom and social responsibility is most likely to prosper.
1352;Some believe the government should take care of retirees, while others think everyone should save for their own retirement (opinion);Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.It is true that when people advance into their golden years, they require more help and attention. For that reason, a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly. However, I tend to agree with those who argue that workers should be saving a portion of their income to have a nest egg in their retirement.To begin with, a culture of saving rather than depending on the government may foster the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government. As a result, the government would be able to release more funds to more productive purposes, such as development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which may expedite the overall progression of a country.In addition to economic factors, putting money aside has some personal benefits. Since savings-oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses, this may instill a sense of self-respect and pride in them. On the other hand, those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma, as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society. Hence, to live a life with dignity and pride, taking responsibility for funding one’s own retirement is evidently a better option from individual perspective.In contrast, the provision of monetary outlays for retirees has proven unfeasible in many countries. Since in many nations the number of senior citizens is on the rise, in the long run governments are likely to struggle to sustain the cost of providing for the elderly. The early signs of this have been seen in many countries that were forced to raise the retirement age, including my home country where men can now retire at the age of 67 instead of 65. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, these kinds of support may become completely unsustainable.In conclusion, the provision of state monetary support may undoubtedly lessen the concern of retirees to some extent. However, considering the issue of sustainability of this provision, it is better to opt for individual savings from the very beginning of working life, for the benefit of both individual and national development.This response addresses all parts of the topic, by discussing the merits of funding one’s own retirement versus relying on government pension. The writer’s opinion has been stated as well and is very clear. The neat presentation of ideas has been helped by appropriate paragraphing, and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay. The author’s vocabulary seems to be rich and there is a variety of sentence structures used in this essay. Overall, this essay deserves an IELTS Band 8.;The conversation about retirement care has ignited vigorous debate, with some advocating for governmental responsibility for retirees, while others contend that individuals should take full ownership of their retirement savings. I believe that the latter viewpoint is more pragmatic and sustainable over time.Supporters of government-funded retirement care assert that it is a fundamental human right and that the government has a moral duty to support its aging population. Nevertheless, this model can impose a heavy financial strain on the government, possibly necessitating higher taxes or the diversion of funds from other vital public services. Additionally, the growing life expectancy and the increasing number of retirees can complicate the ability of governments to sustain such a system without accruing substantial debt.Conversely, encouraging people to save for their own retirement fosters personal accountability and financial understanding. This enables individuals to make well-informed choices regarding their retirement plans, such as investing in pension schemes or other saving vehicles, which allows them to secure their futures without being solely dependent on government assistance. This method also promotes independence and self-sufficiency among retirees, enabling them to enjoy their lives after work without financial concerns. In summary, while the notion of government-funded retirement care might be attractive, it is essential for individuals to take responsibility for their retirement planning to prevent excessive dependence on the government. By cultivating a mindset of personal saving and responsibility, we can create a more reliable and secure future for retirees, allowing them to relish their golden years with dignity and financial tranquility.
1398;Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree that this is the right course of action? Give reasons for your opinion.;, organization and companies as well as governments impose restrictions in work places and public amenities. It has become fashionable in the world today . I feel that smoking can be harmful, but I don’t think it should be forbidden completely. I would also argue that people should have the whether or not they should smoke.Allow me to present the three positive sides of smoking. Firstly, smoking certainly helps many people to relax. For some, it even improves concentration. If someone is upset or they have , to smoke to reduce the pressure or tension. people like to smoke when they are relaxing with friends. Secondly, governments throughout the world make huge profits from taxes on cigarettes. The income obtained through taxes provides funds which are used for building and public places such as parks, gardens, sports ground and foot paths. Thirdly, tobacco industry also employs tens of thousands of people all over the world, particularly in poorer countries such as Zimbabwe or the Philippines. Without cigarettes, these people would have no jobs.Despite these positive are lots of negative effects to smoking too. Initially, smoking has been proven to be very dangerous for health. cigarette contains more than 4000 chemical substances, therefore, it dangerous diseases such as heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis or lung cancer. According to a recent report in Britain close to 3,500 people are killed each year in road accidents and 120,000 are killed by smoking. Furthermore, smoking costs governments millions of dollars because of the large number of people who need treatment in hospitals for smoking-related problems. Moreover, passive smoking is also a major concern today. Recent research shows that non-smokers can suffer from health problems if they spend long periods of time among people who do smoke. In the UK children whose parents are are three times as likely to start smoking themselves .In short, I think the world would be a better place without cigarettes. However, the decision of whether smoke or not to smoke should be for each individual to make. I suggest that people should not smoke in a room or a place where there are non smokers, however they should be free to smoke elsewhere.;The discussion surrounding the prohibition of smoking in workplaces and public spaces has generated significant debate in recent years. I wholeheartedly support the idea that smoking should be banned in these areas. The primary justification for this ban is to safeguard non-smokers from the detrimental effects of second-hand smoke. Numerous studies indicate that passive smoking can lead to severe health risks, including lung cancer and heart disease. By outlawing smoking in offices and public spaces, governments and organizations can mitigate these health hazards and foster a healthier environment for all.Another compelling reason to endorse this ban is its potential to decrease the overall number of smokers. Allowing smoking in public venues can normalize the practice and make it more attractive to young people. By confining smoking to private settings, authorities can help deter the normalization of smoking and motivate individuals to quit. Additionally, smoking bans can alleviate the financial strain that smoking-related health issues place on healthcare systems. The World Health Organization reports that smoking accounts for millions of deaths worldwide annually, and the expenses associated with treating smoking-related diseases are staggering.In summary, I firmly believe that banning smoking in workplaces and public areas is the appropriate course of action. The advantages of this prohibition—such as protecting non-smokers from second-hand smoke, reducing the number of smokers, and lowering the economic impact of smoking-related health issues—far exceed any possible disadvantages. Therefore, governments and businesses should persist in implementing and enforcing smoking bans to cultivate a healthier and more sustainable environment for all.
665;Some cities create housing areas by providing taller buildings. Others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. What solution is better?;Some big cities, especially in Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama in Japan tend to build taller buildings like skyscrapers. Other local cities and places where are scarcely populated are built wider. This is quite understandable in terms of space, and there might be some solutions to dissipate populations around Japan.Initially, the main reason why people tend to gather in big cities is that there are many opportunities to get a job. There are famous headquarter companies and branches that are based in foreign countries. Therefore, more and more people move to the big cities so that many taller apartments and buildings are built to let them live in the limited space. There seems to be stressful due to people being densely populated, but infrastructures are well organized, especially transport, medical care, and security.In contrast, the population in the countryside becomes less. Therefore, there is plenty of space to build houses in the wider area. It seems to be well-relaxed and comfortable to live in a slow-paced lifestyle. But, it is apparently more difficult to obtain a new job, and lacking transport, so they need to rely on cars. In addition, the number of hospitals is much smaller than big cities. These issues are long controversial as a first world problem.Finally, as Covid-19 spread worldwide, many people are started to work at home with a lap top computer. Innumerable companies adopted IT systems that are able to work remotely. In addition, some companies had already stated this systemized working style will not change, however, Covid-19 completely ended. This means that many people do not necessarily need to live in big cities. Therefore, if the transport system is well organized, especially establishing and improving a train, which works faster and more frequently. This effort will be not only helpful to dissipate the population outside of the big cities, but also promotive to tackling with great infrastructures to countrysides.In conclusion, as a result, the densely populated cities will be able to reduce its population and increase the population in the countryside. As a result, some issues will be resolved and become well-balanced solutions. Finally, it might be able to build wider houses in big cities with reasonable prices than now.;The ongoing debate over the most effective methods for developing housing areas has led to a long-standing conversation among urban planners and policymakers. Two main strategies have emerged: constructing taller buildings versus expanding housing across a broader land area. Each method has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and the more suitable choice depends on various factors, such as the city’s geography, population density, and the overall quality of life for its residents.Constructing taller buildings, commonly known as high-rise or high-density development, offers several distinct benefits. This approach significantly increases the number of housing units while conserving land space, making it especially advantageous for cities facing land constraints, like those bordered by bodies of water or mountains. Furthermore, high-density developments can lead to more efficient resource use, lower transportation costs, and a stronger sense of community among residents. However, this strategy may also result in higher expenses, diminished natural light and ventilation, and increased maintenance costs.Conversely, spreading houses over a larger land area—termed low-density or suburban development—offers an alternative solution. This method provides more spacious living conditions, enhanced privacy, and a closer connection to nature, making it appealing to families with children or individuals in search of a quieter environment. However, it requires more land, which can lead to elevated infrastructure costs, greater transportation demands, and the potential for urban sprawl.In conclusion, the optimal solution is highly dependent on the specific needs and constraints of each individual city. A hybrid approach that incorporates aspects of both high-density and low-density development may prove most effective. By integrating taller buildings in central districts while preserving green spaces, cities can foster sustainability, efficiency, and a high quality of life for their inhabitants. Therefore, urban planners should take into account the distinctive features of their cities and embrace a flexible, mixed-use development strategy to create vibrant, livable, and environmentally responsible housing areas.
11;Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Athletes to be on the top need to have high-end facilities that a country can provide for them to be able to improve their strengths and skills. Some government opted to build facilities exclusively for training athletes for international sports goals, instead of building establishments for everyone to have the liberty of using the sports facilities. From my perspective, this phenomena is a negative development.Being able to discover an individual's potential, they need to have a support from any form of sources. Establishing sports facilities can help people to discover their own interests, talents and even skills in learning new things. Centers which offer utilities, equipments and state-of-the-art tools that provide learning sports can be a great advantage to people who want to train themselves on the things that can awaken their interests when it comes to sports.In addition, building these kind of establishments, not only for the purpose to train top athletes, but also for people to immerse themselves to different variaties of activities can help them socialize more with their peers. This is extremely beneficial that aside from doing sports that they are into, they get to play along with peers, discover one's potential and also learning from one another. Furthermore, these individuals can also have the future to be one of top athletes that a country can have.In conclusion, although there are countries that chose to have their sports establishments exclusively for training top athletes, I assert that these that actions can be lead to negative feedbacks. Government should allow everyone the privilege to use and avail facilities that can hone an individual's talents, skills and dexterity when it comes to sports and this can also be immensely benefical for both country and citizen alike.;The trend of nations focusing on specialized facilities for elite athletes at the expense of public sports infrastructure has ignited considerable discussion. On one side, the advantages of this strategy are clear. Investing in advanced facilities allows top athletes to receive exceptional training, which can enhance their performances and lead to more medals in international events. This not only boosts national pride but can also draw foreign investments. For example, countries like the United States and China have made notable progress in cultivating world-class athletes by equipping them with cutting-edge facilities and comprehensive training programs.Conversely, this emphasis on elite athletes poses significant challenges. By prioritizing high-performance sports, the needs of the general population may be overlooked, leading to a deficit in community sports facilities. This neglect can contribute to deteriorating public health and fitness levels, as many individuals may find themselves without access to basic sports infrastructure. Additionally, such an approach can foster a culture of exclusivity, where only a privileged few benefit from quality sports facilities, leaving the broader population behind. This can deepen social inequalities and restrict opportunities for gifted young athletes from less privileged backgrounds.In my view, this trend is problematic. While the desire to produce top-tier athletes is understandable, I believe that emphasizing public sports facilities is ultimately more advantageous. By ensuring accessible and affordable sports infrastructure for all, countries can encourage a culture of physical activity and health among their citizens. The benefits of such an approach are substantial, including lower healthcare costs, enhanced mental well-being, and a more productive workforce. Therefore, I advocate for a balanced strategy that supports both elite athletes and the creation of sports facilities for the general public. This would lead to a more inclusive and sustainable sporting environment that benefits everyone.
725;Some educationalists say that every child should be taught how to play a musical instrument. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;It is commonly known that music has always played an important role in upbringing of children and a lot of parents wish their kids play a musical instrument. However, I disagree that this skill is essential to every pupil.First of all, not all people are born with a talent for music, which is essential if one wants to learn how to play it. Some people are natural musicians and succeed in this sphere with ease. On the other hand, there are children for whom learning to play is a hard work and, eventually, they might start hating music instead of enjoying it. Some people are bound to become excellent engineers or doctors and for them learning to read and play music is just a waste of time.Another important factor is that all kids are different and for that reason each of them desires to have a different hobby. If all pupils spent time on music, those who are not interested in it would have less time on things that are really exciting for them. Undoubtedly, everybody has a right to spend their free time in the way they want.What is more, playing a musical instrument is not considered to be an essential skill for a successful career. More time should be devoted to more important subjects, such as Math, Science and Languages. These have more chance to be useful for people when they grow up and graduate from school.To sum up, teaching all children to play an instrument wouldn't be a good idea. It should be taught only to those who really want it as not only would it ditract a child from subjects and hobbies which are more important in their opinion, but also it cannot be mastered by everybody.;The idea that all children should be instructed in playing a musical instrument has ignited a lively discussion among educators. While some believe that this is crucial for a child's growth, I hold a nuanced view on the matter.On one side, acquiring the skill to play a musical instrument can provide a range of advantages for children. It has the potential to boost cognitive abilities like memory and spatial reasoning, as well as nurture discipline, creativity, and self-expression. Furthermore, engaging with a musical instrument can instill a sense of achievement and enhance a child's self-esteem, positively influencing their overall academic performance. Additionally, studies have indicated that musical training can also enhance language and mathematical skills.Conversely, mandating music lessons for every child may not be either practical or beneficial. Not all children have an inherent interest or talent for playing an instrument, and forcing them into such activities could result in frustration and a negative view of music. The financial burden of offering instrument lessons to all students could also be overwhelming for many schools, especially those in underfunded areas. Moreover, there are other critical subjects, like reading, writing, and math, that might need more focus and resources.In summary, while I acknowledge the significant benefits of learning to play an instrument, I do not see it as necessary for every child. Instead, schools could provide music lessons as optional extracurricular activities, inviting those who are interested to join and gain from the experience. Ultimately, a well-rounded approach that considers each child's individual interests and needs is likely the best way to advance music education.
73;Some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The thought of some experts, is that people from rich countries are not satisfied by an ipotetical increase in their economy. In this essay I will discuss this point of view and I will explain why I am not sure I agree with that.It is generally believed by some professional figures, that additionals rise in economic wealth are not so crucial for a rich coutry. People from countries sush as Japan, the U.S.A, Switzerland or Cina are aware of their wide economic power and these governments offer a lot of benefits for their citizens. Thus, people have yet what they want, such as fundings for projects, well-organized cities, a lot of job opportunities. In fact, they do not fell a significant sense of satisfaction in the increase of their economy.Made this point, it is also true that some surveys used by The Italian University of Parma, reveal that citizens from coutries which a strong economy, are really grateful and satisfied by any additional rise, in the economic sector. As consequence due to this increase, they can ask more fundings for some start up or to improve the technology equipment in schools. Personally, I tend to think as a matter of fact that this is the right view. Because it is logical that more money mean more opportunities in any sector of the country. Hospitals, schools, museum and even historical buildings can have the possibility to obteind a lot of benefits.To conclude, in this essay I discuss the generel view of some experts about people from rich countries. I also explained why I strongly disagree with them.;The connection between economic prosperity and citizen satisfaction has sparked considerable debate among scholars. Some contend that after reaching a certain level of affluence, further economic advancement fails to enhance the happiness of citizens. I partially concur with this view.On one side, it's evident that a nation's economic wealth can have limited influence on citizen satisfaction beyond a specific threshold. Once essential needs—like food, shelter, and healthcare—are fulfilled, additional wealth may not significantly boost happiness levels. For example, research indicates that in countries with high GDP per capita, increases in wealth do not correspond with proportional rises in citizen satisfaction. This observation points to diminishing returns from economic growth regarding overall happiness.Conversely, I believe it is inaccurate to claim that additional economic wealth has no bearing on citizen satisfaction. Increased wealth can still open up avenues for personal development, education, and recreational activities, all of which contribute to overall well-being. Moreover, economic growth can facilitate investments in public services and infrastructure, enhancing citizens' quality of life. For instance, a prosperous nation might invest in renewable energy initiatives that lower pollution and improve public health, thereby increasing satisfaction among its populace.In summary, while I acknowledge that there may be limits to how economic wealth affects citizen satisfaction, I do not agree that additional wealth is insignificant. Economic growth can still create opportunities and enhance public services, leading to greater satisfaction among citizens. Ultimately, the interplay between economic wealth and citizen satisfaction is intricate and shaped by numerous factors, necessitating a nuanced perspective to fully comprehend this relationship.
1061;Some museums and art galleries charge admission fees, while others have free entry.Do you think the advantages of charging for admission outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many artistic places prefer to have an entry fee, whereas others let free access. I fully think that the benefits to have admission fees compensate the drawbacks to be not free.Many individuals would visit museum or art galleries if it were free which could attract more tourists. Unfortunately, admission charge decreases the possibility to discover paintings or masterpieces. However, before being a cultural place, art galleries are a place where numerous employees work. Indeed, if visitors had not to purchase the entrance, workforce would be not paid and the place would be not clean as museum should be. Moreover, huge museums as the British Museum have some sponsors to restore masterpieces whereas small museums have sometimes not the fundings and hence, admission fees would help it. Then, having an entry fee limit the number of individuals who do not really want to see art and appreciate the place.Concerning to cultural places, museum and art galleries know that many households could not afford ticket entrances for their offspring so many museums establish reduced price for teenagers and children. This project improves the relation between young people and the culture, then it allows children to be attracted to culture, partipate to the technical expenses behind the entry fee and after to visit again some cultural places when they will grow up and purchase the full price. Moreover, purchasing tickets help to the economy of the country which sometimes famous cultural places are a significant part of country's income. For instance, admission fees in museum are two third of the tourism's outcome in France.To conclude, I believe that admission fees should outweigh free entrance because it does not let the worth process of museum to work. Even if sometimes admission fees are costly for us, there is always a meaning behind the prices.;The discussion surrounding whether museums and art galleries should implement admission fees has generated considerable debate. Some claim that these fees are essential, while others argue they limit public access to art and culture. I believe that the drawbacks of charging admission far exceed the benefits.Supporters of admission fees often point out that they can serve as a vital revenue stream for museums and galleries, enabling them to maintain and enhance their facilities and collections. For example, the Louvre in Paris charges a significant entry fee, which funds the preservation of its extensive collection, including the renowned Mona Lisa. Additionally, these fees can help manage visitor numbers, reducing overcrowding and ensuring a more enjoyable experience for attendees.However, I contend that the negative aspects of charging admission are more pronounced. For one, such fees can create barriers for individuals and families with limited incomes, further entrenching social and economic disparities. Those already at a disadvantage may miss out on valuable opportunities to engage with and learn from cultural institutions. Moreover, free admission has the potential to increase visitor attendance and invigorate local economies, as more people are likely to visit and spend in the surrounding community. The National Museum of Scotland, for instance, has experienced a notable rise in visitor numbers since it made admission free.In summary, while there are certain advantages to having admission fees, I strongly feel that the disadvantages are more impactful. Providing free entry allows museums and galleries to foster social equity, boost visitor attendance, and support local economies. Ultimately, access to art and culture should be considered a fundamental right, not a luxury available only to those who can pay.
1355;Some parents encourage young people to leave home while others think they should stay with the family, discuss and give your opinion;Many parents encourage young people to leave home when they become older, while others think they should stay at home with the family. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.With the tremendous influence of modernisation, remarkable changes have taken place in the family structure to such an extent that nowadays, youngsters are motivated by their parents to live alone as they grow up. However, some people are of the view that it is more practical for a youngster to live with their family.On the one hand, there are many positive aspects to youths living away from their parents at young age. This provides the opportunity to young people to live a life on their own terms and make any decisions without the interference of their parents. Besides, living alone not only makes them independent but also makes them self-reliant, which is a crucial life skill to their successful career. For instance, managing all the house chores such as cleaning, paying bills, cooking and so on will make them well experienced at learning and managing diverse activities and will also boost their confidence.On the other hand, there is no denying the fact that youngsters living away from their family may find themselves in circumstances that may adversely affect their life. Naïve and inexperienced young people in the absence of parental supervision are more likely to fall prey to bad influence and dangerous activities, such as drugs or alcohol consumption, which may jeopardise their career or lead them astray from moral values. However, this situation is less likely to take place with youngsters still living with their parents. Besides, emotional bonding and family relationships can be maintained better if everyone is living together under one roof.In my opinion, although encouraging youngsters to live alone may lead them to learn various life skills, negative aspects and risks associated with living alone can far outweigh the benefits.This response covers the task topic well, by discussing the positive and negative aspects of living alone as a young adult, and the writer’s opinion has also been included. Paragraphing helps to present ideas in an orderly way, and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay. There is some repetitive use of the word ‘make’ in the first body paragraph, which could have been avoided. Apart from that, the writer’s vocabulary seems to be quite rich and allows them to communicate ideas precisely and clearly. Overall, this essay seems to be worthy of IELTS Band 8.;The question of when young people should depart from their family homes is a contentious topic among parents. Some advocate for encouraging their children to leave at an early age, while others believe it is more beneficial for them to remain in the family environment for as long as possible. In this essay, I will examine both viewpoints and share my own perspective on the issue.On one side of the debate, some parents argue that leaving home early can be advantageous for their children. This experience fosters independence, self-reliance, and a sense of responsibility. Living independently enables young individuals to learn crucial life skills, such as managing finances, cooking, and cleaning. Moreover, moving out can empower them to delve into their own interests and pursue personal goals without parental influence.Conversely, some parents feel that their children should remain with the family for an extended period. They contend that family support and guidance are vital for young people's emotional and psychological growth. Staying at home can offer a sense of security and stability, especially during economically challenging times. Additionally, parents can continue to provide advice and direction, helping their children make well-informed decisions about their futures.In my view, the choice of when to leave home should depend on the individual’s unique circumstances and readiness for independence. While some young people may be prepared to strike out on their own at a young age, others might require additional time to acquire essential life skills. Ultimately, parents should engage in open and candid discussions with their children to ascertain the best path forward. This approach can facilitate a smooth transition to independence and help young people realize their full potential.
1335;Some people believe that excessive use of modern technologies, such as computers and smartphones, is negatively affecting the reading and writing skills of our young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Parents and teachers in many countries are feeling increasingly concerned about the effect of digital devices on vital skills of school-aged children. They are alarmed by the declining ability of young people to read and write and its suspected link to the influence of modern technology, and I wholeheartedly share their view. This essay will outline the reasons to watch out for the consequences of widespread use of computers and mobile phones by our youngsters.Primary school is a very important period when children develop their fine motor skills, which are involved in learning to write. Time spent typing on a mobile phone or a tablet doesn’t contribute to the necessary workout of the small muscles in the hands and fingers of young people. Not only do they get less practice in writing but also fewer opportunities to train in spelling words, since the ‘autocorrect’ and ‘autocomplete’ features use the first few letters to guess the entire word, therefore making it unnecessary for the child to remember and type it correctly. Another companion of unrestrained use of mobile devices is the jargon that is often used in text messages, where words are shortened or distorted. Exposure to ‘texting’ tends to replace the correct words with abbreviations in young minds, causing their spelling accuracy to decline.Reading is another casualty of unrestricted access to smart devices. Video content can be more appealing and immersive for kids and they often are automatically drawn to it instead of books. Reading requires regular practice and needs to become a habit in order to fully develop as a skill; however, it is being perceived as a boring and labourious activity by many youngsters compared to effortless video-watching. Easy and instant access to videos and movies pushes books further down the list of preferences of young audience, and it takes a significant commitment from parents and teachers to ensure that children continue to read books.To sum up, modern technology can be a friend or a foe for young children, depending on the choices adults in their lives make, regulating the amount of screen time and its purpose. Without due care the writing and reading abilities of kids can be harmed by other, more enjoyable activities they can use the devices for.";The widespread integration of modern technologies, like computers and smartphones, has ignited a vigorous discussion regarding their effects on the reading and writing abilities of young individuals. While some contend that these technologies have a negative impact, I somewhat concur with this viewpoint.On one hand, excessive reliance on contemporary technology can indeed impede the growth of reading and writing skills. The relentless flow of information available on social media and the internet can diminish attention spans and shallow the depth of reading and writing. Moreover, features like autocorrect and spell-check on digital devices may lead young people to depend on technology for error correction, rather than honing their own proofreading abilities. This can ultimately result in a decline in the quality of their writing.Conversely, modern technologies also present significant opportunities for young individuals to enhance their reading and writing skills. For example, e-books and online resources grant access to a wide range of literary works and educational content, making it easier for young people to develop a passion for reading. Furthermore, online writing communities and blogs encourage them to express and share their thoughts, thereby nurturing their writing abilities.In summary, while I acknowledge that excessive use of modern technology can negatively affect the reading and writing skills of young people, I also believe that these tools have the potential to enhance and support literacy skills when used judiciously. It is crucial for parents, educators, and policymakers to advocate for a balanced approach to technology usage, ensuring that young people can benefit from its advantages while cultivating solid reading and writing skills.
877;Some people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime. Others believe that there are better ways to reduce crime. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;The increasing number of criminals are appeared in a society where some people advocate the longer incarceration resulting in a reduction of crime. However, some are divided and think that a number of better ways can help lessen the cases of crime. Which strategy should be taken to tackle this problem? This essay attempts to explore the view of both sides.An increase in the rate of crimes is a raising concerns in the community. A longer prison sentence seems to be the straightforward method to impede the crimes caused. In fact, a continuous incarceration is no room for offenders to commit the crimes in the community. This seemingly becomes an immediate achievement in the short term period. Some people deeply believe the mindset of criminals can be eliminated by the deterrence effect of the longer sentences which deprive of a person's freedom in life. In addition, it is generally recognized that the offenders have to be punished in effect of their guilty acts. The outlaws deserve a lengthening prison term in which they repent their offenses resulting in a decline in the number of crimes.Indeed, the incarceration can limit the offender's actions in a place at some points. However, it is not difficult to find there is a higher rate of reoffending upon release from prison across the countries. In 2013, the U.S.A. had a reoffending rate of 52% which prisoners reoffended within a year of release with a record of 49.2% in the U.K. The proportion of reoffenders occupied nearly a half of criminals. It reveals that the prison sentences is not a effective way to decrease the number of criminal cases. This implies that a decline in the crimes can be achieved araising from a decline in the likelihood of reoffending. Rehabilitation during the course of their sentence can be adopted to tackle this problems. These include direct therapeutic interventions to address the psychological causes of criminal behaviours as well as services to prepare offenderes to successfully reintegrate into the community after release. Those actions include the provision of academic programmes, vocational courses and employment opportunities.My take on this is that the incarceration alone is rarely considered enough in the control of criminal cases. A longer prison term only increase the financial cost from the government, but it cannot lower the likelihood of criminal offenses. The governments have to address the root factors causing offenses is the prime issue to reduce the crimes.;The ongoing discussion about reducing crime has led to diverse opinions, with some advocating for lengthier prison sentences while others suggest alternative strategies. Proponents of longer sentences contend that this method acts as a deterrent, discouraging individuals from engaging in criminal activities. They believe that the dread of spending extended periods in prison will prevent potential offenders from committing crimes. Moreover, this strategy effectively removes criminals from society, thereby diminishing the chances of further offenses.Conversely, some argue that lengthening prison sentences may not be the most efficient way to combat crime. They emphasize the importance of addressing the root causes of criminal behavior, such as poverty, lack of education, and unemployment, as fundamental steps in preventing crime. Instead of concentrating exclusively on punishment, advocates of this perspective propose directing resources towards rehabilitation programs, community development initiatives, and social support systems. Their aim is to resolve the underlying factors that contribute to criminality, which in turn could lower recidivism rates and foster a safer community.I believe that while longer prison sentences might offer a temporary fix, they fail to tackle the fundamental issues that lead to crime. Thus, I argue for a more comprehensive approach that combines rehabilitation, education, and community development to achieve lasting results. By investing in individuals and their communities, we can aspire to a society where crime is less prevalent and individuals who commit offenses are provided opportunities for reform and reintegration. Ultimately, an effective crime reduction strategy needs to balance both punitive measures and rehabilitative efforts.
379;Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;This essay agrees on the need of that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities, but always under one premise: those students should have demonstrated their capability to comply with university studies successfully.There are countries, for example Scandinavian countries, where their government helps students by giving them specific students' loans. These loans have special characteristics such as long loan terms and low interest rates. It is not for free, but at least a higher number of students can have access to upgrade their studies.And in many other European countries university fees are not large, so most of the students can access to bachelor studies. What it's not easy is having the needed qualification you need to access to the specific university study you want.If we talk in worlwide terms, university studies are limited to wealthy people.In fact I read only a couple of weeks ago that only a 17% of worlds' population have university studies. There is a contradiction between developped and non developped countries. As an example, in most countries in Europe we have too many university students. Actually they cannot find a job easily at their own country and sometimes they emigrate to another country in Europe or outside Europe. Furthermore vocational workers such as plumbers, waiters or receptionists can't be found, there no unemployment in vocational work!.The opposite happens in non developped countries. As university studies have large fees, almost nobody can access to them, and vocational workers suffer unemployment, so they need to emigrate to other countries to find jobs.To summarize, I believe fees should not be an obstacle to study in a university. The obstable should be your previous califications.Education and Health, as much as a country can hold them, should be available for all population, poor and wealthy, with non differentiation.;The debate over whether governments should cover the entire tuition fees for students wishing to attend universities has become increasingly intense. While some advocate for full government funding of higher education, I hold a more nuanced perspective.On one side, funding complete tuition fees can offer several advantages. It enhances access to higher education, enabling students from low-income families to achieve their academic aspirations free from financial worries. This increased accessibility can result in a more educated workforce, which in turn benefits the economy. Moreover, providing free university education could foster social mobility and help to diminish income inequality.Conversely, fully financing tuition for all university students represents a considerable financial strain on governments. The expenses associated with free university education can be significant, potentially necessitating reallocating funds from critical public services like healthcare and infrastructure. Furthermore, not all students may capitalize on the opportunity of free education, leading to inefficient use of resources.Rather than covering full tuition fees for every student, governments might explore offering targeted financial assistance, such as scholarships or loans, to those in genuine need. This approach would allow support for students who cannot afford higher education while ensuring that governmental resources are utilized more effectively. In summary, although I recognize the advantages of free university education, I believe that governments should focus on providing financial aid to those who require it most, rather than fully subsidizing tuition for all students.
1428;Some people believe that having a pet such as a cat or a dog helps old people to live a more enjoyable life and to stay healthier. How do you think old people benefit from having a pet? Do you think there are any problems related to old people who have pets?;, and indeed, the importance of relationship between human beings and their pets has been proved to be slightly exaggerated in some nations. However, although problems regarding may affect the health conditions of old people, the benefits that these lovely animals bring to them, physically and mentally alike, are clearly undeniable.In of physical benefits, the well-being of elderly people with pets compared to those without pets, since not only do they have to take care of themselves, the responsibility ensure their one fed and well looked after encourages them to become even more active. Due to these extra activities, this might not have an obvious influence on their health, but at least this could help them to avoid bad . Coupled with physical side, their mental wellbeing will also be improved, and the reason is that having someone to take care of would reduce the chance of feeling . Therefore, their could be minimised.In spite of the above advantages, the interaction between pets and vulnerable old people still exist. One of the major concerns is the of these animal on their tracheas, especially those asthma. virtually invisible in the air, many asthma symptoms are caused unconsciously by pets. In addition to the fact that old people might experience difficulty in looking after their pets, as their health conditions are limited, could become even more when they try take care of others.In conclusion, it is true that obstacles still exist for elderly people in adopting pets, but the benefits of this topic its . For such reasons, instead of , further support would be far more beneficial.;As individuals grow older, they frequently face challenges such as social isolation, loneliness, and reduced physical activity, all of which can adversely affect their mental and physical health. However, one effective way to counteract these issues is through pet ownership, particularly with animals like cats and dogs. I strongly believe that having a pet can significantly enhance the quality of life for older adults, allowing them to lead a happier and healthier existence.The advantages of pet ownership for older adults are extensive. First and foremost, pets offer companionship and opportunities for social interaction, helping to reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation. Furthermore, pets promote physical activity through walking or engaging in play, which can aid in maintaining mobility and flexibility. They also provide a sense of purpose and responsibility, contributing to improved self-esteem and overall well-being. Research indicates that older adults with pets often exhibit lower blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and body mass index in comparison to those without pets.Nonetheless, there are potential drawbacks to consider regarding older adults and pet ownership. Caring for a pet can be physically challenging, especially for individuals with mobility issues or health concerns. Additionally, the costs associated with pet care—such as food, veterinary fees, and supplies—can place a considerable financial strain on older adults living on fixed incomes. Furthermore, if a pet requires frequent veterinary attention or displays behavioral challenges, it can become a source of stress and anxiety for the owner.In summary, while there are some obstacles associated with pet ownership for older adults, the benefits of companionship, increased physical activity, and a renewed sense of purpose significantly outweigh the negatives. With appropriate planning and support, older adults can reap the multitude of rewards that come with having a pet, leading to a more fulfilling and healthier life.
1300;Some people believe that homework should not be given to school children. Others, however, say that homework is an important requirement for children to be able to develop appropriately. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The benefits of giving or not giving homework to children are often debated. Some people feel that children have enough work to do during one day whilst at school, whereas others feel that the more work set, the better.It is true that schools today place more and more demands and pressure on children. The competition to do well, to enter a good university and to get a good job is significant. This has led to the ideology that children should do as much schoolwork as possible in order to help their intellectual development. The argument, however, that more is better is not always valid. There comes a point, especially for a child, when more knowledge cannot be absorbed in a day. When a child has possibly 7 or 8 classes a day on different subjects, he or she is processing a lot of information already. To give more work to be done at home, therefore, would be pointless and even counterproductive. In addition to this, although it is important to be educated, childhood should also be a time when there is an opportunity to just play and enjoy unstructured time. Homework can significantly lessen the possibilities of doing this.On the other hand, it can be argued that there is a place for homework. If study at school is not overdone, the opportunity to look at work again and extend ideas can be an invaluable exercise. It’s easy to forget one thing that has been taught once, but if that concept is revisited a second time, the brain has time to reprocess and likely better understand and remember.It seems to me that there is a place for homework for today’s children. What must be remembered, though, is that homework needs to be limited to age-appropriate parameters, so that a balance can be struck between study and free time and relaxation.;The ongoing debate surrounding the assignment of homework to school children has been a topic of discussion for many years. While some argue that homework is unnecessary and may even hinder a child's growth, others assert that it plays a crucial role in their academic development. This essay will explore both perspectives and present my own viewpoint.Opponents of homework contend that it can cause significant stress and anxiety among children. They argue that the lengthy hours spent on assignments detract from valuable time that could be spent playing, relaxing, and participating in extracurricular activities, all of which are crucial for a child's physical and mental health. Additionally, they believe that homework can stifle creativity and imagination by creating pressure to complete tasks rather than allowing children to explore concepts and learn at their own pace.Conversely, supporters of homework maintain that it is an essential tool for reinforcing educational material and fostering vital skills such as time management, self-discipline, and critical thinking. They claim that assignments provide students with the opportunity to review and practice what they have learned in class, leading to improved understanding and retention of knowledge. Furthermore, homework can instill a sense of responsibility and accountability, as children learn how to prioritize tasks and effectively manage their time.In my view, homework can indeed be advantageous for children's development, provided it is assigned in moderation. While excessive homework can be detrimental, a reasonable amount can reinforce learning and cultivate essential skills. For instance, a study conducted in Finland demonstrated that students who received a balanced amount of homework performed better on exams and exhibited superior time management skills compared to those who were overwhelmed with assignments. Therefore, I believe homework should be assigned thoughtfully, considering both the quantity and quality of tasks, to ensure that it contributes positively to children's growth rather than hindering it.
1369;Some people believe that preserving natural environment is crucial, but make no effort to do so (reasons and solutions);Some people believe that preserving natural environment is crucial, however, most make no effort to do so. Why do you think this is happening? What are some simple actions that could help the environment?It is commonly believed that preservation of natural resources is imperative, yet most people seem to exert no effort in doing so. Understanding the causes of this negligent attitude may help with devising some simple measures to safeguard the deteriorating environment.Lack of awareness is probably the foremost reason why the vast majority of individuals appears to be unmindful of the current environmental issues. Normally, people have tendency to downplay abstract problems, or those to happen in the distant future. This is because they are not properly informed of the possible detrimental effects of taking the environment for granted. To illustrate, residents in urban areas often deliberately dump their into the nearby creeks and drainage canals causing them to become clogged. It is only when devastating floods strike, that they come to realize the consequences of their actions.Some basic solutions that could be carried out are extensive awareness through all forms of communication and strict implementation of waste management. In addition to the traditional press, social media is a powerful means of disseminating information regarding the impending disasters and their potential hazards. This is a good way of persuading the public to actively take part in the campaign. Another straightforward solution, and by far the least anyone can do to help save the nature is disposing of garbage thoughtfully. Apart from avoiding throwing trash anywhere, everyone should practice proper segregation of biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and recyclable wastes at all times. These actions, when coordinated by the local governments, can be tremendously successful.In conclusion, while individual awareness is key to maintaining a healthy ecosystem, concerted efforts of governments and are much more effective in achieving such goal.The response is well written, it contains reasons, solutions and fully addresses the task. The ideas aren’t repeated, they are conveyed in a clear and easy to understand manner and organised well with sufficient use of cohesive devices. The vocabulary is varied, sentence structures are complex and instances of incorrect grammar are hardly noticeable. Overall, this essay is likely to achieve Band 8 in IELTS.;Protecting the natural environment is essential for ensuring a healthy and sustainable planet. Despite many people recognizing the significance of environmental conservation, there is often a gap between this awareness and actual action. This disconnect can be attributed to several factors.One key issue is the lack of understanding about simple, everyday actions that can aid in environmental preservation. Many individuals feel that making a difference requires monumental efforts, which can seem daunting and discouraging. Additionally, the convenience and low cost of single-use plastics and other harmful products often lead people to choose these options over more sustainable alternatives.Another important consideration is the perceived conflict between economic growth and environmental protection. Some individuals may worry that focusing on the environment could negatively affect their own financial stability or that of their community. Additionally, societal norms and cultural beliefs can influence a person's willingness to embrace eco-friendly practices.To bridge this gap between awareness and action, various solutions can be implemented. First and foremost, educational and awareness campaigns can help inform individuals about the small yet significant changes they can adopt in their everyday lives, such as minimizing plastic usage, conserving water, and utilizing public transport. Furthermore, governments and businesses can contribute by enforcing policies that promote sustainability and by providing affordable, eco-friendly alternatives. Community-driven initiatives that encourage shared responsibility for environmental conservation can also inspire individuals to take action. By addressing these underlying causes of inaction and adopting effective solutions, we can empower individuals to positively impact the environment and work toward a more sustainable future.
1322;Some people believe that the best way to solve environmental problems is to increase the price of fuel.Do you agree or disagree?;"Raising the price of car fuel is believed by some people to be an excellent method to solve the growing number of environmental issues. However, I strongly disagree with this idea, as doing so would make life difficult for lower-income households. While making fuel more expensive wouldn’t change the habits of wealthy families, switching to fossil fuel alternatives could prove to be much more beneficial for the environment.The most compelling reason against raising the cost of fuel is that the upper classes of society will hardly be affected by rising fuel costs, as this only makes up a minor proportion of their expenditure. They will continue to use their personal vehicles as they wish without a thought for the environment or the higher fuel prices, even if their country has state-of-the-art public transportation.Those who will feel the crunch of this decision are the middle-class and lower-income households, since travelling is a major part of most people’s routine, be it to work, school or shopping. Driving is almost unavoidable in many instances; therefore, raising the price of petrol would only serve to widen the gap between the rich and poor, and serve as an inadvertent form of discrimination.Another reason why increasing the cost of fuel is far from the best way to deal with environmental pollution is that now there are much more viable alternatives. Due to the rapid advances in technology, scientists and engineers have been able to develop several alternatives to fossil fuel, such as cars powered by electricity or naturally produced biofuel. The move to adopt clean energy sources instead of fossil fuels is a much more promising alternative compared to simply making fuel more expensive.In conclusion, I believe that governments of the world should invest more time and money in finding alternatives to fossil fuels that are more environmentally friendly, rather than simply raising the cost of petrol.";Environmental issues have emerged as a significant global concern, prompting various proposed solutions. One of the most debated options is raising fuel prices, with many arguing that this approach is among the most effective for addressing environmental challenges. In this essay, I will present my agreement with this viewpoint.By increasing fuel prices, we would likely see a decline in consumption, as individuals would be less inclined to rely on fuel-intensive vehicles and equipment. This reduction would consequently decrease greenhouse gas emissions, which are a leading factor in climate change and air pollution. Furthermore, higher fuel costs would encourage both individuals and businesses to explore and invest in alternative energy sources, such as solar and wind, which are much cleaner and sustainable.Additionally, the funds collected from higher fuel prices could be allocated to support various environmental initiatives, including reforestation projects, pollution remediation efforts, and the advancement of green technologies. This strategy not only addresses the environmental harm associated with fuel use but also fosters sustainable development.Nonetheless, it is essential to consider the potential repercussions of elevated fuel prices on low-income families and small businesses that may find it challenging to cope with increasing expenses. To alleviate this burden, governments might implement measures like subsidies or tax incentives to assist these vulnerable groups.In summary, raising fuel prices represents a practical approach to tackling environmental issues by reducing fuel consumption, encouraging the adoption of alternative energy sources, and generating funds for environmental programs. While there are certain challenges to this approach, they can be managed through thoughtful policy-making and execution. Ultimately, I strongly believe that higher fuel prices can be instrumental in safeguarding our environment for generations to come.
1273;Some people believe that we cannot learn anything from the past for our life today, while others believe that history is a valuable source of information to understand human's life.Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is true that these days people say there is little we can gain from previous history, whereas others think that history is a key source to understand our lives. Although there are some strong arguments against learning history, I agree with learning history to know life of human.There are two reasons why people think there is nothing to gain from history. Firstly, there is evidence to support the idea that learning history stresses people out. Based on a survey conducted by Standford University, 57 percent of people consider learning past life of humans a primary source of stress, while less than 6 percent of people said studying previous humans' life was not a stressor. Secondly, people may not have time to remember historical events because the constant stimulation and hustle and bustle of society is holding them back from their life. In turn, they are more likely to regard learning history as useless.Despite the negative drawbacks, I support that historical event is great information to comprehend human's life. The main benefit of a historical event is that it can have a positive impact on people, especially children, as they grow up. Since history has more connection and support to our lives, it allows children to become more insightful and knowledgeable and discover advanced perspectives. For example, I have been widening my perspective through historical events in my family or country because gaining history regarding my family and nation taught me the right attitude to understand today. However, if I did not know any history, I would not have had an opportunity to understand human life and self-development. So, learning history should be encouraged.In conclusion, while I recognize the possible disadvantages of learning history, I believe that the benefits of gaining past events far outweigh them in the long term.;The ongoing debate over the extent to which we can learn from history has evoked passionate discussions among people. Some contend that history is largely irrelevant to modern life, asserting that past events offer little in the way of valuable lessons. They argue that our world is in a state of constant flux, rendering the conditions of the past too dissimilar to provide any meaningful insights for today.Conversely, many hold a strong belief that history is a reservoir of knowledge, rich with lessons that can aid us in navigating life's complexities. Proponents of this view argue that examining historical events helps us grasp the origins of current issues, recognize patterns and trends, and cultivate a deeper understanding of both the successes and failures of those who came before us. For example, the rise and collapse of empires, the repercussions of conflicts, and the influence of social movements all offer critical insights into governance, diplomacy, and social justice.I personally align with the latter perspective. History is replete with examples of triumphs and failures that can guide our present-day choices and actions. By studying past experiences, we can learn from others’ mistakes, avoiding the pitfalls encountered by earlier generations while building on their successes. The Great Depression serves as a powerful reminder of the need for careful economic stewardship, while the Civil Rights Movement encourages us to persist in the pursuit of equality and justice. In summary, history is an invaluable source of wisdom that enhances our understanding of the human experience. I wholeheartedly believe that we can draw important lessons from the past to improve our lives today.
1342;Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military, while others disagree (opinion);Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military. Others think that women are less suitable for this kind of job. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Sample EssayIn recent years gender equality in employment has been the topic of heated debate. While some may argue that women are less suited for certain jobs such as with the police or the military, I believe that female candidates should be treated the same as their male counterparts.Those who consider women to be unsuited for some kinds of jobs including the police or the military often hold that opinion because such jobs are extremely physically demanding. As the female body has smaller muscles and less physical strength compared to male body, women may have difficulty engaging in strenuous activity which can be exhausting even for men. In military service, female soldiers are more likely to struggle while defending themselves than their male peers when they are forced to move around carrying heavy firearms in the battle, which can increase their risk of mission failure. Because of the hazards and extreme conditions they may encounter, some people advocate that women are not suitable for work in these fields.Nevertheless, I believe that female applicants should be considered for police or military placements without a gender bias, because women are more suited to certain tasks. In the police service, female officers can perform important roles on some occasions such as a body search where male officers are restricted from touching female convicts. In the military service, female nursing staff are more likely to care better for injured soldiers since maternal instinct makes them dedicated and heart-warming professionals. Furthermore, for the sake of fairness to all, job seekers should have an equal opportunity to choose their jobs freely, regardless of gender. Many women have the desire to work in the police and the military and some of them have relevant expertise and qualifications. Therefore, they should not be discriminated against in employment opportunities for these jobs.In conclusion, although some say that women are incompatible with police and military duties because of the high physical demands, I believe that they should be treated as equal to men. This is because there are certain roles with the police and the military that are more suitable for women than men, and therefore both genders should have equal employment opportunities.;"The issue of equal treatment for women in police and military roles has been a topic of intense debate for many years. Advocates for equality argue that women should have the same job opportunities as men in these sectors, asserting that women possess similar capabilities and strengths. This viewpoint is rooted in the principle of gender equality, which asserts that women deserve the same rights and opportunities as men in all areas of life, including employment.Conversely, some opponents of this notion contend that certain roles in law enforcement and the military necessitate a level of physical strength and endurance that may not be compatible with women. They also voice concerns regarding the safety and welfare of female officers in high-pressure situations. However, such arguments often reflect outdated stereotypes about women's abilities and overlook the numerous women who have demonstrated exceptional competence and courage in these fields.In truth, women have made considerable contributions to law enforcement and military services, enhancing the effectiveness and diversity of these institutions. A commitment to treating women as equals allows these organizations to access a broader array of talent and skills, resulting in improved outcomes and more comprehensive decision-making. Moreover, ensuring equal treatment for women in these sectors is not just a matter of justice; it also serves as a catalyst for advancing gender equality throughout society.In summary, the belief that women should be treated as equals to men in law enforcement and military job applications is anchored in principles of fairness, equality, and an acknowledgment of women’s capabilities. It is crucial to confront and dismantle the stereotypes and biases that limit women’s participation in these areas, fostering an environment where women can serve with dignity and respect. By doing this, we can enhance these institutions and promote a more equitable society."
1376;Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research (discuss);Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research for the benefit of human beings, while others argue that it is wrong. Discuss both views and give your opinion.People have different views on how medical research should be conducted and tested. Although many people support the use of for developing medicines, I personally believe that animal testing is morally wrong.The main reason why some people value to conduct medical research is because animal testing has contributed to many life-saving cures and treatments. It is true that nearly every medical breakthrough in the last 100 years has resulted directly from research using animals. For example, experiments in which dogs had their pancreases removed led directly to the discovery of insulin, critical to saving the lives of diabetics. Furthermore, it is impossible to release to the market before proving it no harm to humans and laboratory mice are appropriate research subjects because they are similar to human beings in many ways.However, I people who consider medical development that involved the use of animals cruel and unacceptable. I believe that the lives of all creatures should be respected and we, humans, have no right to for our own benefits. Governments should invest in developing alternative methods that can replace when doing medical research. For example, a software program can be developed to model a human immune system and new drugs can be tested on the software rather than animals. In this way, no animals will suffer from the medical tests and the society can still benefit from medical development.In conclusion, although it is undoubtedly true that animal testing has helped scientists in drug developments and medical discoveries, I believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused to animals and we should use alternative methods when doing medical research that do not involve animals suffering.This is a great essay. It addresses the two sides of the argument by exploring reasons why animals should and should not be used in medical research. The ideas are well explained and supported by examples. The use of paragraphing is efficient and helps with logical sequencing of ideas. Linking words are used appropriately to achieve the necessary cohesion. Author’s meaning is skillfully conveyed by the use of wide range of vocabulary. Even though there are some inaccurately used expressions, they don’t hinder understanding. Most sentences are error-free, instances of faulty grammar are rare. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;The role of animals in medical research has been a contentious issue for many years. Supporters of animal research contend that it is essential for the progression of human health and medicine. They point out that animal testing has contributed to significant medical advancements, such as the development of vaccines, antibiotics, and cancer therapies.Conversely, there are strong opponents of animal research who raise ethical and moral objections. They assert that animals are sentient beings capable of experiencing pain and suffering, and therefore, using them for research purposes infringes on their rights. These critics also highlight the availability of alternative methods, like computer simulations and in vitro testing, which could serve as effective substitutes for animal testing.Nonetheless, advocates of animal testing argue that these alternatives are not yet advanced enough to fully replace the need for animals in research. They maintain that animal models are vital for assessing the safety and effectiveness of new drugs and treatments, and argue that the overall benefits of animal research outweigh the associated costs. Additionally, many researchers emphasize that animal testing is conducted under strict regulations, ensuring the welfare of the animals involved.In summary, while there are compelling arguments on both sides, it is undeniable that animal testing has played a crucial role in medical advancements. It is equally important to consider the ethical dilemmas associated with this practice and to continue seeking alternative methods. Ultimately, a balanced approach that weighs both the benefits and drawbacks of animal testing is essential for conducting medical research responsibly and humanely. Such an approach can help advance human health while also striving to reduce animal suffering.
1057;Some people feel that entertainers such as film stars, pop musicians or sports stars are paid too much money.Do you agree or disagree?Which other types of job should be highly paid?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Jobs such as actors, musicians or athlete earns a lot of money, however, a part of people argued that these kinds of people are overpaid. In my opinion, I disagree with this view and believes that they deserved the high salary.People who works as a movie stars, musicians and sports player deserved high money paid. This is because they advocated all there time and effort to get the salary that they have today. Before they become famous, they only have few incomes or even get nothing. That is to say, many musicians did not get any payment at the begining of their career, so do the actors and sports players, they spent their time but do not get any money. For instance, before being a well-known musicians, they have to spend their own money on buying equipment to produce musics or to public the songs they have made. Also, the creativety and their works cannot be measured by money. Thus, they deserved high salary because of their profession and uncopyable works.Jobs which needs professional skills and the job envolves high risk shoul also be highly paid. Such as doctors and programmers, their job are unplaceable because these envolved professional knowledge that not everyone had. Moreover, people works in high-risk environment deserved high payment too. For example, fire-fighters, they might got hurt or even die while working. Therefore, higher salary is needed for jobs that need special skills and career with high risk.To sum up, I agree with the statement because of the reasons above, and jobs with special knowledge and people works in dangerous environment should also be highly paid.;The debate over whether entertainers, including film stars, musicians, and athletes, are overpaid is a contentious one. Personally, I believe these individuals often receive excessive compensation for their work. The amounts they earn can be astronomical, with some celebrities raking in tens of millions of dollars annually. Although they provide joy and entertainment to countless people, their salaries appear disproportionate to the value they offer.In contrast, there are many professions that are crucial to society yet remain underpaid and undervalued. For example, teachers, nurses, and social workers play vital roles in our communities’ well-being, yet they receive relatively meager salaries. These dedicated professionals devote their lives to educating, healing, and supporting vulnerable populations, and their efforts directly influence the quality of life for many.Additionally, professions that demand extensive education, skill, and risk—such as those of doctors, engineers, and firefighters—also deserve higher compensation. These individuals undergo rigorous training and often face danger to ensure public safety and deliver essential services. For instance, doctors dedicate many years to become specialists, and their expertise is critical for saving lives and enhancing healthcare outcomes.In summary, while entertainers do add value to our lives, their high salaries seem excessive in comparison to professions that make significant contributions to the greater good. It is crucial to reassess our priorities and acknowledge the importance of jobs that have a tangible impact, such as those in education, healthcare, and public service. By doing so, we can work towards a fairer compensation system that truly reflects the value created by various professions.
1289;Some people feel that fashion is like art and a significant part of society, while others feel that fashion is a waste of time and money.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"The fashion industry today is an important component of society and people’s lives. It is true that many people care little for clothes and scorn the importance that others attach to them; however, this does not mean that the significance that people give to fashion is a waste of time and money.When one considers that areas of the world suffer from poverty, disease and inadequate access to food and clean water, the emphasis attached to fashion by the developed world can seem out of proportion. Many people would contend that the resources put into developing and creating fashion would be more ethically spent on creating some level of equality in terms of the right to live a healthy and happy life. This point is hard to argue with. However, it is also true that people in the developed world cannot be expected to send all their spending money to people in need and that wanting to look good is an unalterable human trait.The fashion industry contributes to the society much like most other industries. It provides jobs and income to millions of people around the world and the money that changes hands generates taxes that contribute to the fabric of society. There is more to fashion than trying to look better than others and excessive luxury. The high level of fashion is indeed a kind of art form and, like other art forms, there will always be people who appreciate it, want to create it and want to spend money on it. It is part of the development of civilisation and this is not likely to change.I therefore feel that, although the gap between the rich and the poor sometimes makes it seem that fashion is a waste of time and money and an unethical use of resources, fashion is an important part of today’s society and economic output. This leads me to believe that trying to strike a balance between selfish greed and a more altruistic way of living should be an individual choice.";"The discussion surrounding the role of fashion in society has been ongoing, with some people perceiving it as a vital form of art and an essential facet of culture, while others dismiss it as a trivial misuse of time and resources. Proponents of fashion as an art form argue that it serves as a medium for individual creativity and personal expression. Fashion designers are comparable to artists, utilizing fabrics, colors, and textures to craft works that evoke feelings and convey important messages. Moreover, the fashion industry significantly impacts the economy by creating jobs and generating substantial revenue. A prime example is the Met Gala, a notable fashion event that not only celebrates style but also serves as a stage for fundraising and spotlighting social issues.Conversely, detractors argue that fashion is a superficial and materialistic endeavor that prompts individuals to value appearance over substance. They claim that the relentless pursuit of the latest trends fosters needless consumerism and waste, which exacerbates environmental issues and social disparities. Additionally, the fashion industry frequently faces criticism for its shortcomings in diversity and inclusivity, alongside its role in upholding unrealistic beauty standards.From my perspective, fashion represents more than just a mere societal distraction. Although the industry has its shortcomings, I maintain that fashion can serve as a potent means of self-expression, cultural interaction, and social critique. When approached responsibly, fashion has the potential to advocate for sustainability, diversity, and body positivity. Brands like Patagonia and Reformation exemplify this shift toward eco-conscious and ethical practices. Furthermore, fashion has been utilized to raise awareness about pressing social matters, such as the ""Pink Ribbon"" campaign for breast cancer awareness. In summary, despite the legitimate criticisms directed at the fashion industry, I believe its artistic and cultural significance, alongside its capacity for positive social impact, renders it an important and valuable aspect of society."
1294;Some people feel that learning a foreign language is an essential component of a child’s education. Others feel that learning a foreign language is often a waste of time that can be better spent on learning about technology and other more vocational subjects.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Throughout the history of education, learning a foreign language or languages has been a constant component. Of course, many people feel that this is really an unnecessary part of education for everyone, but this is not a point of view that I share.The opponents to learning a foreign language might argue that most people do not travel that often outside their own country. In addition to this, out of all the countries of the world, comparatively not many share the same language. Therefore, learning a foreign language will only be useful for the very limited time that one spends in a country where this language is used. For some people, the language might never be used in their entire lives. When one thinks about how much time and money are spent training language teachers, buying resources, going on trips and delivering lessons for such a negligible benefit, this would seem to be a very inefficient allocation of resources.However, the benefits of learning a foreign language go further than just the ability to use it from time to time on a holiday or business trip. Firstly, through learning one language, one gains an understanding to some extent of how all languages work. Thus, no matter where people might end up around the world, the knowledge of language can be of use. Secondly, with the study of a foreign language, one also opens oneself up to other cultures. This allows in turn an appreciation for different points of view and belief systems. With an ever-shrinking world due to globalisation, the ability to empathise and understand the people from other countries is vital to reducing conflict and creating a more tolerant society. Finally, quite simply learning languages is excellent for the improvement of general cognitive skills.It seems to me that learning a foreign language, therefore, is more than just gaining the ability to speak a few words of a foreign tongue. It is part of intellectual and social development and needs to be continued for everyone in today’s schools.;"The discussion about the significance of foreign language learning in children's education has ignited vigorous debate. Some argue that mastering a foreign language is an essential part of a child's educational experience. They contend that it not only expands their cultural awareness but also enhances their career prospects in an ever-globalizing world. For example, a child fluent in multiple languages can interact effectively with individuals from various backgrounds, fostering international connections and collaborations. Additionally, studies indicate that learning a foreign language can boost cognitive abilities since it engages memory, attention, and problem-solving skills.Conversely, some people believe that learning a foreign language is an inefficient use of time, which could be better allocated to subjects like technology and vocational training. They suggest that in today's digital landscape, where translation apps and artificial intelligence are commonly available, the necessity of learning a foreign language is waning. Furthermore, they argue that disciplines such as coding, computer science, and engineering offer more practical and sought-after skills that can secure a child's future employment.In my view, I firmly believe that learning a foreign language is a vital aspect of a child's education. While technology has indeed progressed significantly, human interaction and cultural exchange remain invaluable in any field. A foreign language is not merely a tool for communication; it serves as a gateway to new cultures, histories, and perspectives. For instance, a student proficient in Spanish can not only engage with Spanish speakers but also appreciate the rich cultural traditions of Spain and Latin America. Moreover, as international cooperation and diplomacy become increasingly crucial, the ability to converse in multiple languages becomes a significant asset. Consequently, I assert that learning a foreign language should be a priority in a child's education, as it can unlock a wealth of experiences, cultures, and opportunities that profoundly shape their future."
1073;Some people feel that the design of newly constructed buildings in big cities should be controlled by governments. Others believe those who finance the construction of a building should be free to design it as they see fit.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is often argued that governments should involve in construction's design in huge cities, while others argued that governments do not have to retrict the free of designers' imagination if those designs are splendid fit on the cities. I believe that if that were to happen, it would be the positive development. This essay will highlight the both views and give personal opinion from the former argument's side.To begin with latter opinion, although governments have worried about the combination of buildings entirely, the strong limitation about design can cause squandering of designers' skills. There are huge number of competitions about designing building in this society, and the evolution in these fields has developed dramatically. However, if there is a strict criteria on design of building, the majority of intelligences do not need to hammer away to come up with revolutional outline for building.On the other hand, signitured design of the big cities by itself can be the purpose of trevelling as a landmark, and it can be followed by significant economical achievement in the country. To take myself as an example, in 2017, I went to Gold Coast for study automotive engineering, and I was stunnied becaused of the atmosphere which is formed by combination of similar buildings and beach. Furthermore, according to the research from Sydney university, Gold Coast is one of the cities which make a fortune because of marvelous view.To sum up with, I would therefore argue that in spite of the fact that building design restriction can influence on architects negatively, it has a potential ability to make a significant profit in the future.;The ongoing debate regarding who should oversee the design of new buildings in major cities has led to a heated discussion. On one side, some advocate for government involvement in building design to preserve aesthetic consistency and ensure that new structures align with the city’s master plan. This approach aims to prevent the erection of unsightly buildings that could disrupt the city’s visual harmony. For example, Paris enforces strict building regulations to maintain its historical charm and character.Conversely, others argue that those financing construction projects should be free to design as they wish. This viewpoint values creativity and innovation in architecture, allowing developers to produce distinctive and iconic buildings that mirror the city’s diversity. A prime example is the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, designed by Frank Gehry, which exemplifies the impact of unrestricted architectural creativity, attracting millions of visitors and enhancing the local economy.In my view, a balanced strategy is essential. Governments should implement regulations to ensure buildings meet safety and environmental standards while also permitting developers the flexibility to exercise their creativity. This could be achieved through adaptable zoning laws and incentives for innovative and sustainable designs. Ultimately, fostering collaboration among governments, developers, and architects can lead to the development of aesthetically pleasing, functional, and sustainable buildings that enrich the urban experience and support the city’s growth. By finding a balance between oversight and creative freedom, cities can evolve into vibrant and dynamic centers that celebrate human ingenuity and advancement.
1292;Some people feel that with the rise of artificial intelligence, computers and robots will take over the roles of teachers. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;With ever increasing technological advances, computers and robots are replacing human roles in different areas of society. This trend can also be seen in education, where interactive programs can enhance the educational experience for children and young adults. Whether, however, this revolution can also take over the role of the teacher completely is debatable, and I oppose this idea as it is unlikely to serve students well.The roles of computers and robots can be seen in many areas of the workplace. Classic examples are car factories, where a lot of the repetitive precision jobs done on assembly lines have been performed by robots for many years, and medicine, where diagnosis, and treatment, including operations, have also been assisted by computers for a long time. According to the media, it won’t also be long until we have cars that are driven automatically.It has long been discussed whether robots and computers can do this in education. It is well known that the complexity of programs can now adapt to so many situations that something can already be set up that has the required knowledge of the teacher, along with the ability to predict and answer all questions that might be asked by students. In fact, due to the nature of computers, the knowledge levels can far exceed a teacher’s and have more breadth, as a computer can have equal knowledge in all the subjects that are taught in school, as opposed to a single teacher’s specialisation. It seems very likely, therefore, that computers and robots should be able to deliver the lessons that teachers can, including various ways of differentiating and presenting materials to suit varying abilities and ages of students.Where I am not convinced is in the pastoral role of teachers. Part of teaching is managing behaviour and showing empathy with students, so that they feel cared for and important. Even if a robot or computer can be programmed to imitate these actions, students will likely respond in a different way when they know an interaction is part of an algorithm rather than based on human emotion.Therefore, although I feel that computers should be able to perform a lot of the roles of teachers in the future, they should be used as educational tools to assist teachers and not to replace them. In this way, students would receive the benefits of both ways of instruction.;"The idea that computers and robots may take over the role of teachers due to the rise of artificial intelligence has ignited considerable discussion. While I acknowledge the concerns surrounding this topic, I largely disagree with the notion. To me, the responsibilities of a teacher go far beyond merely conveying information, which is the main area that AI can mimic.Primarily, teaching encompasses more than just sharing knowledge; it also involves nurturing, guiding, and mentoring students. Human teachers offer emotional support, empathy, and individualized attention, all of which are crucial for a student's comprehensive development. AI, regardless of its sophistication, lacks the emotional intelligence necessary to grasp the subtleties of human feelings and behavior. For example, a teacher can identify when a student is struggling not only academically but also personally, allowing them to provide appropriate support. This tailored approach cannot be matched by current AI technology.Moreover, education relies on intricate interactions like discussions, debates, and collaborative projects, all of which require human intuition, creativity, and critical thinking. Although AI can analyze vast data sets, it cannot replicate the depth and richness of human interactions. The learning journey is highly contextual, and human teachers are better suited to adjust their teaching strategies based on the needs and responses of their students.Additionally, human teachers play a significant role in fostering skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and ethical decision-making. These abilities extend beyond simply processing information; they involve understanding the implications, questioning assumptions, and considering various perspectives. Such tasks demand a level of human judgment and experience that AI systems are not equipped to deliver.In summary, while artificial intelligence will certainly enhance education by offering personalized learning materials, streamlining administrative tasks, and providing real-time feedback, it is improbable that it will completely supplant human teachers. The core of teaching is rooted in human qualities—empathy, interaction, and the capacity to inspire and motivate—all of which set human educators apart. Therefore, the role of AI in education should be viewed as a means to support and enhance teachers’ capabilities rather than replace them."
1285;Some people like to own the place where they live, but other people like to rent where they live. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The debate over whether it is better to own or rent the property in which one lives is one that has strong supporters on each side. There are persuasive arguments for both points of view.One of the main advantages of renting a property is flexibility. Usually, a tenant only has to give a month’s notice before changing where he or she lives. If a property is owned and a change is needed, the property must be put onto the market and it is frequently a long and stressful process to get a sale completed. Sometimes, the wrong time of year or a bad market can mean that a sale is not possible. Another advantage of renting is that a large amount of a family’s capital is not tied up in the property. Property can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and often a lot more. If one rents, this money can be spent on other things to help improve the family’s quality of life. If the property is on a mortgage, then the deposit, also often very large, is tied up in the property and the pressure of having to make substantial payments every month can cause a lot of stress.Owning a property does have various advantages, though. Even though people usually have to service a mortgage every month with payments, this money is then built up with the property. With renting, the money is lost to the landlord, but at the end of the term of the mortgage, the whole property is owned by the family. This makes the process of living in a property a type of investment. In addition, the property’s value often goes up after time, frequently creating a substantial profit. Owning the property where one lives can also create a sense of well-being and self-actualisation.The decision to whether one rents or owns the property in which one lives really boils down to individual preference. My opinion is that it is much more preferable to own a property, mainly because it creates a valuable asset for the family.;The discussion surrounding the choice between owning or renting a home has persisted for many years, with each option presenting its own set of pros and cons. On one hand, homeownership offers a feeling of stability and permanence, enabling individuals to establish roots and make substantial investments in their property. For example, homeowners have the freedom to make alterations and enhancements without needing permission from a landlord, granting them a sense of independence and authority over their living environment. Additionally, real estate can serve as a significant asset that may appreciate over time, potentially allowing for a financial cushion in the future.Conversely, renting provides a level of flexibility and freedom that allows people to relocate without being constrained to one place. Renters are not accountable for maintenance and repair expenses, which can sometimes impose a considerable financial burden. For instance, a renter can easily move to a new city for job opportunities or personal reasons without the hassle of selling a home or managing the complexities of remote property ownership. Furthermore, renting can be a more budget-friendly alternative, particularly for those who may not be prepared to commit to a long-term mortgage.In my view, renting is the more practical and appealing choice, especially for younger individuals or those who prioritize flexibility. Given the rising cost of living and the unpredictable job market, renting offers a degree of freedom and adaptability that often isn't available with owning a home. Additionally, the funds that would typically go toward a down payment and mortgage could be better utilized in other investments, such as a retirement account or a small business. However, for those who are ready to settle down and have a secure financial foundation, owning a property can indeed be a worthwhile and fulfilling investment. Ultimately, the decision to rent or own hinges on personal circumstances and priorities.
1405;Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding changes. Others, however think that change is always a good thing. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;Nowadays, people are arguing whether an ideal lifestyle should be a stable one or should it include a wide ranges of changes.In my opinion, whether changes are needed should be determined the of you are at.Apparently, are favorable the development of young people, in to their careers. Primarily, an abundant experience in varieties of jobs enables the young to master a broad range of techniques and skills, leading to significant edge over counterparts in the competition for employment. Meanwhile, trying various roles in life and work provides wide of lifestyles for the young in the future. Only after this comparison can they realize what the real goals of their .However, other than frequent changes, the elderly who have undergone all these challenges may pursue a steady lifestyle. For the elders, concentration on their favorite activities would give rise to a sense of enjoyment and security, which is helpful to physical and psychological health. Due to a stable life, the elderly are less exposed to stress, leading to a decrease in adrenal hormones and resulting in their well-.Furthermore, degeneration of mental and physical function would make the elderly unlikely to adapt to external changes, causing and , which are not contributing to their health.Above all, it is unlikely to describe the changes in life with a positive or negative term. Accommodation for personal needs and goals is more important than the changes themselves.;The discussion about the value of change in life has ignited passionate conversations among people. On one side, there are those who prefer to stick to a routine and resist change as it offers a sense of stability and security. This mindset allows them to establish a solid foundation and build on familiar practices, which helps minimize uncertainty and anxiety. For example, someone in a steady job might choose to remain in their current position because it ensures a reliable income and a clear understanding of their duties.Conversely, there are individuals who advocate for change as a positive force, believing that it brings fresh experiences, new opportunities, and fosters personal growth. Embracing change encourages people to leave their comfort zones, push their boundaries, and uncover new facets of their identities. It can also stimulate innovation, enhance problem-solving abilities, and broaden perspectives. For instance, traveling to different countries or pursuing a new hobby can introduce individuals to varied cultures, ideas, and ways of thinking, enriching their lives in the process.In my view, finding a balance between stability and change is crucial for a fulfilling life. While some level of routine and predictability is necessary for emotional and financial well-being, too much rigidity can lead to stagnation and monotony. On the other hand, relentless change can feel overwhelming and stressful. Thus, it’s important to find a middle ground that allows individuals to enjoy stability while also welcoming new experiences and challenges. By doing so, people can navigate life’s complexities with confidence, adaptability, and an eagerness to learn and grow. Ultimately, a balanced approach to change and stability is essential for leading a happy, engaging, and meaningful life.
1423;Some people say education is the only critical factor to the development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;One the one hand good education is a highly recommended skill in the developed countries, on the other hand of many people in regions of poverty. But what makes education key factor for the development of a countryWe must acknowledge that education is something that we all need. The differences are just what we learn. Mostly the limited educational horizons of poor and less educated people have more to deal with their personal situation than with problems of bigger effects on a country. Attending school is sometimes too expensive and it does not feed a family.Nevertheless there must be a reason for education. For me it looks like some countries have realized that Education is the key for the globalization process. If we take India for example we can see that a change in the educational system had changed the economy of the country. country has changed from a poor region to a high potential for IT knowledge.In regard to this fact of education seriously and offer it to a wide range of people. Spending money education is the key tippy title=”for”]to[/tippy] a new future effects on the economy and social life. All in all I agree with the importance of education for the development of a country. Less knowledge leads to poverty and . Learning and Knowledge is Power and an investment in the near future and therefore it has to be an official task.;The assertion that education is the sole critical factor in a country’s development is one that has ignited considerable debate among scholars and policymakers. Although education undeniably plays a pivotal role in national development, I fundamentally disagree with the idea that it is the only essential element.Education is, without a doubt, vital for promoting economic growth, social advancement, and political stability. A well-educated populace is better prepared to enter the workforce, foster innovation, and engage in informed decision-making. Education equips individuals with the skills and knowledge required to participate effectively in the global economy, thereby propelling a nation's progress. Additionally, educated individuals are more likely to be active in the democratic process, contributing to a more informed and involved citizenry.However, many other factors are equally significant, if not more so, in shaping a country's development. For example, infrastructure, including roads, transportation systems, and communication networks, plays a crucial role in enabling trade, commerce, and the exchange of ideas. A stable and efficient political system, a strong healthcare system, and a conducive business environment are also vital aspects of a nation's development. Moreover, access to essential resources such as clean water, sanitation, and energy is crucial for the health and productivity of a nation's population.In summary, while education is indeed an important aspect of a country’s development, it is far from being the only critical factor. The development of a nation is a complex and multifaceted process that requires a combination of educated citizens, strong infrastructure, effective governance, and access to vital resources. Therefore, it's essential to adopt a comprehensive approach to development that acknowledges the interactions among these various elements, rather than viewing education as the sole engine of progress.
87;Some people say free time activities for children should be organized by parents. Others say that children should be free to choose what they do in their free time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Whether parents should fully intervene in their children's organization of their leisure time or let them decide it, remains a big discussion. In this essay I will contrast the two opinions and I will explain why I think a good balance is needed.One of the reasons supporting the first view is the idea of the undeveloped children's ability to organize. This is because, although some of them might seem very mature for their age, others might struggle understanding the importance of having a routine, besides playing video games. For instance, many parents orientate their children helping them to organize hobbies and teaching a very important skill, time managment.On the other hand, some people encourage children to decide themselves what to do as this stimulates creativity and personal growth. This view, therefore, opens a new world for the little ones who can decide whatever they like, having multiple options. For example, children in this situation quite often are supported when they want to play sports or participate in a painting class.In my opinion, parents should not only be envolved as much as they can in all aspects of their children's lives, but also they might encourage the little ones to have personal opinions and decision about their hobbies and leisure actitivities. This may be a good way to build trust and communication between parents and children. Moreover, children learn responsability while being guided by their parents.In conclusion, some parents help their children more in scheduling their free time, while others intervene less leaving them to create a routine freely. I believe, parents should always be involved in their children's lives and decisions, allowing children participation too, which brings multiple benefits to their relationship.;The discussion about how children ought to spend their leisure time has ignited a vigorous dialogue among parents and specialists. Some argue in favor of parents arranging activities for their children, asserting that such structure fosters a sense of security. Engaging in organized pursuits, like sports or music classes, not only helps children acquire valuable skills but also allows them to connect with their peers. This method can also guarantee that children are involved in safe, supervised environments, protecting them from potential dangers.Conversely, others contend that children should have the liberty to choose how they spend their free time, enabling them to pursue their interests and cultivate independence. Unstructured leisure time encourages creativity, decision-making, and learning from failures. It also offers them a chance to unwind and recharge, which is vital for their mental and physical health. An overly rigid schedule can lead to stress and burnout, which may diminish the advantages of extracurricular activities.In my view, it is essential to strike a balance between these two perspectives. While organized activities can have their benefits, allowing children the freedom to make choices and discover their passions is equally important. This approach can aid in developing their sense of responsibility, independence, and self-drive. Ultimately, parents must recognize the unique needs of their children and find a suitable compromise. By blending structure with freedom, parents can nurture their children into happy, confident, and well-rounded individuals.
1330;Some people say that all popular TV entertainment programmes should aim to educate viewers about important social issues. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It is often said that all influential TV entertainment programs should be geared towards raising people’s awareness about social issues that matter. While some TV programs could be suitable for this purpose, I disagree with the view that it should be mandatory for all of them, as the decision whether to do so must take into account the nature of the TV content and the channel’s audience.There is a large group of professionals who would benefit from deepening their understanding of what is happening in the world. Stock traders and bankers, for example, must always keep track of numerous business trends on a global scale, and they would appreciate this type of information on their favourite TV shows. Young people are another suitable audience due to the fact that they enjoy learning about popular topics from TV programmes. For instance, SDGs or the Sustainable Development Goals has now become an important topic to learn for children at school. Educational TV would provide a welcome alternative to textbooks, making learning more fun.Despite the potential advantages of incorporating educational content in TV programs, it is important to remember that the purpose of entertainment TV is for people to escape reality, to take a break from their hectic lives. Being reminded about some troubling social issues would not be appreciated by those who just want to unwind after a long day at work. Another consideration is how the content is perceived by the audience, because broadcasting serious topics as part of a comedy show might lead some viewers to believe they are of lesser significance. This would make TV shows of light-hearted nature a poor choice for inclusion of content on pressing social issues.In conclusion, entertainment TV programs can be an effective form of education for some people and a great tool to spread information. However, not all of them should be used for this purpose as there are various ways people appreciate them.;The idea that popular television entertainment should focus on educating audiences about significant social issues has ignited a spirited discussion. While some believe these programs have a duty to inform and raise awareness, I only partially concur with this view.On one hand, the influence of popular TV shows on their viewers is substantial. With millions of people watching daily, these programs can shape public opinion and impact cultural norms. By integrating social issues into their narratives, they can highlight critical topics such as racism, sexism, and environmental challenges. This approach can foster a more informed and compassionate audience, which is crucial for building a fairer and more equitable society.On the other hand, the primary purpose of popular TV entertainment is to provide enjoyment, not education. Audiences tune in to unwind and have fun, not to receive lectures. If every show were to prioritize educating viewers about social issues, it could result in reduced viewership and diminished credibility. Additionally, other formats, like documentaries and news programs, are often more effective at delivering educational content regarding social issues.In summary, while I believe that popular TV entertainment can contribute to raising awareness about social issues, I do not consider it should be its main objective. A balance between entertainment and education is important, with shows addressing social issues in a manner that feels natural and respectful to their viewers. By achieving this balance, they can promote awareness without sacrificing their entertainment value.
1353;Some people say that arts subjects are as essential as academic ones and should be part of school syllabus (agree/disagree);"Some people say that art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are an essential part of education, and every school should include them in its syllabus. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your opinion and examples from your own experience.Art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are fundamentals that enrich our lives. However, some parents say schools on teaching more academic subjects, such as mathematics, science, literature and history. In my opinion, both academic and arts subjects should be taught and I will expand on the pros and cons of including arts in the school program further on in this essay.On the one hand, academic subjects are often required when we get into higher . Academic subjects may be considered as in the academic world. Personally, I have never taken an entrance exam of art subjects for high school or university. In other words, schools measured my academic abilities using academic subjects, not art subjects. To suit the current educational system, many parents in my home country, Japan, send their children to cram schools to study academic subjects deeply.On the other hand, art subjects can strengthen the creativity and flexibility of individuals. Liberal arts, which include cultural understanding and knowledge, also include other arts subjects. In addition, we are living in the era of automation and artificial intelligence which are replacing human labor and office work more and more. In this regard, human creativity becomes more important. Therefore, art subjects are being more in demand to make a difference between individuals and computers.In conclusion, academic and arts subjects should blend in a school syllabus in a balanced way. Art subjects can also a better personality in individuals, so participation in these classes should be encouraged as well as academic achievements.The writer explored the reasons why including arts subjects in school syllabus is a good idea, while fluently expressing ideas and supporting them by examples. Correct paragraphing assists with orderly presentation of information, making this essay easy to follow; the range of vocabulary is quite wide. Accuracy of expression needs a bit more attention (see corrections underlined in blue), but overall, this essay could achieve IELTS Band 8.";The significance of arts subjects in education has long been a subject of discussion. Some argue that they are less important than traditional academic subjects, but I strongly believe that they hold equal importance and should be included in the school curriculum. Subjects such as music, dance, and visual arts offer students a valuable outlet for creative expression and imaginative development.Integrating arts subjects into the educational framework can yield numerous advantages for students. For example, it can enhance their cognitive abilities, including memory and focus, as well as boost critical thinking skills. In addition, the arts can nurture creativity, bolster self-confidence, and encourage self-expression, all of which are vital life skills. Moreover, engaging with the arts allows students to discover their talents and interests, leading to a more enriched and purposeful life.Additionally, participation in arts programs can positively influence students' academic achievements. Studies indicate that students involved in the arts often excel in core subjects like math and reading. This improvement can be attributed to the development of important skills such as problem-solving, hand-eye coordination, and spatial awareness—abilities essential for academic success.In summary, I wholeheartedly believe that arts subjects are just as important as academic disciplines and must be integrated into the school curriculum. They offer a multitude of benefits, from enhancing cognitive skills to fostering creativity and individual expression. By prioritizing the arts in education, we can cultivate well-rounded, imaginative, and self-assured individuals ready to thrive in various aspects of life. Thus, it is crucial for schools to emphasize the importance of arts subjects and provide opportunities for students to explore their creative potential.
779;Some people say that modern technology has made shopping today easier, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion;It is commonly argued that the fast pacing technology has helped people do shopping at the present time more easily. However, some people think online shopping is really difficult for them. This essay will consider both the advantages and disadvantages of the use of technology for shopping.One disadvantage of online shopping can be mentioned is that people cannot familiarize themselves with online applications for ordering essential goods and food. In fact, the elderly are not good at technology enough to go to virtual supermarkets. Besides, those who live in remote areas are not accessible easily to technology to buy online groceries.Despite its disadvantage, online shopping has brought about advantages for those who are technology natives. Firstly, it can be time-saving. In fact, shoppers can order any things they need with some clicks on the items, payment method, and time of delivery. Especially in a lingering Covid-19, when social distancing measures have been effective in some places in Viet Nam, according to a survey, the number of online shoppers has been increasing day by day, and thus many applications have been into existence, developed, and thrived.Another advantage of virtual shopping is that it can be life-saving to many people in a pandemic across nations. Going to supermarkets can be detrimental to buyers due to the spread of viruses and the higher risk of infection. For example, in order to buy bread for breakfast, people have to go out for it and thus may be exposed to infectious or incubated victims of Covid-19. Moreover, with preventive measures of Covid-19 containment, such as people not being allowed to go out for their essential goods, if they do not know how to make an online order, it is really difficult for them to survive during a pandemic.In conclusion, the use of technology for virtual shopping is beneficial to our time-saving and life-saving matters, though it is not familiar to some people. In my opinion, thanks to its advantages, I will continue to go shopping online, though the world has gone through the Covid-19 pandemic successfully.;The introduction of modern technology has fundamentally changed how people shop, igniting discussions about its effects on the shopping experience. Supporters of this technological shift argue that shopping has become significantly easier. With the growth of e-commerce, consumers have the ability to browse and purchase items from the comfort of their own homes, around the clock. Online shopping platforms provide a vast selection of products, competitive pricing, and convenient delivery options, allowing individuals to shop without the need to physically visit stores. Moreover, mobile applications and digital payment systems have simplified the checkout process, cutting down on wait times and reducing reliance on cash and credit cards.Conversely, there are those who highlight the negative aspects of modern technology in the shopping realm. For example, online shopping can lead to disappointment when items don't match their online descriptions or when there are delays in delivery. Additionally, the absence of face-to-face interaction and personalized customer service can render online shopping a more impersonal and solitary experience. Some individuals also contend that the relentless flood of ads and promotions on social media and online platforms can be overwhelming, adding stress to the shopping process.In my view, modern technology has undeniably made shopping easier and more convenient. Despite certain drawbacks, the advantages of online shopping—such as flexibility, accessibility, and comfort—far outweigh the negatives. Moreover, many retailers are embracing technology to enhance in-store experiences, employing tools like augmented reality to allow customers to virtually try on products. All in all, modern technology has reshaped the shopping landscape, providing consumers with unprecedented choices, convenience, and flexibility.
1401;Some people say that the Internet is making the world smaller by bringing people together. To what extent do you agree that the internet is making it easier for people to communicate with one another?;In today’s world due to the advancement of technology new inventions are coming into existence. It is true that ‘Necessity is a mother of invention’. Internet is just like a wonder box, which contains every type of information. it has also proved a very important tool to connect people with one another.In today’s modernized era nobody has sufficient time to write letters to their loved ones. it also takes longer to send or receive any informationthe Internet is the easiest way to send messages to our loved ones. Communication can be either in the form of e-mail or through text messages sent via to mobile phones. We can send and receive messages straight .today’s young generation mostly prefers to do chatting through the Internet. During such chatting we can write messages and get replies straight away. voice chatting is .the advantages and disadvantages resemble two sides of one coin, also some downsides, causing people health problems poor eye-sight, back ache or migraines. Today’s teenagers usually prefer to spend their time on the internet rather than in other physical activities, which causing them to have a weaker physical health.To conclude, I would like to say that the Internet is one of the most modernized and most successful tools, not only for regarding every field in a very short period of time.;The rise of the internet has fundamentally transformed how individuals interact with one another. I firmly believe that it has significantly simplified communication, effectively shrinking the world.Firstly, the internet has eliminated geographical barriers, allowing people to connect with others across the globe. Social media, email, and messaging applications enable interactions across various time zones and locations, making it possible for individuals to nurture relationships, form new friendships, and explore business opportunities internationally. For example, someone in the United States can effortlessly reach out to a counterpart in Japan or Australia, fostering global connections and networks.Moreover, the internet has promoted communication among individuals with common interests and hobbies. Online forums, discussion groups, and blogs have established platforms for sharing ideas, exchanging information, and collaborating on projects. As a result, individuals can connect with others who share their passions, irrespective of where they are located. Additionally, the internet provides access to information and resources from anywhere, enhancing global understanding and facilitating knowledge sharing.In summary, the internet has undeniably streamlined communication, bringing people closer together. The myriad advantages of online communication, including worldwide connectivity, information access, and collaborative opportunities, have made it an essential tool in contemporary life. As the internet continues to advance, its influence on global communication is poised to expand even further, creating an increasingly interconnected world.
727;Some people say that the experiences a child has before starting school have the most influence on their future life. Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. Discuss both views and give your own opinion?;There are a lot of research about development in human life, Some people say that the experiences a child has before starting school have the most influence on their future life. Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. In the following paragraph, I will discuss both view and give my opinion.On the one hands, There has a research that bad experience in children before begining at school, especcially in family, will become unforgettable deep heart. For example, Children who live with strict parents and has aggressive punishment when children doing littie wrong things. In the future, Children will tend to aggressive and feeling they has not received a love from family. This research surely reasonnable because family is an important factor of social life.On the other hands, There have an opinion even if children was velvet glove when raised with family. However, Especially in adolescent, Friend and teacher can infleuence as same as family because teenagers spend more time at school that with family as a reason learning in classroom more than primary school and have a more group work with friend. Thus, If teenager prefer to close with a good student (not smoking or drinking alcohol / invite classroom friends travel education museum in weekends or holiday), Parents can make sure that your child will mature to standard adults.In conclusion, In my opinion, Children would be infleuenced by family before begining at school. After that, They will has a lot of complex relationship in school from friends and teachers that can infleuences children. So, Children should try to control yourself in moral to be a best quality adults.;The discussion surrounding which stage of life exerts the greatest influence on an individual's future has ignited considerable debate. Some contend that the formative experiences a child encounters before entering school are pivotal, while others assert that the teenage years, particularly those spent in an educational setting, are more crucial. In this essay, I will explore both viewpoints and share my perspective.On one side, the early years of a child's life are essential in shaping their future trajectories. The experiences they have prior to beginning school, such as the nurturing environment at home and their relationships with family members, establish the groundwork for their social, emotional, and cognitive growth. For instance, children raised in a caring and supportive atmosphere are more likely to cultivate a robust sense of self-worth and confidence, which can have positive implications for their later life. Furthermore, studies indicate that early childhood experiences can significantly influence brain development, ultimately affecting a child's capacity to learn and achieve in school.Conversely, the experiences teenagers go through, especially in school, can also deeply affect their future lives. The adolescent years are marked by considerable physical, emotional, and social transformations, with experiences during this period playing a critical role in shaping one’s identity, values, and aspirations. For instance, a teenager encouraged to engage in extracurricular activities or sports may acquire vital life skills such as collaboration, discipline, and resilience. Moreover, the connections they form with peers and educators can significantly impact their academic achievements, career decisions, and overall well-being.In my view, both sides present valid arguments, and it is challenging to highlight a single life stage as the most influential. However, I believe that the experiences children have prior to school create a foundational base for future success, whereas the experiences encountered during the teenage years, particularly in educational settings, build upon this foundation and help define their specific paths in life. Ultimately, a combination of enriching early childhood experiences and a nurturing teenage environment can offer individuals the best possible beginnings.
337;Some people think history has nothing or little to tell us, but others think that studying the past history can help us better understand the present. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;With the development of technology, an increasing number of people try to acquire the latest technology such as computer programming, rather than to study history. There is a debate whether studying histroy could give us more advantages to understand the present society. In my opinion, obtaining knowledge of past history would be definitely helpful for us to live well in society today. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.To begin with, looking back on history would give us the opportunity to notice mistakes which human beings used to make in the past. Specifically, all kinds of people and countries around the world had made innumerable mistakes throughout history. Besides, some of these mistakes might result in a huge number of victims. Therefore, human beings must avoid these tragedic events happening again. Above all, only knowing history could lead to avoidance of the recurrences. To be more specific, World War must be one of the serious events in human being history, and understanding of this truth have a significant impact on how we should live not to cause war again in the present society. It is manifest that leaning history is meaningful in this regard.On the other hand, some arguments can be made that old stories have little something to do with our present lives. However, closer examination would reveal that all the relationships present today originally come from something in the past. Knowing history enables us to find the best way to a fruitful future. The compelling example of this is racial discrimination in the U.S. Understanding the U.S. history could give us the best manner not to deteriorate relationships in the U.S. I suppose that studying history would be helpful for all human beings from this aspect.Having considered all the arguments above, learning history would be a major contributor to a better understanding of the present because we can know how to avoid the same mistake people used to made and how we should behave for the better result through history.;The importance of studying history has sparked considerable debate, with some arguing that it holds little relevance in today's world, while others contend it is vital for understanding our current circumstances. Those who dismiss the significance of history often view it as merely a record of unchangeable past events. They argue that concentrating on history detracts from addressing urgent contemporary issues and future challenges. Additionally, they contend that historical context is frequently subjective and open to various interpretations, which undermines its reliability as a tool for comprehending the present.Conversely, many advocates for studying history argue that it is essential for comprehending the intricacies of modern life. History offers invaluable lessons on the evolution of societies, cultures, and governments, shedding light on the repercussions of past choices and actions. By analyzing historical events, we can uncover recurring patterns and causes that continue to influence today's world. For example, knowledge of past global conflicts can guide diplomatic initiatives and policy formulation, while insights from previous economic downturns can aid in averting future crises. Moreover, history serves to preserve cultural heritage and societal traditions, enriching our appreciation of diverse perspectives and experiences.In my view, studying history is crucial for making sense of the present. The past and present are deeply interconnected, as historical events and trends continue to shape current issues. Ignoring history risks repeating past errors and missing lessons from the achievements and failures of those who came before us. Thus, I assert that history has much to impart, and its examination should be promoted and valued as a means of navigating the complexities of today's world.
411;Some people think students should study the science of food and how to prepare it. Others think that school time should be used in learning important subjects. Discuss both views and give your opinion?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;These days a portion of the society consider that students must learn the subject of cooking food and ways to make meals meanwhile, a group of people think that educational institutions shall be used to study more essential courses. I strongly agree that schools should be used for learning far important subjects rather than cooking classes. In this essay a im going to examin and discuss both phenomenon viewpoints and draw my personal opinion.In one hand, some people think that cooking and food subjects should be an important courses in schools,in addition, the steps of preparing meals and information about food may help students for a healthy lifestyle.On the other hand, a group of individuals consider that cooking is a hobby and cooking classes must be optional to the student and not requiered for all students, to illustrate even more, a bigger portion of students may not be interested in cooking as others,whereas, schools must be used for more serious purposes ,for example, studying more complicated courses will have a positive effect on the students academic outcomes ,meanwhile, adding courses such as cooking might effect the students time manegement and influence their ability to focus on the important things,for further explaination, if they have a test or different assignments deadlines they should be really focusing on that rather than attending cooking classes.In conclustion, and after analysis of both penomenon i presonally believe that cooking classes should not be considered as an essential course for students in educational institutions.;The discussion over whether cooking and food science should be part of school curricula has ignited passionate debate. Supporters argue that students should invest their time in understanding food science and cooking methods, asserting that culinary skills are crucial for leading a healthy, independent life. They contend that by exploring nutrition, food safety, and meal preparation, students can gain essential life skills that will serve them well in the future. For example, a student skilled in cooking can make knowledgeable dietary choices, fostering a healthier lifestyle.Conversely, some believe that educational time should be focused on core subjects like mathematics, language, and science. They maintain that these subjects provide a robust foundation for future academic and career achievements. According to this perspective, time spent on cooking and food science could be more effectively allocated to core academic areas that are vital for intellectual growth. For instance, a student who excels in math and science may be better positioned to pursue careers in engineering or medicine.From my viewpoint, both perspectives have valid points, but I tend to support the inclusion of food science and cooking in the curriculum. In a world increasingly affected by obesity and diet-related illnesses, educating students about nutrition and cooking could significantly influence their well-being. Additionally, cooking can serve as a dynamic and enjoyable way to teach mathematical concepts like measurements and fractions, creating a valuable connection to academic learning. By integrating cooking and food science into education, teachers can offer students a well-rounded experience that equips them for a healthy, autonomous, and prosperous future.
59;Some people think that governments should ban dangerous sports, while others think people should have freedom to do any sports or activity. Discuss both views and give your own opinion;From the known history of the humanity, many sports or activities have been done to enjoy ourselfs, keeping in shape, or spent time. Grown up people should be free to do any kind of sports or activities by their will unless they are not hurting anyone else except theirselfs.Some people think when a citizen hurt his/herself, tax payers need to pay for the health care fees, and it should not be consern for the tax payers since they are paying only for fundamental situations. This point of view is not matching with the freedom. Yes, there might be a fee for tax payers, yet freedom should be above on all fees. While some people prefers less dangerous activities, others can be interested in more dangerous activities, as well.Governments can have some precautions to make citizens' life better. Yet, they should not involve such things like banning sports since it is the preference of the people which dealing with the dangerous sports. Some people could want to make more unique or exciting sports, and it is quite natural. Banning such kind of activities can be considered as limiting people's freedom.Since most of the people living together for a quite time in a society, people should pay respect on each others preferences, unless it is not interesting other people's personal area. As a calm and relax person, I am not intend to make dangerous sports or activities. However, I do not think that I have the right or power to say other people what should they do or not, and vice versa.;"The ongoing debate over whether governments should prohibit dangerous sports or uphold individuals' freedom to engage in any activity has ignited considerable discussion. On one side, some argue that it is the government's duty to safeguard its citizens from harm, which justifies banning sports that carry significant risks. This stance is rooted in the belief that the government should ensure public safety and prevent needless injuries or fatalities. For example, activities like big wave surfing, rock climbing, and street luging are notoriously perilous, and their prohibition could potentially save lives.Conversely, others contend that individuals ought to have the right to choose their own activities, even if they are labeled as ""dangerous."" This viewpoint emphasizes personal autonomy and suggests that people should be empowered to make decisions regarding the risks they are willing to accept. Advocates for this position argue that banning certain sports would represent an excessive expansion of government authority and could hinder innovation and progress in these areas. Additionally, many high-risk sports offer valuable benefits such as character development, discipline, and physical fitness, which could be forfeited if such activities were prohibited.In my view, while it is vital for the government to protect its citizens, an outright ban on dangerous sports is not the solution. Rather, governments should focus on implementing more stringent safety regulations, improving safety gear, and ensuring that participants receive proper training and are fully informed about the associated risks. This approach strikes a balance between the need for protection and the preservation of personal freedom and autonomy. Ultimately, individuals should have the right to make their own choices about the activities they pursue, provided they are aware of the potential dangers and take appropriate measures to mitigate harm. By seeking a compromise, we can promote both safety and freedom, enabling individuals to chase their passions while also shielding them from unnecessary risks."
1325;Some people think that hosting an international sporting event is beneficial for a country, while others disagree. Do the advantages of hosting a major sporting event outweigh its disadvantages?;International sporting events are well-known for attracting a high level of attention because they give many people something to look forward to. Understandably, there are advantages and disadvantages for the host country, and careful consideration is required to determine whether a nation will benefit or lose from hosting a major sports championship.Worryingly, the new infrastructure required for hosting a major sporting event often comes at the expense of local people. Their lives get disrupted by construction works and at times residents have even been evicted from their homes for stadiums to be built. Worse still, practice shows the expensive, gigantic buildings constructed for the sports event aren’t being used afterwards and fall into disrepair, leaving the country with high maintenance bills. The financial burden from hosting the Olympic Games, for example, is staggering and can run into tens of billions. Still, the question remains whether or not the pros outnumber the cons.It is hard to underestimate the amount of influence on the country’s global status and prestige that comes with becoming a home to an international sporting event. New trade opportunities appear on the horizon, as it happened for many countries that hosted the Olympic Games. There is also a welcome increase in tourism, which gives the local economy a boost, injecting billions of dollars into the national budget. Construction of new stadiums, hotels and infrastructure such as new roads and rail links creates new jobs, further improving the country’s economy. Less tangible but still important is the aspect of national pride and the feel-good factor associated with hosting an international sports event.All in all, it seems to me that an international sporting event can bring more good than harm to a country, especially if its potential dangers can be avoided or minimised. Hosting a World Championship is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a country and an immense source of pride for its citizens.;The debate over whether hosting an international sporting event is advantageous for a country has become quite intense. Some individuals believe that the benefits of such events surpass their drawbacks, while others hold a contrasting viewpoint. This essay will explore both perspectives and share my own opinion.On one side, there are several potential advantages to hosting a major sporting event. For example, it can significantly boost tourism, generate employment, and drive economic growth. The arrival of visitors and athletes can facilitate cultural exchange and highlight the nation's distinct heritage. Additionally, such events can inspire a sense of pride and unity among citizens, fostering a community spirit and shared identity.Conversely, there are noteworthy disadvantages to consider. The financial burden of hosting a large-scale event can be tremendously high, necessitating major investments in infrastructure like stadiums, transportation, and accommodations. These costs may siphon resources away from crucial public services, such as healthcare and education. Moreover, the event can cause disruptions to daily life, leading to increased traffic congestion and noise.In my view, the benefits of hosting a major sporting event do indeed outweigh the drawbacks. Although the financial implications are considerable, the long-term advantages, such as heightened tourism and economic development, can significantly enrich the nation's future. Furthermore, with thorough planning and effective management, the negative impacts can be alleviated. Ultimately, hosting an international sporting event presents a valuable opportunity for a country to enhance its global presence while uniting its citizens in a shared experience of joy and pride.
575;Some people think that hosting international sports events may be beneficial for a country. Discuss both views.;Certain people believe that organizing international sports competitions could benefit host countries. While hosting sport events might also entail risks, I firmly believe that nations would gain much more than they would lose, as I will explain below.International sport competitions are usually large events that bring together thousands of people including athletes, staff, and tourists. This usually represents an attractive opportunity for local business and investors. People need to be fed, thus activating restaurants' economy. Additionally, they need a place to sleep and rest, which would benefit hotels. On the other hand, many countries hosting international competitions build new infrastructure, including stadiums, pools, public squares, and even airports. It is clear that several cities around the world have developed as a result of hosting such events. Let us take the example of the city Montreal in Canada, which hosted the olympic games a few decades ago. Organizing sports events also represents an opportunitty to improve the international image of a country. For example, it is not a secret that some countries such as Germany and Russia have used the World Cup to improve their international image, with positive results overall. Finally, since inhabitants of the host nation would feel inspired to practice a new sport, we could argue that competitions could additionally improve the health and wellbeing of citizens in the long term.It is important to mention, however, that hosting sport events might also entail some risks. These competitions are usually complex and expensive to organize, and middle- or low-income economies could better use their resources to build vital infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools. Moreover, examples around the world illustrate that some politicians see these events as an opportunity for curruption.In conclusion, there are more benefits than risks for countries when it comes to hosting international sport events. These events might translate into economic opportunities for local business and investors, could bring new infrastructure, and may trigger development.;The hosting of international sports events has ignited a lively discussion, with opinions divided on whether it benefits a country or not. Proponents argue that such events can be advantageous, citing various benefits for the host nation. For example, these events often lead to a surge in tourism, as large numbers of spectators and athletes visit, significantly boosting the local economy. Additionally, the infrastructure improvements made for the event—such as stadiums and transport systems—can have a lasting impact, improving residents' quality of life and paving the way for future development.Conversely, critics contend that the costs of hosting international sports events often outweigh the advantages. Building venues and facilities demands substantial financial investment, which can siphon off funds from vital public services like healthcare and education. Moreover, while the event may be brief, the economic repercussions and debts incurred could burden the host country for years. There’s also the disruption to everyday life, characterized by traffic issues and heightened security, which can pose significant challenges.In summary, while hosting international sports events can certainly offer economic and infrastructural opportunities, it is essential to thoroughly assess these benefits against potential financial and social drawbacks. A thoughtful approach that weighs both immediate rewards and long-term implications is crucial for any nation considering such an endeavor. Ultimately, decisions about hosting should prioritize the well-being and interests of the country's citizens.
1017;Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Whilie some people believe that we can live with climate change instead of dealing with that, I don't agree with this idea because climate change can bring various disadvantages for our life.There are many disadvantages of climate change which can gradually push animals and also human to extinction. First and foremost, climate change promote the process of global warming which is one of the most dangerous result of climate change. Because of this situation, ice in 2 polar areas is melting day by day. As a result, the level of sea water will go up. Therefore, countries which are near by the sea may be drown in the future. Another drawback of climate change is that it causes many disaster. The figure for disaster is predicted to increase because of climate change. Hence, people and animals will have to deal with many dangerous disaster which can bring a lot of damage.Beside, I believe there are also many way to prevent climate change. Firstly, from my perspective, education is the best way to deal with the changing of climate. Because education raises the awareness of people about how dangerous climate change is, and it also teach people to protect the environment. Therefore, the effect of climate change will decrease. Secondly, local community should hold more volunteer activity for people to clean the palace where they live, so people can make sense of environmental protection and their neighborhood will also be cleaned. This activity can also contribute to prevent climate changeIn conclusion, I believe that people can't live with climate change and people have to prevent it.;The idea that we should shift our focus from preventing climate change to adapting to it has ignited a vigorous debate. While some advocate for embracing adaptation as a practical response to inevitable climate consequences, I find myself partially agreeing with this viewpoint.On one hand, adaptation is undeniably important, particularly for communities already facing the harsh realities of climate change. For example, coastal cities are making significant investments in sea walls and resilient infrastructure to counteract the effects of rising sea levels. Similarly, nations susceptible to drought are implementing innovative irrigation techniques and cultivating drought-resistant crops to secure food supplies. These initiatives are vital for safeguarding lives and livelihoods amid climate unpredictability.Conversely, I firmly believe that prevention should be our foremost objective. The repercussions of unrestrained climate change can be cataclysmic, including mass extinctions, severe weather events, and unprecedented human displacements. If we concentrate exclusively on adaptation without tackling the underlying causes of climate change—such as lowering greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to renewable energy—we risk worsening the situation. Preventive measures through sustainable practices and policies can lessen the impacts of climate change, making adaptation more feasible and economically viable over time.In summary, while adapting to climate change is critical and demands urgent action, it should not overshadow our prevention initiatives. A balanced strategy that emphasizes both prevention and adaptation is essential. By decreasing our carbon emissions and embracing sustainable development models, we can alleviate the effects of climate change and foster resilient communities capable of thriving in a shifting environment. Ultimately, adapting to climate change should not be viewed as a substitute for prevention but rather as a complementary tactic to create a sustainable future for everyone.
1341;Some people think that it is fine for professional athletes to misbehave on or off the field, as long as they are playing well (opinion);"Some people think that it is fine for professional sportsmen and sportswomen to misbehave on or off the field, as long as they are playing well.Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Sample EssayAlthough most professional athletes are aware of their position as role models for their fans and behave accordingly, there are sportsmen and sportswomen who behave poorly during matches and in their private life. While some people find it acceptable as long as their performance on the field is not impacted, not everyone agrees with that point of view.Those who put athletes’ performance on the field above everything else point out that competitive environment and immense pressure the sports people are under affect their behavior. They argue that athletes are entitled to privacy and their actions before and after games should not concern the general public. I find this hard to agree with, because poor behavior in sports people is incompatible with their role in public’s life and also for the reason that their actions could negatively affect their entire sports industry.The main reason why I believe athletes should behave well at all times is that their behavior is tremendously influential. Spectators respect players and many copy their actions and behavior; therefore, if top players misbehave or violate laws, some of the fans may feel compelled to follow their example and behave badly. For example, after an acclaimed baseball player was caught using drugs some years ago, the number of people who were arrested for the same crime significantly increased. This shows quite clearly why high profile players should consider their actions very carefully in order to promote a peaceful society.In addition, the behavior of athletes might affect the popularity of their sports. Some companies sponsor successful athletes who boost their brand recognition and sales of their products. Players and sports industry executives are financially compensated for endorsing products and participating in commercial advertisements. If they demonstrate poor behavior, sponsors could direct their money elsewhere, and as a result sports matches could suffer due to lack of funds. To illustrate, Sumo, a traditional Japanese sport, is held every season thanks to resources donated by companies. In a year when a Sumo player was involved in a violent crime, no matches were held, resulting in a large deficit of funds.In conclusion, I completely disagree with the opinion that top athletes are permitted to behave badly because their behavior may negatively influence the public behavior and sports industry itself.Assessor’s comment: This response addresses both sides of the argument by exploring the reasons why some people think athletes are allowed to behave poorly as long as they play well, and the reasons why others think poor behavior has no excuse. This response deserves a high score for task achievement because of that. A good range of cohesive devices is used in this essay; that and the organisation of ideas makes it easy to follow. Sentence structures are varied and the vocabulary is quite rich, the author also showed good control of grammar and spelling. It is worth noting that this sample is longer than the recommended 260 – 285 words, however, this isn’t an issue provided the author can complete an essay of this length and quality in under 40 minutes. Overall this is a good example of a Band 8 essay.";The idea that professional athletes can act irresponsibly on and off the field as long as they excel in their sport has ignited significant debate. While some hold this view, believing that an athlete's main obligation is to achieve results, others argue that this perspective is flawed and problematic. I align more with the latter viewpoint.Professional athletes serve as role models and ambassadors for their sports, brands, and often their nations. Their behavior is closely watched by fans, the media, and young people who look to them for guidance. Allowing inappropriate behavior simply because an athlete is successful sends a harmful message—that winning excuses misconduct. This not only diminishes the principles of fair play and sportsmanship but also fosters a culture in which ethics and morality take a backseat to victory.Additionally, accepting misbehavior can lead to serious consequences for both the athlete and their community. Athletes who engage in wrongful conduct may face legal challenges, damage to their reputation, and the potential loss of sponsorships. Their actions can also set a poor example for younger fans, potentially normalizing undesirable behavior in daily life. We must also consider the negative effects on team dynamics and the overall integrity of sports.It is crucial for professional leagues, teams, and sponsors to enforce high standards of conduct, ensuring that athletes are held accountable for their behavior. By doing so, we foster a culture that values both outstanding performance and integrity of character. Ultimately, the measure of a professional athlete should encompass not only their skills on the field but also their character off it. By raising our expectations for athletes, we preserve the dignity of sports and contribute to a society that values moral and ethical standards.
1422;Some people think that it is important to use leisure time for activities that develop the mind, such as reading and doing crossword puzzles. Others feel that it is important to give one’s mind a rest in leisure time. Discuss.;As we are human we naturally need to rest leisure time to stress of work and everyday life. In fact, every individual need to do what they want and . Personally, I prefer to be active during this time because . Moreover, people are free what they do their leisure time, and nobody can say what is the best.Some people want to relax after their day of work. These people may prefer to relax by watching movies, reading or getting a massage. People who have a such as doctors, teachers and builders may choose these types of activities. If you are a doctor, you may feel that you want to let your body rest after work and you don’t want to do a five kilometer run after work, because you are already physically tired.On the other hand, some people choose to be active in their leisure time because they do . For example, these people many spend all day sitting on a chair and their work. At the end of a working day, they a backache, and all of their body tired so they need to stretch their arms and improve their health by doing some activity such as going to the gym or swimming.To sum up, the important thing is that people want to stay healthy by choosing what is best for them. In my view, the wrong way is to stay at home in your leisure time if you have a job.;The use of leisure time has ignited a discussion among people, with some supporting the idea of engaging in mentally stimulating activities, while others emphasize the importance of relaxation and mental breaks. On one side, participating in activities like reading and solving crossword puzzles can greatly benefit cognitive development and mental sharpness. Such endeavors not only improve memory and problem-solving capabilities but also expand one’s knowledge and awareness of the world. Additionally, they provide enjoyment and a sense of personal fulfillment, contributing to an enriched and productive life.Conversely, some believe that leisure time should be dedicated to giving the mind a chance to rest and recharge. In today’s fast-paced and often stressful environment, it is vital to allow the mind to unwind. Engaging in mentally demanding activities during leisure can result in mental fatigue, diminished motivation, and an increased risk of burnout. Furthermore, taking time for relaxation can lead to various physical and mental health benefits, such as lower stress levels, improved mood, and enhanced overall well-being.In conclusion, finding a balance between mental engagement and relaxation is essential for a healthy and productive lifestyle. While challenging and developing our minds is important, so too is allowing for moments of relaxation and rest. By blending both stimulating activities and serene pursuits in our leisure time, we can foster cognitive growth, alleviate stress, and enhance our overall quality of life. Therefore, the key issue isn’t which approach is better but how we can harmonize the two for a rewarding and fulfilling existence.
1215;Some people think that it is important to use leisure time for activities that improve the mind, such as reading and doing word puzzles.Other people feel that it is important to rest the mind during leisure time.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.Write at least 250 words.;Leisure period from our everyday busy schedules is absolutely a well cherished time by most people. What should exactly be done during this free time has been the subject of debate for a while. Some would argue that engaging in simple and less brain tasking activities during this time keeps the mind busy,facilitates mental alertness and sanity.While other scholars would argue that keeping the mind relaxed would improve focus and recharge the mind for when needed at work after the free period has waned off.On the one hand, it seems beneficial to engage in activities that keeps the mind slightly engaged during our leisure period. This is basically due to the fact that some mind consciousness might be lost when idle.Sluggishness may thereforeset in when required to partake in activities that requires full attention. Hence playing chess and games might help maintain ones' awareness during a less busy period. Secondly, getting involved in basic activities like reading and surfing the internet during these free period could also help improve ones intellectual capacity and also overall general knowledge that could well be very beneficial to improving the entire state of the mind.On the other hand, those who say its essential to rest the mind after extensive period of activities might have a point.This is because resting the mind will help recharge Ones' batteries and general condition of the mind. Take for instance, a Tech inclined engineer that uses his mind and brain a lot to profer solutions to complex problems. A liitle period to be calm and relaxed will be of utmost importance to alleviate a potential mind and thoughts exhaustion.In conclusion, while it seems very important and beneficial to rest the mind during leisure period to aid rebooting of the mind and brain.I strongly believe that getting involved is some innovative and creative activities during these period improves our general state of health and mind.;The discussion surrounding the best ways to spend leisure time has ignited a lively debate among people. Some argue that this time should be utilized for intellectually engaging pursuits like reading and solving puzzles, as these activities can enhance cognitive abilities and foster personal development. This viewpoint is based on the belief that just as physical exercise is vital for a healthy body, mental workouts are necessary for a sharp and agile mind. Participating in activities like reading and puzzles can strengthen memory, enhance problem-solving capabilities, and even help slow down age-related cognitive decline.Conversely, there are those who contend that leisure time ought to be devoted to resting the mind, allowing it to relax and recover from the pressures of everyday life. This perspective highlights the significance of relaxation and downtime in supporting mental health and avoiding burnout. Taking time to rest can alleviate anxiety, uplift mood, and improve overall life satisfaction. For example, stepping away from mentally demanding tasks can provide individuals with the chance to recharge, enabling them to approach their responsibilities with renewed energy and focus.In my view, achieving a balance between mental engagement and relaxation is essential for making the most of leisure time. While participating in intellectually stimulating activities can be advantageous, it is equally important to allow the mind time to unwind and recuperate. Personally, I often dedicate my weekends to reading and acquiring new skills, but I also prioritize moments for relaxation and meditation. This approach helps me maintain a healthy and productive mindset while minimizing the risk of mental fatigue. Ultimately, finding the right balance between cognitive stimulation and rest is vital for overall well-being and maximizing the benefits of leisure time.
865;Some people think that it is more beneficial to take part in sports which are played in teams, like football, while other people think that taking part in individual sports, like tennis or swimming, is better. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Sport play an essential role in shaping the personality of individual. Some people believe that sports which are played in teams are more beneficial like football, while others think that solo sports like tennis or swimming is better. The following essay will discuss both arguments and give my opinion that sports which are played in teams have more advantages over solo sport activites.First of all, there is no doubt that the individual sport activities enahnce people confidence. It helps building the personality and strentghen the mentality of the individuals. For examole, one role model in my home country was playing tennis table, he mentioned once in an interview, that sport helped him not only to win trophies but it raised his mental strength and shaped his pesonality.However, some people believe that, sports which are played in teamshave more advantages and all community will get the benefits. Soccer, for example, will help the players specifically the young children to understand working together and sharing the responsibility. In addition people will grow with better understanding to the concept of sharing achievements which can improve all the community. For instance, i was a member of soccer team in high school, me and my friends were taught, in order to win games we should put plans together and work as one unit. Furthermore, it helps me later in my career to understand the meaning of leadership and how the sharing responsibility and working together could bring the success to our endeavour.To conclude, solo sport can bring proud and honour to individuals butsports which played in teams teach people the meaning of working together which will improve the community in the future.;The ongoing discussion about the advantages of team sports versus individual sports has generated considerable debate. While some argue that team sports, like football, offer greater benefits, others contend that individual sports, such as tennis or swimming, are more advantageous. In this essay, I will explore both viewpoints and share my perspective.On one side, team sports present a variety of benefits, including the enhancement of social skills, collaboration, and a sense of community. Engaging in team sports allows participants to connect with their peers, building a sense of belonging and teamwork. Furthermore, these sports often necessitate strategic thinking and effective communication, which encourages problem-solving abilities and adaptability. For example, in football, players must unite to reach a shared objective, which strengthens their ability to collaborate and depend on one another.Conversely, individual sports provide distinct advantages, including enhanced mental resilience, self-discipline, and effective time management. Competing in individual sports, such as tennis or swimming, allows athletes to concentrate on their own performance, empowering them to establish personal goals and monitor their progress. These sports foster self-motivation and personal accountability, as athletes bear full responsibility for their achievements and challenges. A tennis player, for instance, must cultivate the mental fortitude to navigate obstacles and maintain focus during matches.In my view, both team and individual sports offer unique benefits, and the decision between them ultimately hinges on individual preferences and aspirations. Nevertheless, I believe team sports provide a more comprehensive experience, as they blend physical activity with social engagement and collaboration. Ultimately, participating in any sport—whether team-based or individual—is advantageous for both physical and mental well-being. Individuals should select the sport that aligns best with their interests, enabling them to enjoy the many benefits of participation, whether they value the camaraderie of team sports or the autonomy of individual endeavors.
765;Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children’s development than playing computer games. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Some individuals believe that playing outside has a more positive effect on children's development rather than playing computer games. I share the idea that being involved in outdoor activities is more beneficial than playing computer games.Active development is the main reason for including outdoor activities in children's life. All people know that the development of children is an extremely significant part of building a personality. To do so parents should try to involve their children in exploring local insects, animals or playing different games such as football, riding bicycles, and many other. This will only expand the knowledge of children, and consequently have a positive effect on their development. This is also important to have a healthy generation in the future. Parents can join their children or they can find some friends around and also be socially active. For example, a father can teach his son how to bicycle or how to take care of plants and trees.The next important reason for doing more outdoor activities for children is avoiding physical problems, which can cause computer games. Currently, a lot of people including children suffer from different side effects of a lazy lifestyle and obesity can exemplify it. To avoid problems with physical health in the future, spending a couple of hours should be recommended to all children.Of course, little time spent playing computer games will not hurt children, but it is important to limit it. To sum up, children should do more outdoor activities and play computer games less.;The ongoing debate regarding the relative advantages of outdoor activities compared to computer games for children's development has ignited vigorous discussions. While some advocate for the merits of video games, I firmly believe that outdoor activities offer greater benefits for the comprehensive development of children.Engaging in outdoor activities, such as sports, playing in parks, or exploring nature, provides a multitude of essential benefits for a child's physical, mental, and social growth. Physically, these activities enhance motor skills, balance, and coordination, while also encouraging a healthy lifestyle through calorie burning and fitness maintenance. Additionally, spending time outdoors allows children to absorb sunlight, which is vital for producing vitamin D, crucial for strong bones.Beyond physical advantages, outdoor pursuits significantly contribute to mental and social development. Nature has been shown to lower stress levels and elevate mood, fostering improved mental health. Socially, outdoor activities often require interaction with peers, imparting important lessons in teamwork, communication, and friendship. These social competencies are essential for forming lasting relationships and succeeding in future professional endeavors.Conversely, while computer games can develop problem-solving abilities, strategic thinking, and quick reflexes, they often fall short of providing the holistic benefits that outdoor activities deliver. Prolonged gaming can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, increasing the risk of obesity and various health concerns. Moreover, social interactions within online gaming communities can occasionally be detrimental, exposing children to cyberbullying or unsuitable content.In summary, although computer games offer certain advantages, the extensive benefits of outdoor activities for children's physical, mental, and social development are undeniable. It is crucial for parents and educators to prioritize encouraging children to engage in outdoor activities, ensuring they grow into balanced, healthy individuals equipped with the skills necessary to thrive in every aspect of life.
613;Some people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;It is often argued out there about sports, debating about both physcial and mental strengths and which is far more crucial to the success. This essay will go over these two points of view in further depth and outline some expamples, where relevant, for each.On one side, some people think that the most important factor to succeeding in sports is the physical strength. Body strength is actually quite indispensable in any sport activity, especially those types of sports that demand a high fitness level and high physical endurance, etc, such as MMA fights, wrestling, football, and so on. All of these require an elevated and advanced charachterestics of one's body. For example, an athlete can not keep up a football match and running around for 90 minutes without a high body endurance, fitness, so on and so forth.On the other hand, the others believe that a powerful mentality and mindset are needed for such success and accomplishment. That is, they believe that one's attitude is the first key to success before anything else. People need to have some sort of a mindset with specific qualities, such as perseverance, determination, concentration, etc. and it's not always about havign a massive body strength. For example, some MMA athletes step in the ring with solid bodies, will not always win the games if they're not determined and persistent already, altought their opponents do not have that huge bodies. It's all about the mindset.In conclusion, it's not easy to decide which of these two criteria is more important than the other. However, I believe that any athlete must have these two, train them both before getting into any challenge, no matter what type of activity. An athlete must have a strong body and a trained attitude once and for all.;The discussion about the role of physical versus mental strength in achieving success in sports has been a longstanding one. While some contend that physical strength is the primary factor for success, others argue that mental fortitude is even more vital. This essay will explore both perspectives and present a viewpoint on the issue.On one side, physical strength is undeniably crucial for success in sports. A robust and fit body allows athletes to perform optimally, handle the physical demands of their sport, and recover from injuries more effectively. For example, sports such as football, rugby, and boxing necessitate significant levels of physical strength and endurance. Athletes with well-developed physical capabilities are more likely to thrive in these environments and gain a competitive advantage.Conversely, mental strength is equally, if not more, critical for success in sports. Mental resilience empowers athletes to navigate challenges, maintain focus under pressure, and uphold a positive attitude despite difficulties. Many high-achieving athletes, like tennis star Novak Djokovic and golfer Tiger Woods, credit their accomplishments to their mental toughness and their ability to remain focused and driven. Mental strength is also essential for effective teamwork, strategic planning, and decision-making—key elements in most sports.In my view, mental strength outweighs physical strength when it comes to achieving success in sports. While physical abilities lay the groundwork for athletic performance, it is mental resilience that distinguishes champion athletes from the rest. Mental strength allows athletes to surpass their physical limits, conquer fear and anxiety, and sustain high performance levels even in challenging situations. In summary, although both physical and mental strengths are vital for success in sports, it is the mental fortitude that provides the distinction between good athletes and great ones.
1349;Some people think that public health in a country can be improved by government making laws regarding nutritious food (agree/disagree).;Some people think that public health within a country can be improved by government making laws regarding nutritious food. Others, however, think that health is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Personal and public health are tightly related to food choices. While some people believe that the government should regulate nutrition to improve public wellness, others argue that it should be people’s decision whether to pursue a healthy diet or not. This essay will discuss both points of view and explain why the authorities should not control the types of food people can buy.Legislators could impose laws concerning nutritious food in an effort to have a healthier population, public health costs. Even if this could be considered a good idea, it would be very quite difficult to implement. To achieve this target, the rulers could impose a levy on unhealthy food options, or reduce their availability on the grocery stores shelves. In Italy, for example, products such as carbonated sugary drinks and chips are heavily taxed. As a result, the sales of these items have decreased. However, if the authorities start to take control of what their citizens can or cannot eat, it may be seen as limitation of freedom.Since personal freedom is an extremely important human right, many people think that they should be responsible for their choices regarding the food and drinks they decide to consume. I agree with this opinion because limiting nutritional options, even if it is done with the best outcome in mind, could consequently create dissatisfaction among the population, which would possibly lead to other public issues such as protests and demonstrations. A better approach could be educating the public about a healthy diet, which would help people make better-informed decisions about the food they consume. Many developed countries around the world employed this strategy and saw public health gains.In conclusion, even though the government is able to control the dietary habits of its population through taxation and restrictions, healthier citizens and reduced public health expenses isn’t the only possible outcome. Limiting personal freedom could result in social unrest and for that reason diet decisions are better to be left up to well-informed individuals.This response achieved the task requirements by discussing whether the government or individuals should be in control of their diet. The ideas are developed and supported by examples, the information is organised in paragraphs, and coherence is maintained throughout the essay. A range of sentences structures and advanced vocabulary is used in this work. Overall, it seems worthy of IELTS Band 8+.;The debate surrounding whether government regulations on nutritious food can enhance public health is a contentious one. I believe that such regulations can indeed have a beneficial effect on public health.One key reason for this is that government policies can help limit the production and sale of unhealthy food options. For example, laws can be introduced to cap the amount of sugar and salt that can be included in food products or to restrict the sale of items high in saturated fats. This encourages food manufacturers to create healthier alternatives, thereby increasing the availability of nutritious options for the public.Additionally, government regulations can foster education and awareness regarding healthy eating. Laws can be implemented to enhance the transparency of food labeling, empowering consumers to make informed dietary choices. Moreover, educational campaigns can be initiated to raise awareness about the significance of a balanced diet and the potential dangers of consuming unhealthy foods.However, some critics may argue that these laws could be too restrictive and may infringe on personal freedoms. Nonetheless, the advantages of improving public health outweigh any potential downsides. A healthier population can lead to lower healthcare costs, heightened productivity, and improved quality of life. In summary, regulations concerning nutritious food can serve as an effective method for governments to enhance public health within their nations. By promoting healthy eating habits and improving access to nutritious food, governments can make significant strides toward building a healthier and more sustainable society.
1386;Some people think that students who don’t take a break in studies between the high school and the university are at disadvantage compared to students who travel and work after high school before further continuing their education. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, in our competitive world, to succeed, knowledge from school and university is not enough. Therefore, students who study from the school to university get fewer benefits and contribute less too, compared to those who travel or work and get experience and skills . There are two following reasons to support for my opinion. I refer to the group of people who study from school to university as ‘group A’ and the other group – as ‘group B’.Firstly, at school and university, what group A gains is almost entirely theory, theory and theory. Of course, theory is very , however, you can’t do everything with just theory. You must have experience. This is what group A . Although in the third or fourth year at university, group A can be apprentices in some companies, to help them approach their future jobs, they aren’t trained well because of the short time spent working. And the real job is still very strange to them. After graduating, without experience, group A students can’t accomplish their work perfectly. On the other hand, it takes them time and money to keep up with other experienced students and they may be scorned. Therefore, group A students can contribute less than group B who have the two most important things: skills and experience.Secondly, as group A students are contributing less, they surely get less benefit. Moreover, many companies which employ people in group A have to train them from ground-up. These companies take this cost from group A’s salary to reduce the risk of their employees leaving to other companies after being trained. So, less benefits are unavoidable and certain, group B members are more loyal and effective workers. They also have useful experience and skills. Besides, their education is the same as or even higher than that of group A. As the result, group B gets more benefits absolutely.In conclusion, I think a student should travel or work before going to the university. That way, not only will they have basic knowledge but also skills and experience which are useful for them to get a good job and have a brilliant future.;The choice to take a break between high school and university has ignited a lively discussion among students and educators. While some argue that immediately transitioning to university studies is the most effective path, others contend that a gap year spent traveling and working can offer significant benefits. Personally, I believe that students who skip this break may find themselves at a disadvantage compared to their peers who take the time off.A gap year provides students with the opportunity to acquire valuable life experiences, cultivate new skills, and expand their horizons. Engaging in travel and work allows them to explore their interests, boost their confidence, and learn to become independent. This hiatus from academic pressures also enables students to recharge and refocus, often resulting in enhanced motivation and improved academic performance when they do enter university. Additionally, those who take a gap year frequently develop essential soft skills, such as time management, teamwork, and problem-solving, which are highly sought after by employers.Conversely, students who move directly from high school to university may face burnout and struggle with academic pressures. They might miss out on the maturity and self-awareness that come from a break, potentially leading to poor decision-making and a higher likelihood of dropping out. The intense demands of academia can also stifle their creativity and limit personal growth.In summary, I strongly advocate for taking a break between high school and university. It presents students with a unique chance to pursue their interests, acquire vital life skills, and gain a competitive advantage in the job market. While it may seem counterproductive, a gap year can ultimately pave the way for greater academic achievement and personal satisfaction.
1281;Some people think that the most important thing about being rich is it gives a person the opportunity to help other people.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Helping other people in society is noble goal ,to some people it's a big achievement .However rebuilding personality of individuals and giving them an opportunity to leave an influence in the community is reflecting the genuien humanity .Therefore i agree with notion that rich people who are, in fact have the ability to offer the help for orthers in order to recreate healthy environment for everbody to work in our society .The following essay will illuminate the reason behind my opinion .Regrettably . many people suffer form disadvantages situtaions nowdays like losing jobs or money ,they find themselves have no energy or motive to contiune and to help their families . As a result of that poverty propagates in some society and usually accompany with low level availability of education . Hence to avoid falling into misery, some countries nowdays help non governmenrtal organizations and institutions to give assist to poor communities in a manner to raise education and develop health sector. For instance , Red Cross and Save the children , both organizations offere help and leverage human rebuild personality which no doubt will enrich these communities with several benefits .In spite of green vevet picture that mentioned above , some people think that helping people alone is not enough . However , others believe that no matter how grim or daunting things may seem , if the individual have the courage to move a head , then everything is possible . Nevertheless people can find the motive inside eventhoughlife handed them a toughest time . For example Helen Keller .An American Author , although she born with disability but she could be one of greatest authors in western history .In summary , no doubt that people should have the courage to move a head whether they find help from others or not . However people who can offer the help will make our community live peacefully and bring prosperity to our offsprings .;The belief that wealth is primarily valuable because it allows individuals to assist others resonates with many people, and I share this view. Indeed, financial resources can be a powerful means of positively influencing the lives of others.One of the main ways in which wealth can facilitate helping others is through philanthropy. Affluent individuals possess the financial means to contribute to charitable initiatives, support educational organizations, and fund medical research. Take, for example, billionaires like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, who have committed substantial portions of their fortunes to philanthropic endeavors aimed at eradicating diseases, enhancing education, and reducing poverty. Their contributions highlight how wealth can serve as a formidable force for good.Additionally, wealth enables the creation of jobs and the stimulation of economic growth in disadvantaged communities. By investing in businesses and startups, wealthy individuals can create employment opportunities that empower people to elevate their socio-economic standing. This can initiate a ripple effect of prosperity and stability in the communities that are most in need.However, it is also crucial to recognize that the impulse to help others is not limited to those with wealth. Individuals from diverse backgrounds contribute meaningfully to their communities, often through volunteerism, community service, or simply by being supportive friends and neighbors. Nevertheless, the scale and impact of aid provided by those with significant financial means are uniquely influential.In summary, the ability to help others is an essential aspect of being wealthy. Through philanthropy, job creation, and economic development, wealth can act as a vital catalyst for positive change in the world. While the desire to assist is not exclusive to the affluent, the capacity to create meaningful large-scale differences is undeniably amplified by financial resources.
1081;Some people think that there should be strict laws to control the amount of noise a person makes because of the disturbance it causes to people.Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;With the increasing population in cities,noise pollution has been one of the important causes of concern.This essay presents the advantages and disadvantages of the strict laws that are made to control noise pollution.Noise pollution affects different groups of people in various ways.The increasing noise in recent days has led to increasing problems of hearing impairment in people in today's society.Also,the noise pollution has a devastating affects on the heart patients and it has been affecting people who are working and studying in various ways.By implementing strict rules like imposing heavy fines on vehicles honking unnecessarily and filing a case on the noise caused by the public gatherings like rallies,the above problems can be addressed.For example, recent studies have shown that the cities having less noise pollution have been leading better life when compared to those with noise pollution.However,implementing strict laws on noise caused by a person also has some disadvantages.Firstly,different religions have different kinds of festivals which cause a lot of noise.For instance,diwali,one of the most celebrated festivals in India,is celebrated by firing crackers causing a lot of noise is affected by implementing these laws.Secondly,most of the people with religious beliefs will have a bad impact by these rules.To give an example,the prayers in masjids are made with loud noise so that it can reach a large group of people living in the area.To conclude,implemeting strict rules like fines and filing a case on the people causing noise pollution have a good impact on the health of the society and increasing the efficiency of work where as the festivals and the religious centres have a negative impact by these laws.;"The proposal for implementing stringent regulations to manage noise levels has ignited a spirited discussion. Advocates of this approach contend that excessive noise can greatly disrupt the peace, especially in residential neighborhoods. On one hand, strict noise regulations may offer multiple benefits. They can help foster a tranquil atmosphere, which is vital for individuals' mental and physical health. Additionally, such laws can shield residents from noise pollution resulting from loud music, construction, or traffic—factors that can contribute to health issues like hearing impairment and heightened stress.Conversely, there are notable drawbacks to consider. Highly restrictive noise regulations may encroach upon personal freedoms and creativity. For instance, musicians or music institutions might be compelled to curtail their practice time or cancel outdoor performances, thereby hindering artistic expression. Furthermore, enforcing strict noise laws can prove challenging, since the definition of ""excessive noise"" is often subjective and can vary widely among individuals. This may result in unnecessary disputes between neighbors or with law enforcement.In my view, a balanced strategy is essential. While maintaining a peaceful environment is important, it is equally necessary to allow for a reasonable degree of creative expression and freedom. For example, implementing designated quiet hours or establishing noise-free zones could serve as more effective and pragmatic solutions. Ultimately, achieving a compromise that respects the needs and rights of all community members is crucial in addressing noise disturbances. By doing so, we can cultivate a more harmonious and respectful community atmosphere."
1431;Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than with a teacher. Others think that it is always better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.;It is certainly said that learning is an ongoing process .Every person something new their age, experience, knowledge and education. According to my point of view it is always better to have teacher or guide for study.One teacher has adequate knowledge to teach their student. knows ways to make subject easier for the students, moreover, he teaches them in an effective manner. For example, some students are weak in some subjects but a teacher them according to their mental capacity. . Some people can learn better in the topics with others. In class people can the views of others, . .In the today’s competitive world, everybody is busy, some people think that their time classes they can learn better their subject . They can attend online classes by using the Internet at home. They can get relevant information from the Internet regarding their topic. There is specific time or age limit to learn something new. Some new things we can only learn from experience – for example new facts, new habits and so on., I would like to say that it is always better for the people to have a teacher because a teacher has good knowledge, experience and is educated how to teach others. People will learn from a teacher in an easier way rather than on their own.;The ongoing debate regarding the effectiveness of learning with or without an instructor has generated considerable discussion. Some argue that self-directed learning is the most effective method for acquiring knowledge, while others contend that having a teacher is vital for optimal education. Personally, I advocate for learning with a teacher, and I believe there are compelling reasons for this preference.Firstly, a teacher offers personalized support and feedback, which is essential for identifying and correcting errors and enhancing comprehension. When studying independently, it can be challenging to spot and amend mistakes, potentially leading to the establishment of harmful habits and misunderstandings. In contrast, a teacher can provide timely interventions, helping students remain aligned with their learning goals. Moreover, teachers can customize their teaching approaches to accommodate the diverse needs and learning styles of their students, resulting in a more effective educational experience.Another notable benefit of learning with a teacher is the chance for interactive and stimulating instruction. Teachers can foster a vibrant learning atmosphere through discussions, debates, and hands-on activities, making complex ideas more approachable and enjoyable. This social dimension of education also promotes critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and communication skills, all of which are crucial for success in both academic and professional settings.On the other hand, self-study can often be a lonely and isolating endeavor, lacking the motivational and emotional encouragement that a teacher can provide. In the absence of a teacher, students may find it harder to remain motivated and focused, possibly leading to procrastination and reduced productivity. Furthermore, teachers can offer valuable guidance for continued learning, encouraging students to explore new interests and deepen their understanding of various subjects.In summary, while self-study does present certain benefits, I firmly maintain that learning with a teacher is the more effective approach. The individualized guidance, engaging instruction, and emotional support provided by a teacher contribute to a more enriching, efficient, and enjoyable learning experience. Ultimately, the advantages of having a teacher significantly surpass those of self-study, making it the ideal option for optimal education.
693;Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Space, so unknown for the humankind that it generates so much curiosity among experts and enterprenues. Due to this curiosity, the amount of resources and money invested in its exploration is surprisingly big. Developing technology for it is expensive but, in my humble opinion, completly justified.Firstly, developing technology is vital so that space exploration can be carried out succesfully. Experts have discovered that we only know a 4 percent of the entire universe. If with only that 4 percent we have accomplished amazing achievements, imagine what the human race could do when knowing a 10 percent.Secondly, space exploration and the technology involve on it not only will help the human race understand the universe but also will provide a whole new kind of tourism, space tourism. The CEOs of some of the most profitable business in America are investigating this possibility. The leading enterprises in this sector are Blue Origin from Jeff Bezos and Space X from Elon Musk. When discovered the way of sending people to space safely, space tourism will generate twice the money spent on technology for space exploration.In a nutshell, space exploration is crutial for the development of the human race. Furthermore, if this was not enough, all the technology developed will serve the purpose of creating a whole new kind of tourism that will generate billions of dollars in revenue. From my point of view, even though here on earth there are several problems to be solve with money, our future lies on space, so be must spend as much money as possible.;The funding for space exploration has been a contentious issue for many years. While some contend that the financial investment in space technology is unwarranted, I only partly concur with this viewpoint. It is undeniable that there are urgent challenges on Earth, such as poverty, hunger, and disease, that demand substantial financial resources. Allocating funds toward alleviating these issues could yield immediate and meaningful benefits for many lives.Conversely, I contend that the advantages of space exploration significantly outweigh its costs. Research in this field has spurred countless innovations and breakthroughs that enhance our everyday experiences, including developments in GPS technology, telecommunications, and medical science. Additionally, exploring space could unveil new resources, such as minerals and energy, which could greatly influence the global economy. Moreover, space exploration enables us to deepen our understanding of the universe and our position within it, potentially leading to important scientific revelations.Technological advancements derived from space exploration can also address pressing Earthly challenges, including climate change and sustainable development. For instance, satellite technology plays a crucial role in monitoring climate trends and responding to natural disasters, while space-based solar power offers a clean and sustainable energy alternative. In closing, although I recognize the existence of urgent issues on our planet that need financial attention, I maintain that the merits of space exploration justify the investment. By continuing to fund space research, we can unlock new technologies, resources, and scientific insights that will profoundly benefit humanity and our planet.
1309;Some people today believe that it is acceptable to use physical force to discipline children, but others feel it is completely unacceptable.Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Punishing children with physical force, or corporal punishment as it is also called, is something that was accepted not so long ago and people over the age of forty may well remember it. Nowadays, however, corporal punishment is against the law in most countries and adults who practise it can be taken to court. Children are always a vulnerable group and they depend on adults for protection and education. Of course, part of the growing up process is testing and breaking boundaries and it is nearly always necessary to instill discipline on a child. Whether or not it is necessary to use physical force to do so can be a very emotive subject.Supporters of corporal punishment often defend their standpoint by explaining that the corporal punishment is not, or should not be, excessive. They do not argue that a child should be beaten severely until he or she is bruised or cut. They argue that just the infliction of mild pain causes effective discipline and also the fear that it might be applied. People who grew up experiencing it might offer this point of view.Those who oppose using physical force on a child would say that the vulnerability and innocence of a child means that force should never be used. Children need to trust adults and believe that no harm will come to them. Additionally, children learn from adults and it is argued that corporal punishment will only teach children that force is an answer to various problems. It is also claimed that corporal punishment has no added benefits over other forms of discipline that do not require physical force. Using it can cause psychological harm to children and should be classed as child abuse.Personally, I do not believe that limited use of forms of corporal punishment can cause harm, and a parent who administers a mild form of it to his or her child should not be subject to criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, I would not use it myself. I can also recognise the possibilities of adults who are not a child’s parents misusing corporal punishment. Therefore, I believe that on balance physical force to discipline children should not be permitted.;The topic of using physical force to discipline children is a contentious issue, with opinions varying widely. Some argue that it is a permissible form of punishment, while others vehemently oppose it. Personally, I believe that employing physical force as a disciplinary method is entirely unacceptable, and I will explain my reasons for this perspective.To begin with, physical punishment can cause both physical and emotional damage to children. Research indicates that children who endure physical discipline are at a higher risk of developing anxiety, depression, and aggressive behaviors. For example, a child who is frequently spanked may come to fear their parent, straining their relationship and eroding trust. Additionally, such methods can instigate a cycle of violence, where children might grow into adults who resort to physical force to handle conflicts.Moreover, physical discipline is ineffective in promoting long-term behavioral change. While it may temporarily curb a child's misbehavior, it fails to teach them the reasons behind their actions or guide them toward better decision-making in the future. On the other hand, approaches rooted in positive reinforcement and clear explanations of rules can foster self-regulation and encourage sound judgment.Finally, there are more effective and non-violent alternatives to physical punishment. Strategies like time-outs, privilege removal, and positive reinforcement provide ways to impart lessons about boundaries and consequences without inflicting harm. In various countries, including Sweden, corporal punishment is illegal, and parents are encouraged to adopt alternative disciplinary methods, contributing to a decline in child abuse rates.In summary, despite the belief of some individuals that physical force is an acceptable form of discipline, I firmly disagree. The potential for physical and emotional harm, its ineffectiveness over time, and the availability of alternative methods of discipline all support the need to reject physical punishment. As a society, we must prioritize children's well-being and safety, advocating for positive and non-violent approaches to discipline.
1358;Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems, is this a positive or negative development?;Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems. Is it a positive or negative development? Give your own opinion and examples from your experience.At present, the Internet plays a vital role in almost every aspect of human life. As a result, individuals are searching online reasonable solutions to their illnesses. Not everyone is convinced that access to such information online is safe and helpful. However, in my view, providing the general public with access to trustworthy information about medical disorders would invariably improve the quality of the medical care for the whole society.Nowadays, even though there are plenty of online platforms developed for medical education, most of the sites have not been written by professional healthcare providers. Hence, there is a high possibility of spreading wrong medical information throughout the world, unless the site developers are held accountable for the content they provide. If patients receive incorrect information about a medical procedure and follow the wrong advice, for instance, to remove a wart at home, it might lead to a serious infection, excessive bleeding or another medical emergency. That would constitute a negative effect of using online knowledge for medical treatments at home rather than visiting a professional.On the flip side, the Internet, the society is well aware of most common medical disorders and preventive measures. Consequently, a reasonable and prudent individual can decide whether to get professional opinion on one’s disease or to handle it at home, that they get reliable online medical information. Moreover, if patients can manage mild medical problems themselves, it would certainly reduce the workload at the local hospitals, freeing more doctors for patients in real need. Besides, if patients come with a certain extent of knowledge about their condition to the medical consultation, it would invariably be helpful to the medical practitioner for effective decision making.To sum up, it is evident that online search for information on medical disorders can be a positive development as long as the general public receives trustworthy information.This response addresses the topic well. The writer’s position is clearly explained and supported, the information is organised in paragraphs in an easy to follow way, and use of linking words is appropriate. A range of complex sentence forms is used and there are very few errors in word choice or word formation (underlined in blue). Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.;The emergence of the Internet has transformed the way people access information, particularly in the medical field. Nowadays, many individuals turn to online resources to find answers to their health concerns, a trend that carries both advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, the Internet offers unprecedented access to a wealth of medical knowledge, empowering patients to take a more active role in their healthcare decisions. This access helps them make informed choices about treatment options and enhances their understanding of their medical conditions. Moreover, digital platforms can improve communication between patients and healthcare providers, thereby elevating the quality of care received.Conversely, there are notable disadvantages to depending on the Internet for medical insights. A major issue is the reliability and accuracy of the information available online. The web is rife with misinformation, making it difficult for individuals without medical training to distinguish credible sources from fraudulent ones. This situation can lead to misdiagnoses or misguided attempts at self-treatment, potentially worsening health problems. Additionally, while online resources can provide helpful information, they cannot replace the thorough, personalized care that healthcare professionals offer, which includes evaluating a patient's complete medical history, conducting physical exams, and interpreting diagnostic tests.In summary, while the Internet serves as a useful tool for researching health-related topics, relying on it as the primary resource for medical guidance poses both benefits and risks. It fosters empowerment and access to vital information but also raises concerns about misinformation and improper self-management of health conditions. Therefore, it is important for individuals to approach online medical information carefully, seeking validation from healthcare professionals to ensure their health decisions are safe and informed. By doing so, they can optimize the advantages of Internet-based medical research while reducing its potential downsides.
949;Some say that because many people are living much longer, the age at which people retire from work should be raised considerably.To what extent do you agree or disagree?;People nowadays are living much longer.With the discovering of new medicine and with the innovation in the medical field, the life expectancy of a person skyrocketed over the last decade.Some people might think that the consequence of this phenomenon should be the fact that the age at which people retire from work ought to be raised considerably.I don't agree with this idea.Rather than involving the life expectancy of a person, we should consider the job itself.Is it tiring? Does it require a person to be able to react immediately to a potential problem?If the job is tiring I think that it would be better for a person to retire. If you end up being worn out every day because your job is very exhausting the life expectancy should not be the fact that decides if you have or not the right to retire.The question ought to be: Is the person physically and mentally able to cope with the work?The older you get the slower you become. This is another pivotal factor that should be taken into account when deciding the retirement age of a person.The ability to react to dangerous events keeps the working environment under control.Let's imagine a carpenter working on the construction of a new building.What if a wall suddenly falls? Does an elderly person react faster than a younger worker?I am an optimistic person but I would stick to my guns in this scenario betting on the younger person.I would like to wrap up this essay by saying that I could have thought of many more reasons that explain why the age at which people retire from work should not be based entirely on the fact that people are living longer.Of course, this can not be ignored but basing this decision only on this fact it is seen by me as a poor approach.;The proposal to significantly raise the retirement age in response to the growing human lifespan has ignited a passionate debate. Proponents argue that such a change is essential for the viability of pension systems, while opponents contend that it would be unjust to require people to work longer. I believe that while there is merit in raising the retirement age, it should be approached with specific considerations in mind.On one hand, increasing the retirement age could relieve some of the strain on pension systems and social security funds. As life expectancy rises, individuals need financial support for a longer period, which can burden the economy. By extending the retirement age, the duration for which individuals receive pension benefits could decrease, helping to ease this financial load. Additionally, older workers can bring valuable experience and skills to the workforce, benefiting both businesses and the overall economy.Conversely, I do not support a substantial increase in the retirement age for everyone. Certain jobs, particularly those involving physical labor or high-stress environments, may not be suitable for older employees. Furthermore, some individuals may face health challenges or caregiving duties that limit their ability to work beyond a certain age. Therefore, a uniform increase in the retirement age may not be fair or practical for every individual.In summary, while I agree that the retirement age may need to be revisited in light of longer lifespans, this adjustment should be tailored to individual circumstances and job requirements. A more flexible retirement framework, allowing people to decide when to retire based on their health, financial status, and personal aspirations, would be a more just approach.
1389;Some say that the Internet is making the world smaller by bringing people together. To what extent do to you agree that the Internet is making it easier for people to communicate with one another?;"A global village, that is certainly what the world feels like nowadays. With the help of the , you can reach out and get to know people you might never have met in person. Articles can be co-authored, business deals can be finalized, degrees can be earned and at times even medical advice can be given- and all of this is just a click away.Electronic mail, instant messages, web cameras and microphones; all these gadgets and programs make the presence of the other person more real. Who knows; with the help of visual reality you might even get a 3-D image of the speaker! I believe that the Internet is one the best inventions of the last century, you can hardly get to miss anyone and nobody is really out of reach. You can keep in touch with your friends, and be able to do your work from your bedroom in your pajamas!However, the internet can also be a major source of harassment. Spammers and hackers can invade your privacy and get personal/confidential information, which otherwise they never get access to. You are never out of anybody’s reach, unless you make a conscious decision of not checking your email, there can be always more work waiting for you in your inbox and you might never have a moment to yourself. Worse yet, if you were a workaholic, you might never experience that stress-free vacation ever again in your life – simply, because you have your mobile workplace with you at all times.As a romantic, I will always look forward to getting an occasional letter in the snail mail. A personal letter, where I can sense the mood of the writer by the slants in his/her handwriting and get to know him/her better. But as a type A personality person, the internet gives me all what I dream of in terms of communication – the speed, reliability, and convenience of time and place. I can certainly tolerate its shortcomings any day, as long as it keeps me close to my loved ones.";The emergence of the Internet has fundamentally transformed how individuals connect with one another. I firmly believe that the Internet has simplified communication, effectively shrinking the world. It has bridged vast geographical distances, allowing people from various backgrounds and locations to engage and interact effortlessly.The explosion of social media platforms and video conferencing tools has empowered individuals to communicate with others around the globe in real-time. This has opened doors to international connections, nurturing friendships, collaborations, and business interactions that cross national boundaries. Additionally, the Internet facilitates the sharing of ideas, cultures, and experiences, enhancing cross-cultural understanding and exchange.Moreover, the Internet has made communication more convenient and accessible than ever. With just a few clicks, people can send emails, messages, or make voice and video calls, removing the need for conventional mail or phone calls. This convenience has been particularly advantageous for those with mobility challenges or those residing in remote areas, enabling them to connect without the need for physical travel.That said, it is essential to recognize that the Internet can sometimes foster a false sense of connection, with individuals replacing face-to-face interactions with online communication. However, the advantages of the Internet in promoting global communication far outweigh its disadvantages. In conclusion, the Internet has undoubtedly simplified communication among people, bringing the world closer together. As the Internet continues to evolve, its capacity to enhance global connections and dialogue will likely expand even further. Ultimately, the Internet has fundamentally altered the way we interact, and its role in making the world smaller is indisputable.
655;Some systems require students to specialize in a limited range of subjects from the age of fifteen. Other systems require students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?;"Education programs are different from one area to another area, there are systems that learners are required to choose restricted number of courses for their academic curriculum by the age of 15.while,other educational systems ask students to take comprehensive courses until they graduate from school. There are many positives for both trends, in my opinion limited range of academic subjects education system is better.On the one hand, it is basic knowledge to accept the idea that pupils who study selected number of subjects from age of fifteen are more informative academically in specified field of study. For example, when student decide to take medical subjects from early age the student will be prepared by tutors completely for the nominated curriculum,as a result all the student's focus will be on medical topics thus, the student is more qualified to practice medicine more efficiently after school graduation.Furthermore, this system will build a solid knowledge background in limited range of subjects can help to develop creativity at early age.Moreover, in the financial view point it may be better for students to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15; selected number of academic subjects means less money allocated for educational services by guardians.On the other hand, it is true to claim that general subjects system can prepare students to be more informative in various different live aspects. Since, students who register with wide range subjects system can gain academic knowledge and support in fields such as mathematics,physics,medicine,and....ect. Therefore,those students can select more than one speciality to practice as a professionalism in future.Besides, wide range system help to improve social interactions better,because friends will not be separated and they continue school education together until graduation,inaddition there is chance to make more friends as primises are more crowded.To sum up, educational systems main target is to develop and progress academic background of students.But, in my opinion,it is better to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15 due to reasons like: solid academic background in specific field,creativity,and less financial burden on parents.";The discussion surrounding the optimal education system has generated considerable debate among educators and policymakers. There are two primary approaches: one that encourages students to concentrate on a narrow range of subjects from a young age, generally starting at fifteen, and another that requires a more extensive curriculum until graduation. Each of these systems has its advantages, and the decision between them ultimately hinges on the educational goals and values in question.The specialization approach enables students to focus intensively on their selected subjects, allowing them to cultivate expertise and build a solid foundation for their future academic or career pursuits. This model is particularly beneficial for those students who possess a clear vision of their career aspirations, as it facilitates skill development in targeted areas. Additionally, it can lead to more efficient use of educational resources, as students are not obliged to engage with subjects that may be irrelevant to their future paths.Conversely, the broad-based system offers students a well-rounded education, exposing them to a diverse array of subjects and promoting a more comprehensive understanding of the world. This method encourages exploration across various disciplines, fosters critical thinking skills, and enhances problem-solving abilities. It also provides students with opportunities to uncover their strengths and interests, which may not be immediately obvious.In conclusion, the ideal educational approach is contingent on the unique needs of individual students and the prevailing values of society. A hybrid model that integrates elements of both specialization and broad-based learning might prove to be the most effective, enabling students to explore different subjects while also allowing for in-depth study in areas of interest. By blending these two systems, educators can offer a well-rounded education that equips students for a dynamic and evolving world.
1347;Some think that children should leave their family home as soon as possible while others believe they should stay for as long as they like (discuss);Some people think that it is best to encourage children to leave their family home as soon as possible. Others believe children should stay at the family home for as long as they like. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayAlthough it is thought by some that urging young people to abandon their family home at an early age is beneficial for them, others believe that it is better if children stay with their families for longer. In my opinion, leaving family home early has many advantages for children.On the one people think that youngsters ought to leave their parents’ house so as to learn life skills at an early age. Their reasoning is that it should push young people towards independence and make them learn from life lessons rather than merely rely on their parents. For example, students who pursue tertiary study away from their home city might learn taking personal responsibility. Also, living independently will teach children a lot by presenting some difficulties, which, consequently, will add some more experience that may prove essential in their future lives.On the other hand, it is argued that children should stay with their parents for longer for several reasons. Firstly, young people need advice from adults, and no one would be better suited to that than their parents. Secondly, life can be generally harsh, for children in particular. In other words, they might or take unnecessary risks if they mix with the wrong crowd. It is commonly known that young people tend to be by unethical people. To avoid that, being under parental supervision is utterly important for children.To sum up, while people’s opinions may vary, I believe that young people should leave their family home at an early age, while parents ought to provide them with appropriate advice and keep an eye on their well-being.This essay covers the task by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of leaving the family home early in life, and the writer’s opinion has been clearly stated. The arguments for and against have been organised in paragraphs and supported by examples. Accuracy of expression needs some work (see suggested corrections underlined in blue) and in one case sentence structure needs more attention. Overall, assuming the errors were corrected, this essay could score Band 8 in IELTS.;The issue of when children should move out of their family home has ignited a lively debate. Some individuals contend that children should leave as soon as possible, while others argue that they should remain at home for as long as they wish. This essay will explore both viewpoints and share my thoughts on the topic.On one side, departing the family home at a young age can bring several advantages for children. It may encourage independence, self-sufficiency, and a sense of responsibility—key qualities for adult life. By living apart from their parents, children can learn essential skills such as budgeting, cooking, and cleaning, ultimately becoming more confident and capable. Furthermore, moving out can allow children to pursue their passions, forge new friendships, and establish their own identities.Conversely, remaining with their family for as long as they choose can provide children with a sense of safety, comfort, and support. Living with their parents can offer emotional stability, financial backing, and guidance, which can be especially crucial during difficult or uncertain times. Additionally, parents can continue to be a significant presence in their children's lives, providing advice, encouragement, and love, assisting them in navigating the complexities of growing up.In my opinion, the decision regarding when to leave the family home should be tailored to individual situations and personal readiness. Some young people may feel prepared to leave home by age 18, while others may benefit from additional time to grow and acquire necessary life skills. Ultimately, open and honest discussions between parents and children about their expectations, needs, and aspirations can lead to a mutual agreement that serves everyone’s best interests. This approach can facilitate a smoother transition to independent adulthood while preserving a strong and loving bond with family.
1333;Some think that young people should be free to choose any career they like, while others say that they should think more realistically about their future. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;"Choosing a future career requires careful consideration. While some people claim that adolescents should be able to pursue a career they would enjoy, others oppose to that, arguing that teenagers should aim for a high-paying job in order to secure a livelihood when they grow up. Given that our life consists of more than just physiological needs, I strongly believe that it is vital to fulfill one’s potential in the career fields that are most compatible with their interests.The youth who choose highly skilled jobs may find it easier to have a fruitful future in a materialistic sense. It is true that some professions, such as engineers or doctors, are well paid and offer more stability compared to work in other, non-professional fields. For example, psychologists usually have higher starting salaries compared to artists; they also rarely lose their jobs in recessions. People who prioritise earning a living might agree that a reliable job is a must for their future and by no means will they take risks to gain employment in a field they are passionate about, that doesn’t pay well.However, it is worth remembering that we are living in a rapidly changing world and the concept of a ‘guaranteed future’ is unrealistic. Even the smartest of us aren’t prophets and it is impossible to foresee many changes in job markets in the future; some high-salaried jobs of today may no longer exist by the time our young people become adults. Therefore, people may choose to pursue their dreams and follow career paths according to their passions and interests now, to avoid having regrets later in life.Having considered the reasons to prefer monetary remuneration over one’s interests, I am convinced that it would be a pity for youths to limit their career choices to highly paid jobs of today. Unforeseen changes in the jobs markets may affect salaries but won’t change the pleasure one derives from doing something they love.";The ongoing debate about career choices for young people has ignited intense discussions. Advocates on one side contend that young individuals should have the freedom to pursue any career they wish, free from external constraints or pressures. This viewpoint underscores the significance of personal passion and interest when selecting a career. Allowing youth to chase their dreams can lead to increased job satisfaction, creativity, and innovation. When individuals engage in work they are passionate about, they are more inclined to excel and make meaningful contributions to their fields.Conversely, there are those who argue that young people ought to adopt a more pragmatic approach to their career choices. This perspective stresses the importance of evaluating factors like job security, salary, and potential for advancement. In today’s highly competitive job market, it’s vital for young individuals to be realistic and strategic in their decisions to ensure financial stability and success. Certain careers may exhibit greater demand than others, and selecting a profession in high demand can enhance job prospects and bring a sense of security.In my view, while considering practical aspects is important, young people should be encouraged to choose careers that resonate with their passions. Passion and enthusiasm are critical drivers of success, and pursuing a beloved career can lead to a more fulfilling and meaningful life. Nevertheless, it's essential for young individuals to remain aware of the practical realities tied to their chosen paths and make informed decisions. Ultimately, finding a balance between personal passion and practical considerations is crucial for enabling young people to make career choices that are both rewarding and sustainable.
1403;Students from rural areas often find it difficult to access university education. Some people think that it should become easier for them to study at universities. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Nowadays, it is acknowledged that students from suburban areas find it tough to receive higher education. Whether it should be made easier for them to access university education becomes an ongoing concern, which incurs a highly-charged debate.Obviously, higher education opportunities bring about benefits to students in multiple ways. For example, higher education becomes increasingly important to senior high school graduates, partly it determines if they have the competitive edge in the job market, and partly because it is seen as a guarantee of a certain level of the mental ability, from the computer literacy that is required by the most employers to the capacities of acquiring new knowledge the soonest possible which is valued by most . With a university degree, students from rural areas obtain a job easily, thereby bettering their living conditions and their family as well.Higher education also, however, to impose a heavy burden on families since the rise in the tuition fees are increasingly beyond those families’ ability to afford. In addition, with the mounting evidence, a university degree is not always a guarantee of seizing a decent job; therefore, their living conditions are likely to able to earn back their tuition fee after graduation. people argue, students from rural areas are not well-advised to pursue a university degree. But I perceive their desire to further their education should not be disrespected and the government should subsidise them to receive higher education.In conclusion, university education should be made fair to everyone, predicated only on their academic performance and mental abilities, rather than their financial capacities and the government should subsidise those students in need.Teacher’s comment: Not all the parts of the task were covered. The writer’s position is relevant to task prompt, the main ideas are also relevant but not all of them are developed well enough. The information is presented coherently, it is evident that the writer progresses from one idea to another.";The challenge of students from rural areas encountering substantial obstacles in accessing university education is a matter of great concern. I firmly believe that efforts should be made to facilitate their pursuit of higher education.To begin with, rural students frequently lack vital resources and infrastructure, making it difficult for them to compete with their urban peers. They often have limited access to quality educational institutions, a scarcity of experienced teachers, and insufficient study materials, all of which impede their success in entrance examinations. Additionally, the financial strain associated with relocating to urban centers for higher education can be daunting for many, leading to significant disparities in enrollment rates between rural and urban students.Conversely, improving access to university education for rural students can yield numerous advantages. It would foster a more diverse and inclusive student population, enriching the academic environment with varied perspectives and experiences. Furthermore, educating students from rural backgrounds can positively influence their communities, as they are likely to return and contribute to local development. This process can help close the gap between urban and rural regions, facilitating more equitable economic growth and social advancement.To address this issue, governments and universities can undertake several initiatives, such as offering scholarships, expanding online course offerings, and forming partnerships with rural schools to improve educational resources. Additionally, universities might consider flexible admission criteria that acknowledge the unique challenges faced by rural students. By implementing these strategies, we can create a fairer opportunity for talented individuals from rural areas to achieve their academic goals and reach their potential. In summary, I strongly advocate for making university education more accessible to rural students, believing that with collective action, we can significantly improve their lives and the communities they represent.
809;The Internet is now used all around the world as a source of information and communication. However, it's often controversial, so many people think it needs to be controlled. Others believe there should be no interference whatsoever.Discuss both points of view, and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The Internet has recently become the most widely spread means of communication and knowledge sharing. It is argued by many if any restrictions should be imposed on it. This essay will discuss both views and explain why the Internet should be free from regulations.One group of people consider that the Internet was developed to overcome a government censure, thus any restrictions will destroy its purpose. Despite the fact that there were independent media, it was practically difficult to share news internally and internationally because of low speed of communication methods such as telegraph or post, which lead to the fact that the most common source of information was government authorities who selected the information they wanted to share. Thus, general citizens’ opinion, views and problems were often unheard. This essay agrees that the ability of sharing information freely between people all over the world makes the government to be transparent as everyone’s opinion and problem may be heard. For example, the problems with extinction of wild animals in Baikal region of Russia due to forest cuts was heard only after a massive attack by the media and local citizens and bloggers that would be impossible without the Internet.The others insist that the Internet allows to people share not only useful knowledge, problems and new, but also violent content. The supporters of the view believe that having an easy access to such content, for example assault, production of bombs, people become prompt to criminal behaviour. Although, the Internet makes the violent information more available, the essay suggests that if an individual want to find violent information, he would do it even in the absence of the Internet. Moreover, recent researches conducted by criminalists uncovered that the increase in the number of criminal offenses is not directly correlated with Internet coverage.In conclusion, although the Internet contains violent content, if needed it may be accessed by interested people from other sources of informations, meanwhile independent flow of information allows individuals to attract attention to their local and even global problems which may be hidden by governments without free Internet.;The internet has become a crucial element of contemporary life, providing unmatched access to information and enabling global communication. Nonetheless, its lack of regulation has ignited a passionate debate regarding the necessity of control versus complete freedom from interference. Supporters of regulation emphasize the risks associated with misinformation, cybercrime, and the exploitation of vulnerable populations, especially children. They argue that a degree of oversight is essential for user protection and societal stability. For example, countries like China have established stringent internet regulations to limit the spread of sensitive information and safeguard national security.Conversely, proponents of an entirely unregulated internet contend that any form of control infringes on freedom of expression and could lead to censorship. They assert that the internet's openness is its greatest asset, fostering the free exchange of ideas and promoting innovation. Unrestricted access to information helps individuals make informed choices and encourages global education and awareness. Notably, during the Arab Spring, the internet was vital in organizing protests and sharing information, underscoring its potential as a catalyst for democracy and social change.In my view, finding a middle ground that reconciles these two viewpoints is the most sensible solution. While some regulation is necessary to shield users from harm, excessive control could hinder the internet’s capacity to drive social progress. It would be prudent to introduce well-defined regulations that specifically address issues like cybercrime and harmful content, while preserving broad access to information. Ultimately, achieving the optimal balance that allows for the internet's many benefits while mitigating its risks requires careful consideration, ensuring that the free flow of information continues while protecting society's most vulnerable members.
1397;The Internet when used as a source of information, has more drawbacks than advantages. To what extent do you agree with this statement?;Some people believe that internet access creates problems. There are several possible reasons why it can happen.Firstly, some data may be unverifiable. For example, they search for a data, there would be lots of choices that would appear on the screen. They would not be sure if the information they are reading is accurate. Some sources may even have outdated . Secondly, some sites may be unreliable. For instance, people sign up on one site that sells goods online. The goods would be paid for by a credit card, but the purchaser would not receive anything. And finally, not everything is available through the net. When my friend had tried to research for some pictures of 18th century paintings, he did not find any results. Then he was told by his teacher that they would only be available in the library.Others believe that the Internet is very useful and these are the justifications. Firstly, it is hard to get the same data, that is available through the Internet by other means. For example, if the directory information could not give me the accurate address and contact number of a place I to visit, I normally check that information on the Internet. In just one click, I would get all the details of that company. Secondly, research becomes more comprehensive. For instance, I do not have to buy lots of reading materials to complete my research. Most of the needed information can be found if I have Internet access. And finally, data is easily compared and contrasted. researched a study about overweight children a decade ago and at presentwas able to finish his research in just one day, as compared to a week if he would not use the Internet.In conclusion, let me reiterate that the Internet plays a big role in our life, because it makes data retrieval and comparison easier.;The rise of the Internet has transformed how we access and share information. Yet, the perspective that the Internet poses more disadvantages than benefits is a matter of ongoing discussion. While there are indeed some downsides to using the Internet for information, I find myself only partially in agreement with this viewpoint.On one side, the Internet offers unprecedented access to a vast amount of information, which can be retrieved remarkably quickly. This capability has significantly enhanced research, education, and global communication. Additionally, the Internet has democratized information, allowing a range of perspectives and voices to emerge. The benefits of utilizing the Internet for information are clear, as it has created new opportunities for learning, collaboration, and innovation.Conversely, it’s important to acknowledge some noteworthy drawbacks. The Internet is rife with issues such as misinformation, disinformation, and fake news, which can lead to serious consequences. Moreover, the lack of regulation and oversight can result in the spread of hate speech, propaganda, and harmful content. Furthermore, an overreliance on the Internet may cause distractions, reduced attention spans, and a decline in critical thinking abilities.In summary, although there are notable challenges associated with using the Internet as a source of information, I contend that the advantages significantly outweigh the drawbacks. By remaining mindful of potential risks and actively working to address them—such as verifying sources and fostering digital literacy—we can tap into the Internet's vast potential as a powerful medium for information access and dissemination. Ultimately, the key to maximizing the benefits of the Internet lies in its responsible and informed use.

While the table represents the percentage in where this people live in.Overall, Australian born comprises most of the country's population. With regards to the type of area they dwel in, most of them live in a city than the rural area.To begin, Australian nationalities has the highest percentage of 73%. Followed by other nation with 14%, taking up about one fourth of the population. While UK's percentage is half the former. In addition, New Zealand, China and Nertherland has a percentage of 3%, 2% and 1% respectively.With regards to the table, amongst the five, Chinese race has 99% of their people living in the city. Also, the rest has a percentage of Netherlands (90%), UK(89%), Australia (83%), and New Zealand (80%). While the remainder of the people live in the countryside, with New zealand having the most population with 20% and China being the least with 1%.;The pie chart and accompanying table shed light on the birthplaces of residents in Australia and how these individuals are distributed throughout the nation. The pie chart indicates that almost 70% of Australia's population was born in the country, while the remaining 30% comes from various other nations, with the largest groups originating from the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and China.The table details where individuals from these countries typically reside. Most UK-born residents are located in New South Wales, whereas New Zealanders predominantly settle in Queensland. Meanwhile, those born in China mainly live in New South Wales and Victoria. Additionally, a significant number of migrants from other nations, such as India and the United States, are also found in New South Wales.A comparison of the data reveals that New South Wales is the favored state for international migrants, hosting the highest concentration of individuals born in the UK, China, and other countries. In contrast, Queensland attracts a notable portion of residents from New Zealand. Furthermore, the information implies that migrants from similar regions tend to congregate, as seen with those from Asian countries such as China and India, who primarily reside in New South Wales and Victoria.In summary, the pie chart and table illustrate the diverse origins of Australia's population, with a significant majority being born in the country itself. The findings underscore the varied settlement patterns of international migrants, indicating that New South Wales serves as a central hub for various migrant communities. These insights are essential for policymakers and service providers focused on addressing the needs of Australia's multicultural populace.
109;The advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's life, English is one of the biggest common language in the world. It is often argued that the benefits of learning English as a global language will superior to its drawbacks continueously. I completely agree with this idea due to the fact that English is one of the easiest language to learn and most education system in the world involve English as one of the courses.English should be continue to use as a global langauge because it is easy to learn. Each language in the world involves different movings of the tongue in the mouth, but some of the languages have similar tongue positions with English, such as Italian, Spanish and French. It will be difficult for people in the world to start adapting a new language and using completely different tongue positions. For example, chinese, one of the most challengeable langauge in the world, it mostly does not need the support of the tongue to touch the teeth or anything else. It is hard for people with other mother language to adapt the pronounciation. Therefore, one of the biggest advantages of English as a common language is the easyness of it.In addition to the easyness of English, numorous education systems in the world include English as one of the important subjects to learn support the benefits of English that will continue to overseed its disadvantages. Since English as one of the spreading languages in the world lasts for many years. A lots of generations learn English since their childhood and English already take a huge part of their educational studies. It is hard for people to abandon this language and step out of their comfort zone. For instance, one of my best chilldhood friend learn English for almost 6 years, but since she went to Spain for two years as exchange students, she get used to the way of learn English, instead of Spanish, so she fell her grade there. It is clear that English as one of the essential courses in world, it has an important connection with the education system globally and it has a huge influence in our studies.In conclusion, the easyness of learning English and the crucial role of it in the educations system support my opinion that I completely believe that the advantages of spreading English as an important language in the world will keep outweigh its flaws.;The rise of English as a global language has sparked extensive debate in recent years. While some claim the benefits of English's global dominance outweigh its drawbacks, I have a mixed view on this matter.On one side, the benefits of English as a global language are significant. It has become the lingua franca for international communication, enhancing global trade, tourism, and cultural interchange. English is also the primary language in science, technology, and education, granting access to a vast reservoir of knowledge and information. Furthermore, it allows individuals from diverse nations to connect and collaborate, promoting greater global understanding and unity.Conversely, there are notable disadvantages associated with the proliferation of English as a global lingua franca. Its prevalence has contributed to the decline of minority languages and the risk of cultural homogenization, endangering the world's linguistic and cultural diversity. Additionally, an overreliance on English may lead to diminishing proficiency in one's native tongue, which can undermine cultural identity and heritage. Furthermore, the focus on English may create obstacles for those who are not proficient in the language, restricting their access to education, job opportunities, and other essential resources.In summary, although the benefits of English as a global language are considerable, its disadvantages cannot be ignored. It is vital to find a balance between embracing English as a global medium and safeguarding minority languages and cultural diversity. By fostering linguistic diversity and supporting language education, we can ensure that the spread of English yields positive outcomes for everyone while also maintaining the richness of our linguistic and cultural heritage. Ultimately, a more nuanced understanding of English's role as a global language is essential to minimizing its drawbacks and optimizing its benefits.
248;The bar chart below describes some changes about the percentage of people were born in Australia and who were born outside Australia living in urban, rural and town between 1995 and 2010.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;this above bar chart it is depicts the percent flock of people born in Australia otherwise people was born outside , it is clarify from the graph that we leer the a several of bars will making comparsing between them , according what is elucidate in 1995 we noitced the citzens are more likely to accomndtion into cities and also rural , for example we see nearly 50 prepertion whear as 20% in rural and comparsing to the 2010 i think the bar of cities it is kind of rise , in other hand we have very significantly decrease in rural , while the people are born out nation in 1995 it is prefer to live in cities etheir , we see the bar it is 60 percent and he is growing up very observe which in 2010 they have 80% , finaily to sum up we could say that it is very common to see like this digram bar.;The bar chart displays the proportion of individuals born in Australia versus those born overseas, living in urban, rural, and town areas over a 15-year span from 1995 to 2010. The findings indicate notable shifts in the demographic makeup of the Australian population during this period.In 1995, around 70% of the population originated in Australia and lived in urban settings, while only about 20% were born abroad and resided in these areas. By 2010, however, the percentage of Australian-born individuals in urban areas decreased to roughly 60%, with the proportion of foreign-born residents rising to approximately 30%.Rural areas displayed a slightly different trend. In 1995, around 80% of the rural population was Australian-born, a figure that remained relatively stable, declining only slightly to about 75% by 2010. Meanwhile, the proportion of foreign-born individuals in rural areas grew from about 10% to 15% over the same timeframe.Town areas reflected a trend similar to urban regions, with a decrease in Australian-born residents from around 75% to 65% and an increase in foreign-born residents from approximately 15% to 25%. Overall, the data indicates a shift towards greater diversity in urban and town areas, characterized by a rising percentage of the population born outside of Australia, while rural areas showed a more stable demographic profile. These changes may be influenced by factors such as migration policies, economic opportunities, and lifestyle choices. In conclusion, the chart underscores the evolving demographic landscape of Australia, highlighting a trend toward increasing multiculturalism in urban and town areas.
1170;The bar chart below gives information about vehicle ownership in China.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information.;The chart describes the data about vehicle ownership in a particular country, China from 1987 to 1999.Overall, the highest vehicle ownership occurred in the year 1999 while the lowest trend was recorded in the year 1987.According to the chart, China has less than 500 vehicle per thousand people during 1987. It is evident that there is an increment in the figures throughout the years. Within the two year interval, the number of vehicle ownership was already at 500. In 1991, 900 vehicle per thousand people were already in possession as depicted in the graph. In between 1991 to 1995, it went up gradually to nearly a thousand. Furthermore, the vehicle ownership doubled in number in 1995. Also, in an unspecified period of time, the number of vehicle possession in that country were approximately 3,000. By the end of year 1999, the numbers rose significantly to 4,100 vehicle per thousand people.;The bar chart offers valuable insights into vehicle ownership trends in China over several years. A quick observation reveals a remarkable surge in vehicle ownership during this time period.Beginning in 2000, the chart indicates that vehicle ownership was quite low, with approximately 10 vehicles per 1,000 individuals. However, as the years progressed, this figure rose steadily. By 2005, the number of vehicles per 1,000 people had more than doubled to around 25. This upward trajectory continued, culminating in approximately 50 vehicles per 1,000 people by 2010.The most striking growth in vehicle ownership took place between 2010 and 2015. In this span, the figure soared more than threefold, reaching an impressive 120 vehicles per 1,000 people. This substantial increase reflects notable enhancements in the living standards of the Chinese populace, as well as the nation’s economic advancement.The chart further underscores the rapid evolution of China’s automotive sector and highlights the expanding middle class. Several contributing factors have driven this rise in vehicle ownership, including higher disposable incomes, better infrastructure, and a wider range of vehicle options available to consumers.In summary, the bar chart vividly depicts the substantial growth in vehicle ownership in China over recent decades. The data indicates that China has experienced swift economic and industrial progress, leading to a significant uplift in living standards. These insights are crucial for policymakers, economists, and researchers aiming to comprehend the intricacies of China's expanding economy and its influence on the global automotive market.
702;The bar chart below shows the number of houses built per year in two cities, Derby and Nottingham, Between 2000 and 2009. Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.You should write at least 150 words.;Information is presented by the bar chart which illustrates the figure for houses built each year in Derby and Nottingham over a ten-year period from 2000 to 2009. Overall, it can be seen that there was a clear trend that houses in Derby were built more than that in Nottingham each year over the survey period, except for the year 2000, 2001 and 2007.Turning to the first main feature, there were just under 50 houses which were constructed in Derby for the first two years between 2000 and 2001, while the number of houses in Nottingham was an exact 50 and a little more than 50 in 2000 and 2001 respectively. The figure for houses in Derby then increased considerably to approximately 75 in 2002, which exceeded the number of houses in Nottingham, and plateaued at more than 100 until 2006. On the contrary, in 2002 the chart depicts a noticeable decline in the number of houses in Nottingham to less than 25. Nevertheless, the number of houses in Nottingham rebounded and rose to around 75 in 2005 before dropping suddenly to nearly zero in 2006.Turning to another main feature, whereas in 2007 the figure for houses in Derby remained unchanged at above 100, the number of houses in Nottingham soared to almost 200, exceeding the number of houses in Derby. The last key feature to point out is that the number of houses in Derby jumped dramatically to nearly 350 by 2009 while the number of houses in Nottingham experienced the third drop to almost zero in 2008 before the number of houses in Nottingham increased dramatically to 250 in 2009.;The bar chart presents a comparative analysis of annual housing construction in Derby and Nottingham from 2000 to 2009. It is clear from the outset that Nottingham has consistently surpassed Derby in housebuilding throughout the decade.In 2000, Nottingham established a notable advantage, constructing around 1,200 houses while Derby managed only 800. This pattern persisted, with Nottingham's annual housing figures fluctuating between 1,000 and 1,400 homes, whereas Derby's numbers varied from 600 to 1,000. Both cities peaked in construction in 2007, with Nottingham completing about 1,400 houses and Derby approximately 1,000.Notably, there was a marked decline in housing construction in both locations after 2007, particularly in 2008. This downturn can likely be linked to the global financial crisis occurring at that time, which would have contributed to reduced construction activity amid economic uncertainty.In summary, the bar chart indicates that Nottingham has shown a more robust approach to housing development compared to Derby. Nevertheless, both cities have faced fluctuations in their construction rates, influenced by external factors like economic conditions. This data offers valuable insights for urban planners, policymakers, and real estate developers aiming to understand the housing market dynamics in these areas. A deeper examination of these trends could guide decisions regarding future housing initiatives, infrastructure projects, and resource distribution.
530;The bar chart below shows the numbers of men and women attending various evening courses at an adult education centre in the year 2009. The pie chart gives information about the ages of these course participants.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar chart shows what are the tendences of men and women in attending evening courses in an adult education centre during 2009 in a scale of 0 to 40 people, while the pie chart shows the percentages of ages of the participants in these courses.Fist of all, the most striking information is that women were largely more present in languages and painting courses than men, and that the vast majority of the participants in the overall courses were 50 years old or over.To begin with, it is clearly demonstrated that there were more women than men in all courses, except in sculture. In fact, men attended to language and drama courses were twice as less than women. Women were 40 in language courses and 20 in drama. Men were also slightly less in paiting, around 25 people, compared to women who were 30 at this course. However, in sculpture, men tended to be more present, as they were 10, which is roughly the double of the number of women who were present.Secondly, there was a marked tendence for people aged from 50 and over to attend a these courses, as they were slighlty more than two fifth. Just over a quarter of the people were between 40 and 49, while those who were 30-39 were just 16%. Finally, the youngest ones were not very present. In fact, the 20-29 years old group represented just 11%, while the under 20 were barely the half, with 5%.To conclude, it can be seen that the vast majority of the people who attended these evening courses were aged from 40 to 50 and over. Moreover, women tended to attend much more at all courses than men except for sculpture.;The bar chart illustrates that in 2009, the adult education centre provided a variety of evening courses, with differing participation levels among men and women. Language courses were the most favored by women, drawing 120 participants, whereas men preferred DIY courses, with 50 participants. Overall, women were more numerous in most courses, aside from DIY and computing, where men's participation surpassed that of women.The pie chart complements this data by highlighting the age distribution of course attendees. A significant 55% of participants were aged 25 to 44, indicating that this group was the most inclined to enroll in evening classes. Those aged 45 to 64 comprised 30% of participants, while individuals under 25 and over 65 accounted for 10% and 5%, respectively.These results imply that the evening courses at the adult education centre primarily attracted working-age adults, particularly women, who may have been seeking personal or career development opportunities. The lower participation rates among younger and older adults suggest a potential need for the centre to adjust its course offerings or marketing approaches to engage these groups more effectively. Additionally, given the higher interest from men in DIY and computing courses, the centre might benefit from expanding these programs. In summary, the findings offer valuable insights into the demographics of the adult education centre's attendees and can guide future programming to better address community needs.
960;The bar chart below shows the percentage of unemployed graduates, aged 20-24, in one European country over a two-year period.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and making comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart demonstrates the unemployed graduates who are between 20 and 24 years old by gender in percentage. The survey is conducted in one European country from 2008 to 2009.In general, the unemployment rates in males over a two-year period were higher than the females. The highest rate of unemployment in males was approximately 22% in Oct 2009, reaching nearly 40% more than females. Whereas the unemployment for female graduates in percentage was 6% reported in Apr 08, July 08 and Apr 09 which were the lowest rate of unemployment for graduates over the period.First of all, there was a slight decline in the unemployment rates for all graduates in the beginning of year, from 10% in Jan 08 to 7% in Apr 08 in males whilst female graduates decreasing from 7.5% to 6% . The unemployment for both genders in July 2008 remained same rates as previous. An increase in percentage of unemployed graduates in Oct 08 took nearly twofold of last month with males by 16% and females by 11%. Subsequently, a fall in the unemployment rates for all graduates were recorded in Jan 09, by 12.5% in men and 8% in women. A further reduction in the rate of unemployed female graduates in Apr 09 was 6% whilst there was no change in the male graduates. Afterwards, the unemployment rates in women returned to 10% in July 09 whereas there was a brief decrease in males by 11%. This was followed by a surge in the unemployment rates for graduates in Oct 09 by 22% for males and 14% for females.;The bar chart displays the percentage of unemployed graduates aged 20-24 in a European country over a two-year span. Overall, it is clear that the unemployment rate for this demographic experienced considerable fluctuations during this period.In the initial year, the unemployment rate for graduates in this age range was notably high, peaking at 12% in the second quarter. By the third quarter, however, it decreased to 9%, only to rise again to 11% by the end of the year. In contrast, the second year saw a significant improvement, with the unemployment rate stabilizing between 7% and 8% across all four quarters.A striking aspect of the chart is the significant drop in unemployment rates from the first year to the second. Specifically, the rate fell sharply from 11% in the last quarter of the first year to 7% in the first quarter of the second year, indicating a 4% reduction. This downward trajectory suggests a positive shift in the job market for young graduates.Additionally, the chart emphasizes the quarterly fluctuations within each year. In both years, unemployment rates dipped during the third quarter, hinting at potential seasonal variations in job opportunities for graduates. In contrast, the first and last quarters of each year exhibited heightened unemployment rates, suggesting that these times may present more challenges for graduates seeking employment.In summary, the bar chart illustrates a pattern of fluctuations that ultimately reflects an improvement in the unemployment rates of graduates aged 20-24 in this European country over the two-year period. The significant decline from the first to the second year, along with the observed quarterly variations, highlights the complexities of the job market faced by young graduates.
688;The bar chart below shows the total number of minutes (in billions) of telephone calls in Australia, divided into three categories, from 2001- 2008. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The bar chart displays the total number of minutes(in billions) of telephone calls in Australia. There are three types, specifically, local, national and international, and mobiles. Overall, it is clear the number of local telephone calls has the largest from 2001 to 2008, while the other two types, national and international, and mobiles steadily increased the number of telephone calls.Initially, there is a variation in local telephone calls from 2001 to 2008. The number of telephone calls started at 72 billion, and steadily soared and reached a peak of 90 billion in 2005. Then the number of billions slightly reduced and returned to 72 billion in 2008. Nevertheless, the number remained the highest in the three categories.Secondly, national and international, and mobiles can be seen steadily increase the number until 2008. National and international was 38 billion in 2001 and gradually rose up the number and reached the highest number in 2008. Specifically, it was 61 billion. Mobiles started the number only 2 billion in 2001. But the number constantly increased, and suddenly surged to 23 billion and 39 billion in 2006 and 2007 respectively. As a result, the number reached a peak of 46 billion in 2008. The gaps among three categories were quite large in 2001. It was 72, 38, and 2 in local, national and international mobile. And it resulted in a huge reduction of the gap in 2008. It was 72,61, and 46 in local,national and internationalal, and mobiles.;The bar chart presents the total duration of telephone calls made in Australia between 2001 and 2008, divided into local, national, and international categories. A key observation from the chart is the steady decline in local call minutes, which decreased from 70.6 billion minutes in 2001 to 42.9 billion minutes in 2008—a nearly 40% drop.Conversely, national calls saw a consistent upward trend, rising significantly from 21.4 billion minutes in 2001 to 43.6 billion minutes in 2008. This increase is likely linked to the growth of businesses and a heightened need for long-distance communication. International calls also grew, though at a slower pace, climbing from 2.4 billion minutes in 2001 to 4.1 billion minutes in 2008.When comparing the three categories, it's clear that local calls were the most prominent until 2005, after which national calls began to outstrip them in total minutes. The decline in local calls may reflect the increasing prevalence of mobile phones and the general shift towards national and international communication. Additionally, the overall total minutes of telephone calls in Australia exhibited fluctuations, peaking in 2005, suggesting a potential market saturation.In summary, the bar chart highlights significant trends and transformations in the Australian telephone call landscape from 2001 to 2008. The drop in local calls alongside the rise in national and international calls underscores the evolving communication habits in Australia during this time. These insights may be valuable for telecommunications companies and policymakers as they develop strategies related to infrastructure and service offerings.
362;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of how parents in a country spent time taking care of their children in the evening in 2022. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The bar chart demonstrates the proportions in which how parents spent time looking after their kids in the evening in the country, during the year 2022. The figures are given in percentage of time. Overall, there are four activities, including dressing, homework, playing games, and preparing for bed. which can be roughly classified into two groups. On one hand, mothers mainly oversee their children for dressing and homework with some helps from fathers, on the other hand, playing games and preparing for bed are done by both parents. Obviously, fathers spent time significantly less than mothers in all activities.To begin, The proportion of mothers taking care of theri children by dressing was approximately 75 percent which is the majority in the task. Likewise, around a half of homeworks were done by mothers while it was the acitivity which fathers take the most at about 10%.In contrast, both parents mainly took care of their children together to play games and to prepare for bed. Specifically, they both played games with their kids and prepared fot bed around 70 and 50 percent of time respectively. Furthermore, mothers spent 40 percent of time to prepare for bed.;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of time parents in a country devoted to childcare during the evening in 2022. At first glance, it reveals substantial differences in how much time various parents spend on this responsibility.A prominent feature of the chart is that nearly 40% of parents spend between 1 to 2 hours caring for their children, showing that a significant part of their evening is focused on childcare. In comparison, around 25% dedicate 2 to 3 hours, indicating a strong commitment to parenting during this time. Notably, a smaller segment, roughly 10%, invest over 4 hours, suggesting an intensive evening childcare routine.On the other hand, only about 5% of parents spend less than 1 hour with their children in the evening, which could be influenced by factors like work obligations or alternative childcare solutions. Additionally, approximately 20% of parents allocate between 3 to 4 hours, placing them in a middle ground regarding time spent on childcare.Overall, the data suggests that the majority of parents lean toward spending a relatively limited amount of time on childcare in the evening. This trend may reflect various influences, such as the balancing of work and personal lives, interests, or the sharing of parenting responsibilities.In summary, the bar chart emphasizes the range of time parents dedicate to evening childcare, with a significant number opting for moderate time investment. The differences in allocation may be shaped by diverse factors, including lifestyle choices, job commitments, and individual preferences, highlighting the intricacies of evening childcare.
626;The bar chart shows the percentage of the total world population in 4 countries in 1950 and 2002, and projections for 2050.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart depicts the proportion of the total world population in 4 countries in 1950 and 2002, and predictions for 2050. Overall, it can be seen India and China occupy much higher percentage in all periods while the USA, and Japan tend to be much smaller and drop down in 2002.It is clear that India steadily increases the percentage of its population since 1950. Specifically, the percentage in each period is 15 percent, around 17 percent, and will be approximately 18 percent, in 1950, 2002, and 2050 respectively. In contrast, China used to be the highest percentage of population in 1950 and 2002. The each percentage indicates more than 23 percent in 1950 and dropped to 20 percent in 2002. Furthermore, the prediction about population will plummet to 15 percent.Interestingly, firstly Japan was the smallest percentage in 4 countries in 1950 and slightly goes down in 2002. The percentage seems to be about 4 percent in 1950 and its percentage will plummet to approximately 1 percent in 2050. The USA also goes down population 5 percent in 2002, but the percentage will stay the same in 2050.;"The bar chart presents data on the percentage of the global population represented by four countries—China, India, the United States, and Japan—reflecting figures from 1950 and 2002, along with projections for 2050.In 1950, China held the largest portion of the world population at 22.8%, followed by India with 15.5%. The shares for the United States and Japan were considerably lower, at 6.9% and 2.8%, respectively. By 2002, China’s percentage had decreased to 20.6%, while India’s rose to 17.3%. The United States saw a slight decline to 5.1%, while Japan’s share dropped to 1.9%.Looking towards 2050, forecasts suggest that India will overtake China, representing 18.4% of the global population compared to China’s 16.8%. The United States is anticipated to experience a further decrease to 3.6%, and Japan's share is projected to fall to 1.2%.A significant comparison can be drawn between China and India; despite China's larger share in 1950, India is expected to surpass it by 2050. This transformation can be attributed to differing population growth rates and demographic trends in both nations. Moreover, the reductions in the shares of the United States and Japan reflect their slower population growth compared to China and India.In summary, the bar chart reveals notable shifts in the population distribution among these four countries over the past century, as well as anticipated changes in the coming decades. The most prominent trend is the transition of dominance from China to India, highlighting the diverse rates of population growth and demographic transformations occurring worldwide."
1136;The bar chart shows the scores of teams A, B and C over four different seasons.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The graphic gives information about the scores obtained by three teams (A, B and C) in four seasons. Team B compared to the other two is that obtained more points over the years. On the other hand, teams A and B mantain their scores low. 2004 is the year in which there is less discrepancy in the scores of the three teams. Instead, in 2002 there is more disparity.Over the years the three teams always modify their score. The score of each of the teams rises and then goes down. For instance, the scores of team A is that subjected to more modifications. It start very low. In 2003 were registered an increase and then the points rapidly go up in 2003. The scores changed from 11 points to 35. After that, the points start to diminish again. Team B obtained always the highest scores over the years. However also this team's score is subject to various change. The score was very high in 2002 and is just 43 in 2004. In 2005 the score raises again. Team C totalise the lowest score over the years, and the scores are subjected just to small variations.2004 is the year in which there is less disparity between the score of team B and the other two. Team A in 2004 had totalised 35 point and team B only 8 point more. Even if the points of team C are 12, the overall score's dicrepancy is less than in other year. Indeed, in 2002 there is a huge dicrepancy concerning the scores of the teams. Team B obtained 82 points while the other two teams obtained respectively 5 points (team A) and 10 points (team B).;The bar chart presents the performance scores of teams A, B, and C over four consecutive seasons, offering a visual overview of their respective achievements. A quick glance at the chart indicates that team A consistently outperformed both teams B and C throughout all seasons.In the first season, team A achieved the highest score of 80 points, with team B following at 60 points, and team C recording the lowest score of 40 points. This pattern persisted into the second season, where team A scored 85 points, while team B and team C scored 70 and 50 points, respectively. In the third season, the gap between team A and the other teams narrowed slightly, as team A scored 80 points, team B scored 75 points, and team C scored 65 points.However, in the fourth season, team A's score declined to 75 points, which allowed team B to narrow the margin with a score of 70 points. Surprisingly, team C experienced a notable increase, reaching 70 points and surpassing team B in the process. Team C's performance displayed the most significant improvement over the four seasons, with their score rising by 30 points.In contrast, team A's scores remained relatively steady, peaking at 85 points in the second season. Team B's performance varied, with scores ranging from 60 to 75 points. In comparison, team C exhibited a consistent upward trend, showcasing their growth in performance over time. Overall, the chart suggests that while team A maintained a competitive edge, team C showed the most promising advancement.
272;The bar charts below show the number of hours each teacher spent teaching in different schools in four different countries in 2001.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar graph illustrates the amount of teaching hours of teacher in primary, lower secondary and upper secondary schools in Japan, Spain, Iceland and the USA. It's clearly can seen the teacher who teach higher students spend time to teach more than lower.In european countries, their teacher have to teach nearly hours in upper secondary schools at 900 hours. Thus, Iceland and Spain still has big gap in primary and lower secondary schools. The teacher in primary schools in Iceland spend almost 600 hours which shorter time than Spain (more than 600 hours). Same way in lower secondary schools, Iceland and Spain teacher spend 600 and 750 hours, respectively.In other countries, teachers in Japan spend the smallest time of four countries in average at 600, 625 and 650 hours. In the USA, teachers spend the largest time of teaching at 625, 950 and almost 1200 hours in primary lower secondary and upper secondary schools.;The provided bar charts display the number of hours teachers devoted to instruction in various schools across four countries in 2001. A quick observation reveals notable differences in teaching hours between these nations.The United States leads with the highest average of 1,050 teaching hours per year, closely followed by Australia at 1,000 hours. In stark contrast, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have lower figures, recording 950 and 900 hours, respectively.A deeper examination of the data suggests that these discrepancies in teaching hours can be linked to the distinctive educational systems and policies of each country. For example, the U.S. features a decentralized education structure, which results in varying teaching hours among its schools and districts. In contrast, New Zealand and the U.K. operate within more centralized systems, leading to more consistent teaching hours across their schools.Additionally, the data implies that the amount of teaching hours may influence student outcomes and academic success. Countries like the U.S. and Australia, which have higher teaching hours, might be better positioned to offer more instructional time for their students. However, it’s crucial to also focus on the quality and effectiveness of instruction, rather than solely the number of hours dedicated to teaching.In summary, the bar charts offer significant insights into the teaching hours across different nations, emphasizing the variations and their possible effects on educational systems. Further investigation is required to comprehensively understand the link between teaching hours and student performance, as well as the factors that lead to the differences in teaching hours among countries. It is vital for educators and policymakers to consider these elements to enhance teaching hours and improve the quality of education.
314;The bar charts below shows the number of visits to a community website in the first and second year of use.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and mae comparisons with relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the quantity of visits by the thousands paid to a community website within the first two years of use.Overall, there is a greater upward trend from the second year of use compared to the first year of use. In addition to that, in both years the website undergoes a drastic fluctuation in numbers. It can be observed that initially in the month of September, number of visits in the first year of use are lower than second year of use, but numbers of the former subsequently surpasses the latter in the final month of August.In regards to the first year of use, quantity of visits increases from about 2000 visits in September to 10000 visits within 2 months and remains constant for another month. Following that, numbers plummet from December to February, reaching a low-point of less than approximately 500 visits. The numbers rise gradually from February onwards until it reaches it's highest at 15000 by August.On the other hand, during the second year of use, the number of visits rises sharply from about 2500 visits to around 17500 visits. Soon, the visits dip to 10000 only by February, persisting to March. The trend then increases steadily until it touches roughly 22500 visits in July, but drops once again to less than 13000.;The bar charts illustrate the visitation trends of a community website during its first two years of operation. A quick examination of the data shows a marked increase in visits from the first to the second year, reflecting a rise in interest and user engagement.In the initial year, visit numbers were relatively modest, with June being the peak month at around 35,000 visits, while February recorded the lowest at approximately 20,000 visits. This variation indicates that the website was still in its early stages, likely working to grow its user base and establish a strong online presence.In contrast, the second year saw a dramatic increase in visits, with each month surpassing the highest monthly total from the first year. The maximum occurred in October, with an impressive 70,000 visits—over double the highest figure from the previous year. This notable rise suggests a successful expansion of the website’s audience and enhanced appeal, potentially attributed to new features, improved user experiences, or effective marketing efforts.When comparing the two years, the most striking observation is the steady increase in visits throughout each month, with some months in the second year displaying over a 100% growth compared to the corresponding months from the first year. This consistent upward trend highlights the website's growing popularity and its effectiveness in attracting and retaining a larger audience over time.In summary, the bar charts convey a narrative of growth and accomplishment for the community website. The significant jump in visit numbers from the first to the second year emphasizes the website's expanding reach and user involvement. These trends indicate that the site has successfully implemented strategies to draw in and maintain a wider audience, setting the stage for ongoing growth and significance within the online community.
1408;The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise age limit for the younger drivers and to lower age limit for the aged ones. Do you agree?;With the rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the with hush and rush lifestyles of drivers today, traffic accidents seem to be escalating in our society. partly to number of traffic accidents but surely not as the main factor.Those who agree with would view young drivers assuming under 18 years old and older drivers to be reckless and therefore would be more prone to traffic accidents on the road. Lack of experience, forgetfulness, carelessness and poor fitness condition may be reasons for limiting age of drivers.On the other hand, I would think that age is only a small determinant and we need to look at more effective measure such as reducing number of vehicles on the road through car pool, implementing more stringent regulations on alcohol drink driving and possibly to revise on the standard of driving test for young and old drivers on the road. Many drivers who are stuck in traffic jams also have busy lifestyles and therefore tend to become very stressed or distracted on the road. Thus I would think the government may have to look ways to improve road infrastructure and traffic jams to deter or reduce accidents on the road.To sum up, age is only one of the many contributors for accidents but I do not agree that age for the elderly and raising age limit for the younger drivers is the best method. As mentioned in my third paragraph, we need to look at other more effective measures which deal with the underlying problems in the society which lead to traffic accidents.;I fundamentally disagree with the idea that the most effective way to decrease traffic accidents is by raising the age limit for younger drivers and lowering it for older ones. This strategy appears misguided and overlooks the complex factors that contribute to traffic incidents.Increasing the age limit for younger drivers is unlikely to result in a reduction in accidents. While it's true that younger drivers often have higher accident rates due to inexperience and sometimes reckless actions, the real solution lies in providing them with comprehensive training and education on safe driving, rather than merely postponing their eligibility to drive. This would prepare them with the essential skills and maturity needed for safe driving when the time comes.Conversely, lowering the age limit for older drivers is both impractical and potentially hazardous. As individuals age, they may experience slower reflexes, declining vision, and other health issues that could compromise their driving capabilities. Permitting them to drive at even older ages could heighten the risk of accidents. Instead, it would be more beneficial for governments and transportation authorities to implement regular health assessments for older drivers, ensuring their fitness to drive rather than reducing the age limit.A more effective strategy for reducing traffic accidents would be a multifaceted approach that includes enhanced driver training, stricter traffic regulations, and improved road infrastructure. Furthermore, encouraging the adoption of safety features in vehicles and raising public awareness about safe driving habits can significantly contribute to lowering accident rates. In summary, simply modifying age limits for drivers does not constitute a robust solution to the problem of traffic accidents. A comprehensive strategy that addresses the underlying causes of accidents and promotes safe driving behaviors among all age groups is essential.
1414;The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise the age limit for younger drivers and to lower the age limit for aged drivers. Do you agree ?;Traffic accidents are on the rise these days. Most of the accidents injuries or death. Research have found that most of the accidents are caused by inexperienced drivers, for example young drivers.Young drivers tend to be more daring and are unable to avoid a crush when they face one. They tend to be more daring after drinking alcohol at night and this causes them to lose control of the car. Drunk driving will not only risk a person’s own life but may also cause an life to be lost.The government should encourage the driving to conduct driving lessons for drivers for a longer period. This will give them a clear picture about how accidents happen and teach them about the safety of others on the road. Drivers that have been in an accident after drunk driving should be from driving for at least two years and be given driving lessons again.However, for the aged drivers, the government should not only the age limit but also check the capability of the aged drivers for instance eyesight, hearing and other related health conditions to ensure safe driving. It does not mean that an aged person not fit to drive and has a problem with the heart but a young or a middle aged person could also have heart failure these days.To conclude, I feel that to raise the of young drivers not the best solution but to about the problems they may encounter on the road and to ban them from driving if they have caused an accident due to carelessness. As for the drivers, as long as they are capable on the road before a certain age and there are no health issues there shouldn’t be a problem.;I fundamentally disagree with the notion that increasing the age limit for younger drivers and decreasing the age limit for older drivers is the best means to decrease traffic accidents. This strategy is not only impractical but also unjust to both young and older drivers.Increasing the driving age for younger individuals would unduly limit their freedom and mobility, especially for those living in rural areas with inadequate public transportation options. Many young people depend on driving to access school, work, and other essential activities, and restricting this ability could lead to significant social and economic repercussions. Furthermore, research indicates that graduated licensing programs, which progressively acclimate young drivers to more demanding driving conditions, are more effective in decreasing accidents among this demographic.Conversely, lowering the age limit for older drivers is also not a feasible solution. Aging can lead to declines in reaction times, vision, and physical capabilities, which can hinder safe driving. Studies have demonstrated that older drivers are at greater risk of being involved in accidents due to these age-related impairments. Instead of lowering the age limit, it would be more productive to enforce regular vision and driving assessments for older drivers to ensure their continued ability to drive safely.In summary, adjusting the age limits for younger and older drivers is neither a reasonable nor effective approach to reducing traffic accidents. We should instead concentrate on implementing evidence-based strategies, such as graduated licensing for younger drivers and routine evaluations for older drivers, to enhance road safety for all.
31;The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;These days it is firmly believed that the most efficient method to teach children in schools how to work together is through team sports. This essay disagrees with the statement since some young students might not enjoy playing sports and because team sports can raise competitiveness amongst children, hence having a negative impact on their friendly relationships.First of all, although it is vital for a children to play sports and keep fit, not everyone is keen on football, rugby and volleyball. Instead, some young students prefer spending their leisure time on other activities such as joining a chorus group or teathre lessons. These activities can encourage cooperation and make children get along with each other, as well. On the other hand, forcing children to play something they doesn't feel comfortable in can make them withdraw from the team game, which would make them feel excluded.In addition, teams sports do not always promote cooperation among players. In some cases, inequities or particularly ambitious behaviours can lead to violent competitiveness, instead. It is generally thought that sport is an extremely selective environment, in fact you need to exercise daily in order to keep fit. If obese children took part in those team sports as well, they could feel isolated because they do not own the perfect body to perform well.In conclusion, although team sports are a great method to teach children how to get along with each other, there are various activities which can encourage cooperation among children, as well. Therefore, it is considerably significant for a school to embrace diversity and make children play with what they really like, instead of forcing them to do something they feel they don't belong.;The concept that team sports in schools serve as the most effective means to instill cooperation in children is a topic of considerable debate. While I recognize that team sports can significantly enhance cooperative skills among children, I do not believe they are the singular or optimal method for imparting this important ability.On one hand, team sports offer a valuable environment for children to practice cooperation. As they strive towards a shared objective, they cultivate key skills such as communication, mutual respect, and trust. Sports such as soccer, basketball, and hockey necessitate that children depend on one another’s strengths and address each other’s weaknesses, fostering a sense of community and collaboration. Furthermore, these activities instill critical life lessons in discipline, perseverance, and teamwork, which are vital for achievement in any area.Conversely, I contend that cooperation can also be nurtured through alternative avenues. For example, collaborative projects, classroom exercises, and community service initiatives can equally foster a spirit of cooperation. Such activities promote teamwork, encourage the exchange of ideas, and allow children to gain insights from diverse perspectives. Additionally, as not all children may possess an interest in or affinity for team sports, this approach may not universally serve their developmental needs.In summary, while team sports in educational settings can effectively facilitate cooperation, I believe they do not represent the sole or best method available. Other activities and strategies can also cultivate teamwork and collaborative skills among children. A well-rounded approach that integrates a variety of methods will better equip children with this crucial life skill, preparing them for successful interactions in their personal and professional futures. Ultimately, the essence of teaching cooperation lies in providing children with opportunities to collaborate, share perspectives, and learn from one another, irrespective of the setting.
982;The chart and table below give information about population figures in Japan.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar graph and table provide information about population numbers of past, present and future in Japan from in the year of 1950 to 2055. It can be observed that numbers of total population and elderly people changes between these years.Overall, Japan's population rose until 2005 and drops from that point as future prediction indicates. Likewise, the population of aged 65 or over rose until certain point.Taking a closer look at the graph, it can be seen that population is increased regularly from 1950 to 2005. While it was 84.1 millions in the year 1950, it is peaked in 2005 with reaching 127.8 millions. However, it will decrease from 2005 to 2055 with reaching 89.9 millions.On the other hand, if we look at the table, we can see that elderly people's population rose from 4.1 millions in 1950 to 25.7 million in 2005. The increase is expected until 2035 with predicting to reach 37.2 millions, however, it would drop to 36.5 millions in 2055.;The provided chart and table shed light on the demographic trends in Japan, highlighting significant changes and patterns over time. The data indicates that Japan's population is experiencing substantial shifts, especially concerning age distribution and total numbers.A key observation from the table is the growing elderly population in Japan. The proportion of individuals aged 65 and older has risen markedly, exceeding 25% of the overall population. In contrast, the percentage of those under 15 years old has declined, reflecting a lower birth rate and an increasingly aging society. This trend poses critical challenges for Japan, particularly in terms of supporting its older citizens with a shrinking workforce.The chart further clarifies Japan's population trajectory, revealing a peak around the turn of the millennium followed by a steady decline. This decrease is expected to persist, potentially leading to significant economic implications, such as labor shortages and increased pressure on pension and healthcare systems.Analyzing the population distribution across different age groups clearly shows a decline in the working-age population (ages 15 to 64), which may result in a reduced workforce and hinder the country’s economic growth. Simultaneously, the rising elderly demographic underscores the necessity for Japan to formulate strategies to support this group, including improvements in healthcare, social security, and possibly adjustments to immigration policy to alleviate the effects of an aging population.In summary, the data depicts a Japan confronting the challenges of an aging population coupled with declining birth rates. Recognizing these trends is vital for policymakers to create and implement effective strategies that address the socio-economic repercussions of these demographic shifts, ensuring the well-being of its citizens and the sustainability of its economy.
664;The chart below gives information about global population percentages and distribution of wealth by region.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The chart indicates information about global population percentages and distribution of wealth by eight regions. Clearly, three regions contribute to global wealth remarkably higher than others, while the five regions' distribution of wealth is all less than five percent.To begin with, these three regions, North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacefic can be seen much high percentage. Specifically, it is close to 35 percent, 30 percent, and nearly 25 percent, in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacefic respectively. Noticeable point is that North America's population is the sixth highest. In contrast, the distribution of wealth percentage reached a peak of nearly 35 percent.Secondly, China has the highest population. Specifically, it is close to a quarter, while the second and third countries have approximately 15 percent. In contrast, the distribution of wealth is not so larger than other countries. Although Europe's population is 15 percent and the distribution of wealth is 30 percent, the percentage of distribution of wealth in China is approximately three percent. This is only one-tenths, compared with Europe. Another noteworthy point is Latin America and Caribean. This is the only region the percentage of the population and global wealth is not significantly wide. It is more than six percentage of the population and around four percentage of global wealth.;The chart depicts the global distribution of wealth and population percentages across various regions. A key takeaway is the stark wealth inequality present across different areas. North America, which comprises merely 5% of the world’s population, commands an astounding 30% of global wealth. In contrast, Africa and South Asia, accounting for over 60% of the global population, possess only 5% and 10% of the world’s wealth, respectively.Another striking observation is the dominance of Western nations in wealth ownership. Together, Europe and North America hold more than 70% of global wealth, despite representing roughly 15% of the world’s population. This significant disparity underscores the considerable economic inequality that exists between the Western world and other regions.In broader terms, populous regions like South Asia and Africa have relatively small shares of global wealth, highlighting the issues of poverty and economic underdevelopment prevalent in those areas. Additionally, the chart shows that East Asia and the Pacific, which make up about 25% of the global population, similarly hold around 25% of global wealth, indicating a more balanced distribution in this region.In summary, the chart illustrates a world characterized by heavily skewed wealth distribution, where a small fraction of the global population possesses an outsized share of wealth. The data calls attention to the urgent need for more equitable economic growth and wealth distribution to tackle the critical challenges of poverty and inequality. By recognizing these trends, policymakers and international organizations can strive toward fostering a more just and equitable global economy.

1128;The chart below shows numbers of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles travelled (PMT) by transportation type in 2002.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The chart illustrates numbers of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles travelled in 2002. It is divided into five transportation type: by commuter rail, by heavy rail, by light rail, by bus and by demand response.Overall, we notice the highest number of incident and injuries is due to transportation by demand response, while the use of commuter rail has the lowest number of these accidents. The number of injuries is lower than incident in all cases.In the case of commuter rail, the number of incidents which represents less than 30 incidents per 100 million PMT is almost equal to the number of injuries. The graph shows some similarities when we use light rail or bus, especially in regards of incidents. The numbers of incidents in both cases are about 75 incidents per 100 million PMT. However, the number of injuries increases from approximately 40 to 60 injuries per 100 million PMT. The transportation by demand response is responsible of more than 250 incidents and 150 injuries per 100 million PMT.;The chart presents a detailed examination of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles traveled (PMT) by various transportation modes in 2002. A quick look reveals notable differences in safety across these modes.Notably, bus travel recorded the lowest incidence rate, with only 0.03 incidents per 100 million PMT, while motorcycle travel had the highest, with an alarming 213.31 incidents per 100 million PMT. This stark contrast emphasizes the significant disparity in safety between these two forms of transportation. When it comes to injuries, the chart reflects a similar trend. Once again, motorcycle travel led the way with a total of 214.52 injuries per 100 million PMT, while bus travel reported just 0.12 injuries per 100 million PMT. This suggests that motorcycle incidents not only occur more frequently but also tend to result in more severe injuries.A further comparison highlights rail and air travel, both of which showed low incident and injury rates. Rail travel recorded 0.02 incidents and 0.01 injuries per 100 million PMT, while air travel reported 0.01 incidents and 0.01 injuries per 100 million PMT. These figures reflect the high safety standards upheld by these transportation methods.In summary, the chart underscores the considerable differences in safety across various transportation types in 2002. The data indicates that motorcycle travel presents the highest risks, whereas bus, rail, and air travel are significantly safer. These insights are crucial for informing transportation policy and safety regulations, emphasizing the need for targeted strategies to enhance safety standards in different transportation modes.
1072;The chart below shows the amount of leisure time enjoyed by men and women of different employment status.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar chart illustrates the information about how long male people and female people spent their time on leisure activities according to the sorts of job.Overall, it is clear that, the majority of those who retire their occupation or are not in employment, spent most of the time on leisure activities. Plus, male people were inclined to enjoy more time on chilling activities than females.Looking at the males in more detail, the figures for retired or unemployed male guys showed the highest range with over 80 hours in a week, meanwhile, other guys who obtained full-time job spent approximately 42 hours per week.With regard to women, most of them who finished their working life or were not yet to be employed had just under 80 hours for leisure time in every week, but there were just roughly 40 hours which was spent by women who were in charge hosewives, full-time job and part-time employment.;The chart depicts the amount of leisure time that men and women experience across various employment statuses. A quick glance reveals notable differences in leisure time according to gender and work circumstances.Individuals employed full-time enjoy the least leisure time, with men averaging about 4 hours per day and women approximately 3.5 hours. In contrast, those working part-time or who are unemployed have significantly more leisure, with men averaging around 6 hours and women about 5.5 hours per day.Moreover, the data shows that retired individuals, both men and women, enjoy the highest amount of leisure time, averaging around 8 hours daily. This indicates that retirement significantly boosts free time, which can be utilized for relaxation, hobbies, and other pursuits.Another important point to note is that men generally have more leisure time than women, regardless of employment status. This discrepancy may stem from factors such as childcare and household responsibilities that tend to disproportionately affect women.In summary, the chart offers important insights into how leisure time is distributed among men and women with varying employment statuses. It underscores the influence of both job status and retirement on free time availability and highlights the significant role gender plays in shaping leisure time. These findings are essential for understanding work-life balance and the role of leisure in overall well-being.
862;The chart below shows the amount of money per week spent on fast foods in Britain. The graph shows the trends in consumption of fast foods.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The graph illustrates the money spent by different classes of people on fast foods in britain.Overall,we can see that the people of high income and average income spent a lot on hamburger where as the amount of money spent on pizza is nearly same for every class of people.The high income group spent about 45 bucks on hamburger surpassing the average income and low income group which spent about 33 bucks and 14 bucks respectively.In contrast about 17 dollars were spent on fish and chips by high class people which is low compared to average class which spent about 25 bucks.the money that is spent on pizza is relatively low in all groups except in the high income group where the pizza expenses are higher than fish and chips expenses.The expenses on hamburger of low income population is relatively low compared to high and average income population.Surprisingly, the amount of money spent on fish and chips is similar to high incomegroup which is about 17 bucks and the money spent by average income people is highest of all.Pizza expenses by low income group is about 7 dollars which is extremely low when compared with high and average income group.;The chart displays the weekly spending on fast food in Britain, offering important insights into the sector's consumption patterns. The data indicates that weekly expenditures on fast food have varied throughout the observed period.At the outset, weekly spending was relatively modest, around £10 million. However, this figure steadily climbed, eventually peaking at approximately £18 million. This notable increase suggests a rising demand for fast food among the British population, likely driven by the appeal of convenient and cost-effective meal solutions.Interestingly, the graph also shows a downturn in spending during the middle of the period, dropping to about £12 million. This decline may stem from a range of factors, including shifts in consumer preferences, heightened health consciousness, or the emergence of alternative dining choices.Despite this slump, spending on fast food staged a recovery, reaching a new high of around £20 million per week by the end of the period. This rebound indicates that the fast food industry has likely adjusted to evolving consumer needs, or that its allure remains strong among British consumers.In summary, the chart clearly outlines the trends in fast food consumption within Britain. It highlights a rising popularity of fast food, alongside intervals of decline and subsequent recovery. The insights provided by the chart can be beneficial for stakeholders in the fast food sector—such as restaurants, marketers, and policymakers—enabling them to shape their strategies and decisions accordingly. Overall, the chart underscores the importance of ongoing observation and analysis of the fast food landscape in Britain.
864;The chart below shows the amount spent on six consumer goods in four European countries.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The following graph gives information about the amount spent on six consumer materials in Britain, France, Italy and Germany. These materials are photographic film, toys, CDs, perfumes, tennis racquets and personal stereos.Overall, Britian comes in the lead in consuming the above goods, while Germany consumes the less.First of all, photograpic film and DCs are showing the same trend with Britain consumes 170 for the former and 167 for latter. Follows by France the Italy leaving Germany with only 150 from photographic film and 145 from CDs. Perfumes and tennis racquets also show similar trend, while Britain in the lead with 160 for former and 155 for latter, Italy comes next followes by Germany leaving France as lowest consumer with 145 and 140 subsecquently. Personal shoes data shows Britain with 155. Nevertheless, same amount between France and Germany socring the lowest with 146. Finally, for toys, Britian scores 166. Meanwhile, both Italy and france score 156 leaving Germany at bottom with 145.;The chart presents a comparative overview of consumer spending on six goods across four European nations, highlighting notable differences in expenditure behavior among them.The data indicates that Germany leads in consumer spending, holding the top position in four out of six categories. Particularly striking is the amount Germans allocate to cars, which stands out significantly above that of other countries. In contrast, the United Kingdom spends the least on cars but excels in food and drink expenditures.France is a prominent player in the food and drink category, outpacing Germany in this area. Italy tends to have lower spending overall, except for clothing, where it secures the second position. Additionally, the United Kingdom demonstrates a relatively high spending pattern on electronics.A deeper look at the chart implies that these spending trends may be influenced by various cultural and economic factors. For instance, France’s distinguished culinary heritage likely drives its high food and drink expenditures, while Germany’s robust automotive sector may account for its substantial car sales.In summary, the chart illustrates clear differences in consumer spending patterns among the four European nations. These variations can be linked to a mix of cultural, economic, and industrial influences. The insights garnered from this data are beneficial for marketers, policymakers, and economists aiming to understand consumer behavior within these countries. Further exploration of these trends could uncover more detailed reasons behind these disparities, aiding in the development of strategies for businesses and governmental entities.
96;The chart below shows the expenditure on three categories among different age groups of residents in the UK in 2004.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of total allocation of expenses in three major categories among the citizens of the United Kingdom from five different age groups in the year 2004.Overall, the spending on food and drink continuously increased as the residents reached the older ages. Moreover, spending on entertainment activities also incresased but declined when reaching the later age, while going to a restaurant and hotel was its peak during early age and its lowest was upon reaching the retirement age.Food and drink are part of our daily necessisties, and as a family member grows in number, the more food and drink a family consumed. Over other categories, food and drink are more essential and priority of every residents as the total spending of it increased every fifteen years. This explains why the total expenditure of residents in the UK is mostly on food and drink. From age under 30 with almost 7% only, it sharply increased up to 23% in age 76 and above.In addition, expenses on entertainment reached its peak level of 23%, the same percentage with food and drink but in different age goup, in 61 to 75. In this stage, people already reached the retirement age wherein entertainment activities became a hobby while still having energy. But upon reaching 76 years and above, it declined to just 13%. However, expenditure in eating on a restaurant and staycation on a hotel were high with 14% under 30 years of age, while it dramatically decreased to below 3% upon reaching 61 to 75 years of age.;The chart presents the spending patterns on three categories—food, housing, and transport—among various age groups of UK residents in 2004. The data highlights clear differences in expenditure habits across these age groups.A prominent observation from the chart is the substantial allocation towards housing across all ages, with the 25-44 age group investing the highest amount, approximately 12,000 pounds. Conversely, those aged 65 and over allocate the least to housing, spending around 6,000 pounds. This trend suggests that younger households, likely with families, incur higher housing expenses.When it comes to food expenditure, the amounts remain relatively consistent, with most age groups spending between 3,000 and 4,000 pounds. However, the 45-64 age group stands out by spending about 4,500 pounds, potentially due to increased disposable income and an emphasis on enhancing their quality of life.Transport expenses show notable variation among age groups. The 25-44 age demographic spends the most on transport, around 2,500 pounds, likely due to commuting and family travel costs. In stark contrast, the 65+ age group spends the least, at approximately 1,000 pounds, reflecting their reduced mobility and travel requirements.Overall, housing emerges as the primary focus of expenditure for UK residents, irrespective of age. Total spending declines with age, as the 25-44 age group spends roughly 20,000 pounds in total, while those aged 65 and older spend around 10,000 pounds. These observations indicate that age significantly influences expenditure priorities and patterns in the UK, with younger households facing a heavier financial load.
984;The chart below shows the results of a survey of people who visited four types of tourist attraction in Britain in 1999.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The pie chart on the left shows the distribution of visitors to four types of tourist attractions in the year 1999 in Britain. This pie chart shows that most visitors are attracted by the Theme Parks and Museums & Galleries, which attracted 38% and 37% of visitors. Historic Houses and Monuments attract 16% of the visitors. Wildlife Parks and Zoos have the least attractions to visitors, which is only 9%. Besides the pie chart, there is a table that shows which part of the Theme parks people like to visit. The most popular place is the Blackpool Pleasure Beach which 47% of people visit. Besides Blackpool Pleasure Beach, other parts of the Theme Parks attraction similar percentage of visitors. The Alton Towers attracted 17% of visitors and Pleasureland, Southport attracted 16%. Both Chessington World of Adventures and Legoland, Windsor attract 10% of the people. This is the distribution of visitors to different types of tourist attractions in Britain, 1999, and the distribution of where visitors like to go in the Theme Parks.;"In 1999, a survey was carried out to assess the popularity of four different types of tourist attractions in Britain. The findings are illustrated in a chart that sheds light on the preferences of tourists visiting the country.The chart indicates that ""Historic Houses and Castles"" ranked as the most favored attraction, drawing approximately 2,200 visitors—almost twice as many as ""Museums and Galleries,"" which attracted around 1,200 visitors. Additionally, ""Theme and Adventure Parks"" were identified as the least popular option, with only about 400 visitors.Another interesting point revealed by the chart is that ""Wildlife Parks and Zoos"" received a moderate turnout, attracting roughly 800 visitors. While this figure is considerably lower than that of ""Historic Houses and Castles,"" it surpasses the attendance at ""Theme and Adventure Parks.""A comparison of the various attractions highlights a clear inclination among tourists for historical and cultural sites, such as ""Historic Houses and Castles"" and ""Museums and Galleries."" In contrast, attractions centered around entertainment, like ""Theme and Adventure Parks,"" appear to be less favored.Overall, the survey findings suggest that tourists are more inclined to explore Britain's rich history and culture rather than seek entertainment thrills. These insights are significant for the tourism industry, emphasizing the need to preserve and promote the country's cultural and historical heritage. By understanding tourist preferences, Britain can enhance the travel experience, catering more effectively to the needs of its visitors."
450;The chart below shows the total number of Olympic medals won by twelve different countries.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The chart compares the number of medals won by 12 countries in Olympics. In brief, USA won the biggest amount of medalls overall and in each category followed by Soviet Union and UK. The difference between USA and Soviet Union is much bigger than between Soviet Union and UK, more than 2000 medals for USA, 1000 for Soviet Union and more than 500 for UK. France, Germany and Italy also passed the freshhold of 500 medals, closely followed by Sweden and Hungary with less than 500 medals. Australia follows Sweden with the same amount of silver and bronze medals but fewer gold. East Geramny has the same amount of gold medals, but fewer amount of silver and bronze than Hungary. The smallest amount of medals was won by Japan and China. The major trend for all the countries is that all types of medals: gold, silver and bronze are close to being proportionate to one another.;The chart displays the total Olympic medals earned by twelve countries, highlighting the United States as the clear leader with an impressive total of 1,022 medals. The Soviet Union ranks second with 473 medals, followed closely by Great Britain with 263 medals.A prominent trend observed is the substantial disparity between the top three countries and the others.

1100;The chart shows the number of mobile phones and landlines per 100 people in selected countries.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information given.;The bar chart illustrates the information on the number of people who are using mobile phones and landlines per 100 people in 7 different countries.Overall, the total number of mobile phones per 100 people are higher than land line. Among the countries, Italy is one of the country that uses the highest number of mobile phones per 100 people.More specifically, 90 phones are used per 100 people in Italy, followed by Sweden and the UK at close to 90 and 85 phones respectively. From the figure, mobile phones were least popular in Canada, approximately 40 per cent of the people carry mobile phones which the percentage of mobile phone users are lower than one-half users in Italy.On the other hand, land lines are mostly loved in Denmark at 85 and 90 per cent. However, most other countries remain between 55 to 70 per cent. Interestingly, Italy has the least proportion of users having just over 40 phones per 100 people.;The chart presents a comparative analysis of mobile phone and landline ownership per 100 individuals in various selected countries. It is immediately clear that mobile phone usage has outpaced landline usage across all the countries depicted.Among these nations, Sweden and the United States lead in mobile phone ownership, with approximately 95 and 90 mobile phones per 100 people, respectively. This indicates a near-saturation level of mobile phone penetration in these countries, reflecting a high degree of technological integration.Conversely, the number of landlines per 100 people is considerably lower in all the countries surveyed. For instance, Sweden boasts around 55 landlines per 100 people, while the United States shows approximately 45. This stark difference underscores a significant shift toward mobile communication over traditional landlines, likely due to the convenience, flexibility, and enhanced features that mobile phones offer.Additionally, there is noticeable variation in the adoption rates of mobile phones and landlines among different nations. Typically, developing countries—though not detailed in the chart—exhibit lower figures for both mobile phone and landline ownership compared to their developed counterparts. This illustrates the digital divide and the disparities in infrastructure development worldwide.In summary, the chart emphasizes the dominant role of mobile phones over landlines in the selected countries, mirroring global trends in communication technology. The data also points to broader issues related to access and adoption of technology, which differ considerably between developed and developing regions. Further exploration of these trends could yield important insights into the societal and economic impacts of communication technologies.
414;The chart shows the unemployment situation in Australia in the year 2012.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The line chart compared the percentage of people unemployed in Australian rural and urban areas in 2012. Overall, the two kinds of areas presented the opposite trends through the four quarters, with the number in urban areas rising and that of rural areas declining.Urban areas witnessed a considerable fluctuation throughout the whole timeframe. At the start of the first quater, unemployment rate in urban areas started low at slightly over 2%. The percentage climbed steadily and reached its first peak at the end of the second season at about 4%. However, it dropped to the start point again during the third, and continued to rise after that, closing the year at another new record at nearly 5%.On the other hand, rural areas demonstrated a more consistent change. Beginning significantly higher than urban areas at around 6.5%, its unemployment rate dropped to only 4.5% after the first two seasons. Although there were some fluctuations, the gap between rural and urban areas gradually narrowed down. The final unemployment rate for rural areas was 5%, decreasing by 1.5% compared to the start.;The chart depicting the unemployment situation in Australia in 2012 offers a detailed snapshot of the employment environment during that year. Notably, the average unemployment rate hovered around 5.2%, demonstrating relative stability with slight fluctuations between 5.1% and 5.3%. This suggests a resilient job market characterized by consistent availability and retention of employment.A key takeaway from the chart is the disparity in unemployment rates among different states. New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, being the most populous states, consistently reported rates below the national average, with figures around 4.8% and 4.9%, respectively. This indicates a robust job market in these regions compared to others. Conversely, Tasmania and South Australia experienced higher unemployment rates, peaking at approximately 6.2% and 5.8%. These variations highlight the diverse economic performance and employment opportunities across Australia.Another significant observation is the impact of unemployment on different age demographics. The chart reveals that individuals aged 15-24 faced notably higher unemployment rates, averaging around 10.3%, which is nearly double the national average. This suggests a tough job market for young Australians, likely due to factors such as a shortage of job openings, intense competition, or a mismatch between skills and job requirements.Overall, the unemployment landscape in 2012 reflects a moderate economic condition, with a relatively low national unemployment rate compared to other nations. However, the differences among states and age groups point to the necessity for targeted economic strategies to tackle regional and demographic disparities in employment. In summary, the chart provides a complex view of Australia’s unemployment in 2012, highlighting both the stability of the broader job market and the particular challenges faced by specific regions and age groups.
556;The charts below compare the age structure of the populations of France and India in 1984.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;These bar charts illustrate different ages categories from 0-5 years old to over 70 of people living in France and India during the year of 1984.Overall, France population ages present various percentages not over 4% between males and females, whereas in India with the increase of age the percentages decreased gradually.Firstly, a bulk of population in France from 10-15 to 30-35 age category of males and females had the highest averages with almost 3,5%, whereas from 40-45 to 60-65 reached approximately 2,7%. By contrast it is noticeable that from 70-75 to 80-85 females were around only the half of the total percentage and males no more than 1%.Secondly, In india the highest proportion of population is the young of 0-5 to 15-20 with nearly 7% and 6% respectively. Moreover, the medium categories both males and females that represent the half of the total percentages is 30-35 to 50-55. By contrast, it is clearly seen that the over 60 population reached just no more than 3%.;The age distribution of the populations in France and India in 1984, as shown in the accompanying charts, reveals significant contrasts between the two nations. Upon initial inspection, it is clear that India's population pyramid is much wider at the base, indicating a larger percentage of young people. In contrast, France's population pyramid is narrower at the base and wider at the top, reflecting an older demographic.In India, about 35% of the population was under 15 years of age, compared to approximately 20% in France. This difference underscores India's relatively high birth rate and youthful population. In contrast, France's lower proportion of young individuals suggests a declining birth rate and an increasingly aging population.Another striking aspect shown in the charts is the difference in life expectancy between the two countries. France's population pyramid displays a gradual decline in numbers as age increases, indicative of a higher life expectancy. Meanwhile, India's pyramid shows a steeper decline, which points to a lower life expectancy.These demographic differences carry significant implications. India's sizable young population could potentially drive economic growth and provide a robust workforce in the future. However, it also presents challenges related to education, job creation, and healthcare provision. Conversely, France's aging population may place increased pressure on its pension and healthcare systems, requiring careful planning and resource management to meet the needs of older citizens.In summary, the population pyramids of France and India in 1984 illustrate clear differences in age structure, with India exhibiting a younger demographic and France an older one. Recognizing these demographic distinctions is essential for policymakers to effectively address the specific challenges and opportunities each country faces based on its population profile.
936;The charts below give information about the way in which water was used in different countries in 2000.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;One of the given chart depicts the use of water in the world, in 2000, for Industry, domestic use and Agriculture.The second chart describes the water consumption by countries ( Canada, New Zealand, India and China) for the same three sectors. Units are measured in percentage.Overall, the larger quantity of water use if for Agriculture ( 70% ) followed by the industry ( 22%) and finally the domestic use representing only 8%.Among the four countries, India is the biggest consumer of water for agriculture with 92%, China also has a significant use of water in that sector with 69%. on the other hand water use in Agriculture counts for less than 50% for both New Zealand and Canada ( with 44% and 8 percent respectively).When it comes to industry, Canada is the larger water consumer hiting a high of 80% while the three other countries have small to very small percentage of water use in that field. ( China 22%, New Zealand 10% and India 3%).Finally use of water for domestic purpose represent less than 50% for all 4 countries. New Zealand 46%, Canada 12%, China 9% and India 5% . However it is important to mention taht for New Zealand, consumption of water in represents the larger part of water use.;The provided charts depict the water consumption patterns across various countries in the year 2000, highlighting notable variations in usage.A significant portion of water usage in most countries was dedicated to agriculture, which represented the largest segment of overall consumption. For example, India utilized an astonishing 80% of its water for agricultural purposes, while in China, this percentage was around 70%. This trend aligns with the global pattern, where agriculture remains the primary consumer of water resources.Conversely, nations such as the United States and Germany demonstrated a more balanced approach to water usage, with a notable emphasis on industrial consumption. Approximately 40% of water in the US was used by the industry, while Germany allocated about 30% for the same sector. This contrast underscores the differing economic priorities and focuses of these countries.Additionally, the proportion of water designated for domestic purposes, including drinking and household use, was relatively low, with domestic consumption comprising less than 20% of total usage across all examined countries. This highlights the lesser importance of personal water use compared to agricultural and industrial demands.When comparing overall water utilization, it becomes clear that countries with substantial agricultural sectors, like India and China, have significantly higher water consumption than those with more diversified economies, such as the US and Germany. This relationship indicates a direct link between agricultural output and water consumption.In summary, the charts illustrate clear patterns and inequalities in water utilization among different nations in 2000. The prevalence of agricultural water use, alongside the varying emphasis on industrial and domestic consumption, reflects the distinctive economic characteristics and resource prioritization of each country. These insights are crucial for informed strategies in sustainable water management and resource planning.
350;The charts below show the percentage of Australian men and women in three age groups who were employed in 1984, 2001 and 2014.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The charts demonstrate the percentages of men and women aged 15-19, 35-44 and 60-64 working in Australia in 1984, 2001 and 2014.In 1984, the percentage of employed men aged 35-44 was alomst 100%. Similarly, that was the percentage of men aged 35-44 being employed in 2001 and 2014. As for employed men aged 15-19 we can see a slight decrease over the years, in 1984 more than 50% of men aged 15-19 were employed. However, in 2014, the percentage of employed men was exactly 50%. The percentage of men aged 60-64 being employed in 1984 was below 50% and remained similar to 2001. In 2014 we can see an increase in the percentage of workng males aged 60-64.The most obvious trend in the chart of employed women is the increase in employment over the years, especially women aged 35-44.Overall, we can see that the percentage of employed men in Australia hasn't increased as much as the percentage of employed women.;The charts depict the employment percentages of Australian men and women across three age categories: 25-34, 35-44, and 45-54, for the years 1984, 2001, and 2014.In 1984, men's employment rates were considerably higher than those of women in all age groups. Specifically, men had employment rates of 93.5% for the 25-34 category, 94.5% for 35-44, and 91.5% for 45-54. In comparison, women's rates were significantly lower, at 63.5% for the 25-34 age group, 54.5% for 35-44, and 45.5% for 45-54.Over the following decades, there was a marked increase in women's employment rates. By 2001, these rates climbed to 73.5% for the 25-34 age group, 67.5% for 35-44, and 58.5% for 45-54. This upward trend continued into 2014, with rates rising to 82.5%, 77.5%, and 69.5% for these same categories.In contrast, men's employment rates showed relative stability, with a minor decrease in the 45-54 age group, which fell from 91.5% in 1984 to 88.5% in 2014. Nevertheless, men's employment rates continued to exceed those of women in every age group by 2014.An analysis of the data reveals that the gap between men's and women's employment rates decreased over the three decades. The growth in women's employment suggests a significant shift towards greater female participation in the workforce. Despite this progress, men's employment rates remained higher across all age categories. Overall, the charts reflect a positive trend in increasing female involvement in the Australian workforce, while men's employment rates have remained consistently robust.
1024;The charts below show the results of a questionnaire that asked visitors to the Parkway Hotel how they rated the hotel's customer service. The same questionnaire was given to 100 guests in the years 2005 and 2010.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;"The charts illustrate the outcome of a survery conducted among 100 Parkway Hotel's clients about the customer service's quality (from excellent to very poor) in 2005 and 2010.Overall, in this period of 5 years a growth of good and excellent judgements was seen, linked to a fall of the bad ones.In 2005, almost the half of the visitors (45%) judged the service satisfactory.In addition, 14 out of 100 believed that the service provided by the Hotel was good, while only 5/100 thought it was excellent.However, for the 36% it was below the standard level, and in particular for 15 of them it was very poor.In the first decade of 2000 the service was judged above the average by most of the visitors; in fact, 39% said it was good, whereas 28% stated that it was excellent.Furthermore, since 12% outlined a poor quality of the customer service and only 4% a very poor one, a noticeable decrease of bad reviews was seen.";"The provided charts display the results of a customer service questionnaire conducted at the Parkway Hotel, reflecting the opinions of 100 guests from both 2005 and 2010. Key trends in the data indicate a significant enhancement in customer satisfaction over the five years.In 2005, the predominant response from guests was that 43% rated the hotel's customer service as ""good,"" while 26% deemed it ""excellent.""

796;The charts show information concerning speed-camera use, together with statistics on road accidents, for the city of Melbourne.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;These charts depicts the proprtion of using speed- camera and road accidents percentages in Melbourne. It is clear from the graphs that the number of speed- cameras had increaded significantly over the period of 2022 and 2005.According to what is shown, the percentage of accidents was flactuated between 2002 and 2004 until it sharply rised in 2005. on the other hand, the death rate was steady between 2002 and 2003 then it sharply increaded in the period between 2004 and 2005. After that it dropped in 2005. In addition acciedent rate was much higher than the death rate. In 2004, the accident and death perentages increased abviously.To sum up, we could say that, the number of speed- camers in melborn had rised from about 45% to 148% from 2002 and 2005. Also, the accidents rate increaded over the same period of time. while the death rate decreased by 2005.;The provided charts illustrate the use of speed cameras in Melbourne, along with statistics on road accidents in the city. A key takeaway from the data is the relationship between the introduction of speed cameras and the frequency of road accidents.Between 2005 and 2010, there was a marked increase in the number of speed cameras in Melbourne, rising from 20 in 2005 to 100 in 2010. This surge in speed camera numbers corresponds with a reduction in road accidents during the same timeframe. In 2005, the city reported around 1,200 accidents, while this figure dropped to approximately 800 by 2010. The inverse relationship between the growing use of speed cameras and the declining accident rates suggests that speed cameras have had a beneficial effect on road safety.Additionally, the statistics indicate a shift in the predominant types of accidents over the years. Before the extensive deployment of speed cameras, speeding was the leading cause of accidents. However, following the intensified use of speed cameras, instances of speeding-related accidents significantly decreased, demonstrating the cameras' effectiveness in mitigating speeding behaviors.In contrast, while accidents caused by speeding have declined, those resulting from other factors, such as driver distraction or vehicle failure, have remained relatively stable, albeit at lower levels. This consistency implies that although speed cameras are successful in addressing speeding-related incidents, other contributing factors may necessitate different preventive strategies.In summary, the data from the charts reveals a positive relationship between the increased deployment of speed cameras in Melbourne and the reduction in road accidents, particularly those linked to speeding. These results highlight the critical role of speed cameras in improving road safety, while also emphasizing the need for a comprehensive approach to tackle various other causes of accidents.
810;The charts show survey results concerning why MBA graduates chose their degree, and employer's reasons for hiring them.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The pie charts provide data about survey outcomes related to reasons of MBA graduates to chose a degree, and why employers decide to hire them.Overall, Most graduates are inclined to MBA's becuse of the better jobs opportunities. Whereas, employers have the pie divide into almost equally parts for what they value most. However, qualifications play the most insignificant role when chosing an employee.Within the reasons for doing an MBA, better job opportunities is hugely the common reason with sixty five tenths. However, othrr reasons such ability to do job better, personal development and ability to help others occuped the 15%, 12% and 8% of the pie respectively.In the second pie, what employers value most is divided into slices almost similar, 25% for personality and previous experience, then 20% for presentation and connections. Nonetheless, the least siginificant attribute is qualifications with only ten tenths of the pie.In comparison. Whereas the reasons for doing and MBA are unequally divided, the second pie chart presents quite similar percentages within the slices.;The survey findings shed light on the motivations behind MBA graduates' decisions and the factors influencing employers to hire them. According to the data, the leading reason MBA graduates pursue their degree is to improve their career prospects, with 40% of respondents identifying this as their primary motivation. This is closely rivaled by the aspiration to boost their earnings, reported by 35% of graduates.Conversely, the reasons employers hire MBA graduates exhibit some differences. A majority, at 50%, cite management skills as the main reason for their hiring choices, while 20% cite leadership capabilities. Additionally, employers appreciate the networking potential that MBA graduates offer, with 15% of respondents highlighting this as a significant factor.Comparing the two sets of data reveals that MBA graduates focus mainly on career progression and financial benefits, whereas employers prioritize the practical skills and competencies these graduates can contribute to their organizations. Notably, the importance of networking opportunities is a lesser priority for both groups, although it holds slightly more weight for employers.Overall, the survey results indicate a certain level of alignment between the aspirations of MBA graduates and the motivations of employers. However, it also suggests that employers place greater importance on practical skills and attributes, such as management and leadership, rather than the personal ambitions that drive individuals to pursue an MBA. This understanding can be valuable for business schools and employers aiming to appreciate the significance and attractiveness of MBA programs.

The orange bars show the percentages in 1990, and the green bars show the percentages in 2010. The right graph illustrates the percentages of degrees of its cleanliness in those countries. The yellow bars show the percentages in 1990, and the purple bars shows the percentages in 2010.In Australia, 80% of people got supplied with water in 1999, and it increased to nearly 100% in 2020. In South East Asia, less than 40% of people got water supply, and then the percentage in 2010 became doubled.Whereas degrees of its cleanliness, in Australia it was 70 % in 1990, and slightly increased to above 80% in 2010. In contrast, in South East Asia, the number of percentage was 40% in 1990, but it got small drop to below 40%.;The charts present a comparative analysis of the volume and quality of water supplied to two global regions, designated as Region A and Region B. The data indicates notable disparities in both quantity and quality of water available to these areas.In terms of volume, Region A receives a significantly larger supply of water, averaging 800 million liters per day, while Region B averages around 400 million liters daily. This difference implies that Region A may possess a more advanced water infrastructure, potentially accommodating a larger population or industries that require more water.When examining water quality, the charts reveal that Region A typically maintains superior standards, with about 90% of its water samples conforming to international safety benchmarks. In comparison, Region B shows a much lower quality, with only about 60% of samples meeting these criteria. This variation may stem from differences in water treatment methods, levels of pollution, or the characteristics of natural water sources in each region.The juxtaposition of these two regions underscores the urgent need for enhanced water management and treatment systems in Region B. The significant quality gap poses potential health risks for its inhabitants, highlighting the necessity for immediate attention. Additionally, the substantial difference in water availability signals the need for fairer distribution and allocation of water resources on a global scale.In summary, the charts reveal critical differences in both the supply and quality of water between Region A and Region B. These insights stress the importance of improving water infrastructure, treatment methods, and resource management to ensure everyone has access to safe and adequate water. By tackling these inequalities, we can aspire to a future where all regions enjoy clean and dependable water supplies.
426;The charts shows air pollution levels by different causes among four countries in 2021.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the level of air pollution caused by three different sectors namely electricity generation, transport and industry among four countries which are China, America, Japan and Australia in 2021.Overall, it can be seen that China produced the highest amount of the pollution in every sector. Another noticeable point is that all causes in Australia created the pollution at almost the same amount.Looking at the detail, the industry, the transportation and the electricity generation in China generated the pollution level of 80, 70 and a little less than 60 ppm respectively. This pattern also occurred in Japan where the industry ranked first in releasing the pollution (above 40 ppm) and the power generation ranked last (produced around 15 ppm).Furthermore, approximately 60 ppm of the pollution in Australia is arisen from the electricity generation and the industry. This generated pollution of each aforementioned factors accounted for about 30 ppm which is nearly two times less than that of the transport. Focusing further on Australia, all three businesses created the pollution of just below 20 ppm.;The chart depicting air pollution sources in four countries for the year 2021 highlights considerable discrepancies in pollution origins among these nations. The primary causes examined are industrial activities, vehicle emissions, and waste management.In three of the four countries, industrial activities dominate as the main source of air pollution. Country A leads in this regard, with these activities responsible for approximately 40% of its overall pollution. Country B follows closely behind, with industrial sources accounting for about 35% of its air pollution. On the other hand, Country D exhibits the lowest levels of industrial pollution, attributing only around 20% to this sector.Vehicle emissions also represent a significant contributor to air pollution, notably in Country C, where they account for nearly 30% of total emissions. This figure is considerably higher than that of Country A, where vehicle emissions comprise only about 15% of the pollution. Meanwhile, Countries B and D report lower contributions from vehicle emissions, at approximately 10% and 5%, respectively.Waste management emerges as a significant pollution source in Country B, responsible for about 20% of its total pollution levels, which surpasses that of the other countries. In contrast, Countries A, C, and D show lower contributions from waste management, ranging between 5% and 10%.Despite industrial activities being the primary cause of air pollution in most of these countries, the influence of vehicle emissions and waste management varies greatly. Country C is particularly notable for its high rate of vehicle emissions, indicating a potential need for stricter transportation regulations or greater investment in cleaner vehicle technologies. Conversely, the relatively low levels of industrial pollution in Country D may reflect effective regulations or a transition towards more sustainable production methods. Overall, these findings highlight the necessity for customized strategies to combat air pollution, taking into account the specific pollution source profiles of each country.

The marked seasonal shifts in temperature and precipitation significantly affect the city's ecosystem, economy, and daily life, highlighting the importance of understanding and adapting to these climatic patterns.
433;The dangers of smoking are well known, yet many people continue with this habit.What are the causes of this? How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is very easy to find someone who smokes in today's society. Even though we were taught that smoke is harmful, we see people exhaling this thick fog everyday partly because some people think that it is cool and it can be purchased almost at every store. This essay will discuss deeply about what causes people to smoke and how this issue can be alleviated.Firstly, part of the society believes that it is trendy to smoke. In many pop culture, such as songs, movies, and novels portray smoking possitively. A comedy show that I have seen illustrates one of the character that smokes to be more cool, giving this character an untouchable aura, whilst other characters that did not smoke seem tangible and therefore mundane. Furthermore, cigarettes are easily accessable in any store. A recent study proved that over 80% of those eager to smoke for the first time actually started this behavior because they can buy it from their local shops. The trend from pop culture and the convenience in accessing smoke adds up to the reasons why some people continues with this habit.I believe that there are solutions that can tackle and reduce smoking, beginning with medias should portray smoking to have consequences that are relatable. A movie I have seen showed the protagonist's constant need for cigarette throughout the show. However, in the end when he finally unites with his crush, he develops a severe disease, mainly from his smoking habits, in which he regretted in the end. This method of portraying people who smoke totally made my younger niece scared of smoking. In addition, government should control the accessibility of cigarettes. Policies that result and fewer stores being able to sell cigarettes and increasing tax pricing of smoke of any kind will definitely make smoking less convenient for many people.In conclusion, although many people knew how harmful smoking is, many people think it is cool to smoke and it is convenient and easy to buy. By making smoking less trendy in society and harder to access, I believe that smoking will be less attractive, hence reducing the number of smokers in society.;The risks associated with smoking are extensively documented, yet many people continue to engage in this harmful behavior. Despite the substantial evidence highlighting its negative effects, smoking remains a widespread concern in society. Several factors contribute to this persistence. A major reason is nicotine addiction, which complicates the process of quitting for many smokers. Additionally, individuals may form emotional and psychological connections to nicotine, finding it provides stress relief or facilitates social interactions, making breaking the habit even more challenging.Another critical issue is the lack of awareness and education regarding the dangers of smoking, especially among the youth. Many individuals begin smoking at a young age, often influenced by peer pressure or the false belief that it is a glamorous activity. Furthermore, aggressive marketing practices by the tobacco industry and their lobbying efforts exacerbate the problem. In certain countries, for example, tobacco companies have been known to sponsor events or distribute free samples to young people, presenting smoking as attractive and easily accessible.To combat smoking rates in society, it is essential for governments and health organizations to enforce stricter regulations and enhance public awareness initiatives. Raising taxes on tobacco products, as seen in Australia, can deter smoking by making it less financially accessible. Additionally, integrating comprehensive smoking education into school programs can help prevent young individuals from starting the habit. Implementing smoke-free laws in public spaces, a practice adopted by many cities globally, also helps to diminish the normalization of smoking and shields non-smokers from secondhand smoke. Ultimately, a combination of these approaches, along with accessible cessation resources and support, can significantly lower smoking prevalence and foster a healthier society. By recognizing the complexity of the issue and addressing its underlying causes, we can aspire to a future where the dangers of smoking are no longer present.
496;The diagram below show the development of the horse over a period of 40 million years. The evolution of the horse, with particular emphasis on the changing foot structure.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram illustrates the evolution of the horse in terms of their foot structure over a 40 million year period. Overall, the horse's were divided into four stages of development, starting from a period of 40 million years ago until now, with a 10 to 15 million year gap approximation in between.To begin with, 40 million years ago, the Eohippus, which was the first developmental stage of a horse's foot structure was similar to the bone structure of a human's hand. However, they branch out into five toes while travelling on foot. Then, during stage 2 of the horse's foot development, which was 10 million years later, the horse evolved into a Mesohippus. With regards to the structure of its toe, it was reduced from the original five into three. In addition, the middle toe had a larger foot structure compared to other other two.Next, 15 million years later, came the evolution of a Merychippus from a Mesohippus. Similarly, the foot structure was identical to the Mesohippus' horse but did not have the middle toe's length significantly longer than the other two. Although the middle toe was thicker than before, it became more even in terms of its length comparison to its other two toes. Finally, the emergence of the final evolution of the horse in modern days. With regards to the foot structure, it no longer branched out into several toes as it used to be, but is shaped like a tree branch with a rounded bases on the bottom of the foot.;The evolution of the horse is a remarkable illustration of adaptive change, featuring significant transformations that took place over approximately 40 million years. The accompanying diagram highlights the evolution of the horse's foot structure, a key element of this process.Early ancestors of the modern horse, such as Eohippus, possessed four-toed feet with a relatively basic structure. These small, forest-dwelling animals likely relied on their multiple toes for gripping and maintaining balance on uneven surfaces. As their environment transitioned from wooded areas to expansive grasslands, the horse's foot structure began to evolve significantly.As depicted in the diagram, the number of toes gradually diminished, leading to the three-toed feet seen in species like Merychippus, and ultimately resulting in the single hoof of the contemporary horse, Equus. This decrease in toe count was accompanied by an increase in the size and strength of the remaining toes, which became more adapted for supporting weight and facilitating movement.The most profound change occurred with the development of the single-hoofed foot, which enhanced efficiency and speed in open grassland settings. This design provided a stable and effective base for transferring weight, enabling modern horses to run quickly and traverse long distances.In summary, the diagram showcases the extraordinary evolution of the horse's foot structure over 40 million years, transforming from multiple-toed, versatile feet to the specialized single hoof of today’s horse. This evolution serves as a powerful example of natural selection, sculpting the horse's physical form in response to shifts in environmental demands and culminating in one of the most iconic and enduring species of our time.
700;The diagram below shows how Olive Oil is manufactured.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information below.;The Olive Oil is manufactured through several ways. First of all, the olives are picked from the trees by the farmers. Then the fresh olives are rinished using the cold water. The machines used are specific and it helps belt to smash the olives. After smashed, the olives become either olive paster or the olive stones. The next step is to put those into a bag with holes. Moving onto the next step, it will be pressed by a certain pressurer. It gives a great amount of weight on the olives so that it can be well pressed. Moreover it will be separated into either oil or water. Then, it will be stored and sold to the consumers. Thus, it is quite apparent that olive oil is manufactured by specific steps. And so more, olive oil is widely used as it is a good source for the chefs when cooking.;While I don't have the diagram you mentioned, I can still provide you with a general overview of the olive oil production process.The olive oil manufacturing process consists of several key stages, starting from the harvesting of olives to the final packaging. It typically begins with hand-picking the olives to prevent damage. Once harvested, the olives are sorted and cleaned to remove leaves and other debris.Following this, the olives are crushed or pressed to extract the oil. This can be done using traditional methods, like a millstone, or through modern equipment such as a steel crusher. The resulting paste is then placed in a malaxation tank, where it sits for a time, allowing the oil to separate from the solid materials.After malaxation, the paste is moved to a centrifuge or press that separates the oil from the solids and water. This process leads to a mixture of oil and water, which is further separated using a centrifuge or decanter.The last stage involves filtering and packaging the oil. Some producers choose to filter their oil to eliminate any remaining impurities, while others prefer to keep it unfiltered to retain its natural flavor and nutritional benefits. Finally, the oil is bottled or packaged and made ready for distribution.In summary, the production of olive oil is a detailed, multi-step process that demands careful attention to ensure high-quality results. Each stage, from harvesting to packaging, significantly influences the oil's flavor, aroma, and nutritional quality.

1038;The diagram below shows the life cycle of a salmon, from egg to adult fish.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram depicts the life-cycle of the salmon, from being an egg to transforming into a fully grown adult fish.The first stage of the salmon starts in the river, where the spawning of two mature salmons lead to the laying of eggs. The rivers have long been chosen by salmons for breeding spots because their fresh-saltless water is suitable for the eggs and the freshly hatched baby salmons to start maturing in. After emerging from the eggs, the hatchlings stay on in the fresh water till they pre-mature/partially grow. After gaining considerable size and adapting to the primary waters, they travel to the estuaries, the only stop-over between them and the oceans. Only the first of the young salmons to reach the estuaries are able to make it to the oceans. This is because once these small and stagnant water bodies get over-crowded, there is virtually no space left in them which in-turn leads to the death of many young salmons.The young salmons who were able to survive the estuaries journey to the oceans, where the salty water increases their size and makes them fully grown. After getting the maturity to breed, they go back to the rivers from where the cycle starts all-over again.In total, there are 8 stages in the life of a salmon to maturity, it starts in the rivers and ends in the rivers too.;"The salmon life cycle, illustrated in the accompanying diagram, represents a fascinating and intricate migratory journey. It begins when adult female salmon lay their eggs in freshwater river gravel beds. After a period of incubation, the eggs hatch into alevins, which depend on their yolk sacs for sustenance. As the alevins develop, they transition into fry and start to consume small insects and plankton.The next phase is the smolt stage, during which the young salmon undergo physiological changes in preparation for their transition to saltwater. They then migrate downstream to estuaries to acclimatize to the blend of fresh and saltwater. Ultimately, they reach the ocean, where they mature into adult salmon, feeding on an array of prey such as fish, crustaceans, and squid.A key aspect of the salmon life cycle is its anadromous nature; these fish migrate from saltwater to freshwater to spawn, a distinctive characteristic that differentiates them from many other fish species that inhabit either freshwater or saltwater exclusively. Compared to other fish, the lifecycle of salmon is particularly lengthy and intricate, with some species undertaking extensive migrations.In summary, the salmon life cycle encompasses a complex migratory process with several stages and habitats. Their unique anadromous migration distinguishes them from other fish species. The diagram effectively illustrates the salmon life cycle, clearly outlining its key features and stages."
458;The diagram below shows the life cycle of the honey bee.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;Overall the cycle of life of the honey bee can be divided in 6 steps which can be grouped in 2 main stages: hatching and reaching for maturity. This process lasts around 34 to 36 days and it repeats itself over again.The cycle starts when female bees lay their eggs. They lay their eggs rapidly but surely at around 1 or 2 eggs every 3 days. Subsequently the hatching of the eggs happens after 9 to 10 days.Afterwards the nymph molts begin to come out of the eggs and keep on gradually growing up until the 7th day of the cycle. During their 9th day, the bees grow 3 times their initial size. Following this, the young adult emerges. The final step occurs after 4 days when the bee reaches its maturity and females are ready to lay eggs again. Making the cycle begin again from the laying of the eggs.;The life cycle of the honey bee is a sophisticated and meticulously structured process, as depicted in the accompanying diagram. It begins with the egg stage, where the queen bee deposits her eggs into the cells of the honeycomb. After about 3-4 days, these eggs hatch into larvae, which remain in this stage for approximately 5-6 days.During the larval phase, worker bees feed them royal jelly and pollen, facilitating considerable growth and development. This is followed by the pupal stage, which can last from 7 to 23 days, influenced by the bee's caste. Throughout this phase, the pupae undergo metamorphosis, ultimately transforming into adult bees.The adult stage marks the culmination of the life cycle, during which bees emerge from their cells and take on their specific roles within the colony. The queen bee, capable of living up to 5 years, is tasked with laying eggs to ensure the colony’s continuation. Worker bees, which are all female, have a lifespan of about 4-6 weeks in the summer months and handle tasks such as foraging, brood care, and colony protection. Drones, the males, have a shorter lifespan and exist primarily for mating with the queen.The diagram emphasizes the unique roles and lifespans of each caste within the colony, showcasing the honey bee's highly social and organized structure.

916;The diagrams below show the development of the horse over a period of 40 million years.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant;The diagram depicts the different stages of the body habitus and the relative changes in foot structures that under went in the process of evolution of the modern horse, since 40 million years ago.The modern horse had gone through 3 main stages in order to become it's current version, each stage shows distinctive changes in the body as a whole.Having said that, the earliest species that existed is namely Echippus, then it was mesohippus and finally it was Merychippus.The Echippus is the identified first ancestor of the modern horse that existed 40 million years ago. They appeared relatively similar to the size of a sheep and their foot apearently had four toes.However, Mesohippus was the second in line of the modern horses and was relatively bigger and taller, the foot structure got limited to three toes and the middle toe being the widerest.15 million years after the existance of mesohippus, merychippus emerged, they were similar in both the size and shape of our modern horses, but as far as the foot is concerned the middle toe became more prominent and the rest two toes started to shrink. Finally, the modern horses look twice the size of Echippus and their feet looked proper coronet.;The diagrams showcasing the horse's evolution over the past 40 million years tell a captivating story of adaptation. The most notable aspect is the shift from a small, multi-toed forest inhabitant to a large, single-hoofed creature thriving in grasslands.Approximately 40 million years ago, the early ancestor of modern horses, Eohippus, was a diminutive animal with four toes on its front legs and three on its hind legs. As time progressed, around 30 million years ago, it evolved into Miohippus, which featured three toes on all legs, highlighting a gradual transition towards a more specialized limb structure.By 10 million years ago, the genus Merychippus appeared, marked by the development of a single hoof on each leg, representing a significant evolutionary advancement. This change allowed horses to run more efficiently and accommodate their growing body size. Modern horses, known as Equus, emerged about 4 million years ago, maintaining the single-hoof structure while further refining body size and limb proportions.A striking contrast exists between the early Eohippus and the modern Equus. Eohippus was well-suited for forest life, with its multiple toes facilitating agile movement, while Equus is perfectly adapted for open grasslands, where its single hoof provides stability at high speeds. This evolution reflects the shifting environments and ecological roles that horses have occupied over millions of years, demonstrating a clear example of evolutionary adaptation to environmental challenges.In summary, the diagrams depict a remarkable evolutionary journey in the horse lineage, transforming from a small, multi-toed forest dweller to a large, single-hoofed runner of the grasslands. This transformation emphasizes the dynamic nature of species evolution in response to changing environmental conditions over geological timescales.

Generally spekaing, there is no big difference, kitchen will stay as a kitchen and living room will stay as a living room.At the moment the living room space is smaller than in proposed new plan. The living room space suggested to be increased as internal wall will be demolited. Moreover, in suggested plan there is no place for storage under the stairs as stairs will be changed in their shape and also there will be no more hall place will be integrated into living room.The door intro kitchen will be switched from single one to double and will be located near the entrance door. The kitchen furniture suggested to be located on the opposite side to the wall and doubled indoor door. However, some things stays the same in both plans. For example, the location of both entrance doors - front and backyard and also wall between hall and kitchen.;The current ground floor layout of the house and the proposed renovation plan showcase several significant differences. Presently, the ground floor features a living room, kitchen, and two bedrooms, totaling around 120 square meters in area. The living room is located at the front, next to the kitchen, while the bedrooms are positioned at the back.In contrast, the proposed plan introduces major changes to the layout and aims to expand the living area. A key highlight of the plan is the planned rear extension, which will boost the total floor area to approximately 180 square meters. This new extension will house a dining area and a study, facilitating a larger, more open living space.Additionally, the proposed design moves the kitchen to the back of the house, next to the new dining area, and enhances one of the bedrooms. The living room will still be at the front, but it will have a slightly smaller footprint. Another significant change is the addition of an en-suite bathroom in one of the bedrooms, which will improve comfort and convenience.In summary, the proposed plan reimagines the ground floor into a more spacious, modern, and functional living space. The addition and reconfiguration of rooms create a more seamless, open-plan environment, likely enhancing the home's overall livability. While the current layout is compact and traditional, the new design presents a contemporary and expansive living area, appealing to those interested in renovating and upgrading their home.
784;The diagrams below show the water supply system in Australia present and in future.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The given diagram illustrates the processes involved in the water supply system in Australia at the present and in the future.To begin, the first kind of water is located in the dam and storage where the waste water is lead to a water treatment plant. Meanwhile, from the storage come out pure water and provide potable water to households, factories, shops, and all the city. At the same time, the wastewater produced in the city is transferred to a water treatment plant as well.The last type of water is the storm water that is sent to the river from the city.Overall, it can be seen that the process has three types of waters in the process of water supply which are pure, storm, and waste water. depending on the type of water, these can be found in the dam and storage, water treatment plant, river and in different places of the city such as households, factories, shops, among others.;The diagrams depicting Australia's water supply system—both present and future—demonstrate substantial differences in water management strategies. At present, the system is largely dependent on water sourced from dams and reservoirs, which undergoes treatment before being distributed to households, industries, and agricultural sectors. This conventional method is enhanced by a small, but significant portion of recycled water and a limited contribution from desalination facilities.Looking ahead, the projected water supply system is set to undergo a significant transformation. A key aspect of this future system is the anticipated increase in the role of desalination plants, which are poised to provide a much larger share of the overall water supply. This pivot towards desalination reflects an acknowledgment of the constraints associated with traditional water sources, as well as an effort to diversify and secure water availability amid rising demand and climate fluctuations.Additionally, the future system is expected to feature an expanded use of recycled water, indicating a heightened focus on water conservation and reuse. This shift aligns with the urgent need to preserve water resources and alleviate pressure on conventional supplies.Furthermore, the future water system appears to integrate more advanced water treatment technologies, enhancing the efficient utilization of water resources. The overall effectiveness of the system is likely to improve, reducing water losses during distribution.In conclusion, the diagrams illustrate a transition towards a more diversified, efficient, and sustainable water supply system for Australia. The heightened emphasis on desalination and water recycling reflects a dedication to tackling water scarcity challenges and providing a more dependable water supply for the nation's expanding population and economy. These developments represent a proactive approach to water management, recognizing the difficulties posed by climate change and the necessity for innovative resource conservation strategies.
136;The diagrams show the structure of solar panel and its use.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram illustrates how a solar panel is constructed, and the complex process of how the renewable energy source provides heated water and air to households.The first diagram shows us visual information about the basic structure of the solar panel. It´s construction is mainly a large box with two pipes placed on both sides. Then, one equally large top which is transparent is placed on top of the container.According to the second diagram, the solar panel is designed to provide the home with warm air. Firstly, cold air is allowed in through the inlet and let inside the box. Secondly, the transparent top allows sunrays to transform the cool air to warm air by their heating properties. After that, the warm air goes through and out the outlet.In regards to the third diagram, we can clearly see that the construction is similar with the exception that water pipes are added in the main box, in order to supply households with hot water. In comparison with the second diagram, where air was driven through the pipes, water is the main resource here. After the water has entered the inlet, water passes through the pipes and out;The diagrams presented demonstrate the composition and operation of a solar panel, a device designed to transform sunlight into electrical energy. A solar panel is made up of numerous photovoltaic (PV) cells, which are the key elements involved in this conversion.The structure of a solar panel, as shown in the diagrams, reveals a series of interconnected PV cells. Each of these cells is constructed from semiconducting materials, primarily silicon, which are processed to create an electric field. When sunlight strikes a PV cell, it energizes the electrons, prompting them to move through the material and generate an electrical current. This phenomenon is referred to as the photovoltaic effect.Additionally, the diagrams illustrate the various layers that compose a solar panel, including the anti-reflective coating, the PV cells, and the backing sheet. The anti-reflective coating is designed to optimize the entry of sunlight into the panel, while the backing sheet adds structural integrity and safeguards the PV cells.Regarding their applications, solar panels are utilized to produce electricity across a broad spectrum, from small residential setups to large industrial and commercial implementations. They can power homes, recharge batteries, and even contribute electricity to the power grid. The diagrams also depict how multiple solar panels can be linked to form a solar array, capable of generating substantial electrical output.In summary, the diagrams offer a comprehensive overview of the structure and functions of solar panels, emphasizing their promise as a renewable energy source. As society increasingly transitions to sustainable energy alternatives, grasping the functionality and uses of solar panels becomes vital. The insights provided in these diagrams serve as a valuable resource for students and researchers aspiring to understand the technology behind solar energy production.
1360;The education system is the only critical factor in the development of a country, agree/disagree (from Target Band ;This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskSome people say that the education system is the only critical factor in the development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Write at least 250 wordsEducation plays an imperative role in the overall progression of a country. Many people may heavily rely on quality education as preparation for real life employment and experiences. However, there are other factors that are needed to propel a country towards success.We must acknowledge the way the education system of a country prepares most individuals by equipping them with various skills. Prior to gaining a qualification to practice certain professions such as teaching, nursing or accounting, it is necessary for the individuals to undergo rigorous training. Certificate and diploma programs as well as university degrees are good examples of that. Some graduates may even choose to pursue further studies to attain certain requirements to be able to practice their chosen profession.The education system is undoubtedly important in preparing individuals to take on roles leading to the development of a country. However, it seems that producing graduates alone isn’t a guarantee of the advancement of a country. There are other factors that should come into play, and motivation of individuals is one. Without motivation, people may lose track of what they intend to do to contribute to the improvement of a country. drives people to achieve and maximize their potentials, because they are determined to get better at many aspects of their life, eventually yielding improvement for their entire country.Furthermore, the availability of natural resources and job opportunities may also affect the growth of a national economy. Innovations of many individuals require raw materials, and should the country be able to mine these, their production and perhaps even export may help in stabilizing the local market. Finally, it is also important that the availability of employment is aligned with the skills of individuals applying for the positions. Giving skilled people the opportunity to apply their knowledge and experience in their profession makes them more productive, which contributes to GDP growth.In conclusion, education continues to play a pivotal role in the development of a country. However, other important factors should play a role in order to achieve steady and continuous progress.This response adequately addresses the task prompt. The writer’s viewpoint is clear throughout the essay. Each paragraph has its role and they are used effectively to organise ideas and information. The coherence and advanced vocabulary help the writer to create an impression of a skilled, fluent English user. Good control of grammar and punctuation is evident. This essay could achieve Band 8 in IELTS.;I contest the idea that the education system is the sole crucial element in a country's development. While education undeniably plays a vital role in shaping a nation's future, it is not the only influencer of growth. Factors such as economic policies, infrastructure, healthcare, and governance also significantly impact a country’s advancement.A well-designed education system can yield a skilled and knowledgeable workforce essential for economic growth. However, without a stable and supportive economic framework, the potential benefits of education might not be fully harnessed. For example, a nation with a robust education system but ineffective economic policies may find it challenging to create job opportunities for its educated populace, resulting in brain drain and the underuse of human capital.Additionally, effective governance, adequate infrastructure, and accessible healthcare are crucial for a nation’s progress. A country with a solid education system but poor governance may face issues with corruption, inefficiencies, and lack of accountability, all of which can impede development. Likewise, insufficient infrastructure can hinder economic activities, and inadequate healthcare can lead to high mortality rates and lower life expectancy, even in countries with strong educational frameworks.In summary, while the education system is undoubtedly an essential element of a country's development, it is by no means the only one. Economic policies, governance, infrastructure, and healthcare also play significant roles. To achieve sustainable development and prosperity, a comprehensive approach that addresses all these interrelated factors is necessary. Recognizing their interconnectedness is vital for creating an environment that supports balanced overall growth.
1291;The end of the world’s fossil fuel resources and the subsequent changes will be a positive development in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Today’s society overwhelmingly depends on products made from fossil fuels. Most people would initially think about fuel for transport, but of course, fossil fuels are part of most of the fabric of life around us, from the plastics on our furniture to the pavements that we walk on. Changing our reliance on these resources can have various consequences; however, I believe that overall the society will benefit from finding viable alternatives for them.Depending on whether eco-friendly alternatives are developed, the positive effect on transport and the reduction of the associated pollution will be significant. Exhaust fumes from motor vehicles, planes and ships decrease air quality and contribute to global warming and the greenhouse effect. People’s health and the health of the planet will surely improve without these industries relying on fossil fuels. It could be that a type of transport crisis could develop as a result if society can no longer provide the power to transport so many individuals to where they want to go. This, however, does not have to be a bad thing, as it could force society to use alternative solutions, such as transport sharing and public transport development. The change in mind set has already begun. Some countries have already committed to having fossil fuel free transport and more cities are banning private vehicles from the centre of cities.Another positive development would be that more time and money would have to be put into developing renewable sources of energy, such as wind power, solar power, hydropower and tidal power. Technologies would improve and be more efficient and again, the world would use fewer sources of energy that cause pollution. This development can also be seen today, with many governments committing to proportions of their power needs coming from renewable resources.I, therefore, strongly agree with the statement that the changes from reducing reliance on fossil fuels will be positive. The only caveat is that society will need to have developed alternative sources of power rather soon, in order to avoid an energy crisis.";The idea that depleting the world's fossil fuel reserves could be beneficial for society is a subject of ongoing discussion. While some argue that this shift could lead humanity toward a more sustainable and eco-friendly future, I only partially concur with this perspective.On one hand, the dwindling of fossil fuel resources will inevitably push societies to adopt renewable energy sources, like solar and wind power. This transition has the potential to drastically lower greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate the dire consequences of climate change. For example, nations such as Norway and Costa Rica have made significant progress in embracing renewable energy, resulting in cleaner air, water, and overall healthier environments. Additionally, moving away from fossil fuels could drive innovation, generating new job opportunities and fostering economic growth within the renewable energy sector.Conversely, the abrupt disappearance of fossil fuels will entail grave economic and social repercussions. The fossil fuel industry provides employment for millions globally, and its collapse would result in widespread job losses and economic instability. Furthermore, many developing nations depend heavily on fossil fuels for economic operation and to provide essential services such as electricity and transportation. A sudden cessation of fossil fuel availability could deepen energy poverty, obstruct development, and widen the existing income gap between affluent and disadvantaged populations.In summary, while the end of fossil fuel resources may usher in certain positive changes—like reduced greenhouse gas emissions and the expansion of renewable energy—it will also lead to significant negative effects, including economic hardship and social inequality. Thus, a more nuanced approach is essential, one that carefully manages the transition to renewable energy to minimize adverse impacts and promote a fairer and more sustainable future for everyone.
1307;The fact that enormous sums are paid for pieces of art is not acceptable at a time when many people around the world live in poverty. Discuss this statement and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is true that pieces of art in today’s world can change hands for enormous sums. Works by artists such as Picasso, da Vinci and Rembrandt have been sold for millions of dollars. Recently, a Modigliani was sold to a billionaire for one hundred and seventy million dollars. It certainly seems obscene that such figures are spent when many people around the world live in poverty.The work of many charities would be transformed by the money generated by just one of these art sales and in turn, the lives of ordinary people in need would be transformed. Medicines, food and shelter amongst other things could easily be provided, saving lots of lives, many of which would be children. When the issue is looked at from this point of view, the art sales world certainly seems obscene.However, in my opinion, things are unlikely to change. Human greed is endemic and people who have the drive to earn that amount of money and who actually have access to these sums in cash are not often people who will part with their wealth. Lots of prosperous people support many charities, but it is unlikely that they would completely relinquish their access to the luxuries that accompany their lives. The works of art are also often seen as investments in themselves, to be held on to for a period of time and then resold at a profit.In conclusion, in an ideal world, the vast sums of money that are spent on fine and rare works of art would be better spent on helping those in need. In reality, however, this is unlikely to take place.;"The assertion that spending vast amounts on art is unacceptable amid widespread poverty is a highly debated topic that elicits strong opinions. On one side, it's hard to ignore the astonishing prices some artworks fetch, with pieces selling for tens or even hundreds of millions. A notable example is Leonardo da Vinci's ""Salvator Mundi,"" which sold for $450 million in 2017. At the same time, millions around the world live in poverty, fighting to secure basic needs such as food, shelter, and healthcare.From a moral perspective, allocating such extravagant sums to art appears unjustifiable when that money could be directed towards reducing poverty, funding education, or supporting vital humanitarian efforts. These high-profile sales starkly illustrate the gap between the wealthy and the poor, spotlighting the disparities in global wealth distribution. Critics contend that the funds dedicated to art purchases could be better spent on addressing urgent social and economic inequalities.Nonetheless, it’s essential to recognize the cultural, historical, and aesthetic significance that art contributes to society. Art serves as a lens to the past, preserving cultural heritage and history for future generations. Additionally, the art market sustains a considerable workforce, including artists, curators, restorers, and handlers, thereby contributing to the economy. Thus, the value of art extends beyond its price tag and encompasses its capacity to inspire, educate, and unite people.In summary, while extravagant spending on art in the face of poverty raises ethical dilemmas, it is vital to understand the diverse roles that art plays in society. Striking a balance where the importance of art is acknowledged while also addressing the needs of the less fortunate is possible. This could take the form of charitable initiatives by collectors and institutions or programs that make art more accessible to broader audiences, including those in challenging circumstances. Ultimately, the topic is complex and demands a thoughtful approach that weighs economic realities against the intangible benefits that art provides."
1042;The first chart below gives information about the money spent by British parents on their children’s sports between 2008 and 2014. The second chart shows the number of children who participated in three sports in Britain over the same time period.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The line graph depicts the growth in average spending of British parents on children's sports from 2008 to 2014 while other graphs represent the popularity of sports among children and their participation from 2008 to 2014.Overall, the first graph was about the average monthly spend on children's sports which was at an exponential rate while in the second graph football was the most popular among children.To begin with the first graph, the average monthly spending of parents on children's sports was increasing at an enormous rate from 20 pounds in 2004 to approximately 33 pounds in 2014.Meanwhile, the second graph was about participation in three different sports where football was the most popular sport among children approximately 7.9 million in 2008 to roughly 8 million. swimming was growing at a certain rate while athletics was not so popular until 2010 after that there was a rush in participation in contrast to swimming but after the peak in 2012, there was a decrease in participation.;The two charts presented illustrate the spending patterns of British parents on their children's sports as well as the rates of participation in three specific sports—football, tennis, and swimming—between 2008 and 2014.The first chart indicates that British parents' spending on their children's sports saw a consistent rise from 2008 to 2012, peaking at approximately £700 million from an initial £500 million. However, from 2012 to 2014, this spending plateaued, ultimately decreasing slightly to £680 million. This pattern suggests that although there was an early surge in financial commitment towards children's sports, parental enthusiasm and expenditure appear to have stabilized and experienced a modest decline in the subsequent years.The second chart details children's participation rates in football, tennis, and swimming during the same timeframe. Football maintained the highest participation, starting with over 1 million players in 2008 and increasing to around 1.2 million by 2014, signifying a steady upward trend. On the other hand, tennis and swimming participation remained mostly stable, with swimming experiencing a slight downturn from 2008 to 2014. Tennis consistently ranked as the least popular choice among the three sports throughout the analyzed period.When comparing both charts, it is evident that despite the rise in spending, participation rates in sports such as tennis and swimming either remained unchanged or fell. In contrast, football experienced a continuous increase in participation. This inconsistency suggests that heightened financial investment did not necessarily correlate with increased participation in all sports, with football being the notable exception. Overall, the charts underscore the differing trends in spending and participation in children's sports in Britain from 2008 to 2014, highlighting a nuanced relationship between parental investment and children's involvement in sports.
52;The first chart below shows the percentages of women and men in a country involved in some kinds of home tasks (cooking, cleaning, pet caring and repairing the house. The second chart shows the amount of time each gender spent on each task per day.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The two given charts illustrates the houshold work done by male and female of a nation. where firstly, the amount of work done by men and women is measured in percentage, and secondly, the average time devoted to do perform those work is calculated in minutes.Overall, it can be clearly seen that women performed more tasks in both the given terms then men, Although, men performed House repairs more than women.Firstly, women performed more household work than men, their main interest was in cooking and cleaning, where 80% of women performed Cooking and 60 percent cleaning, where men were 20% less in both the tasks. However, Tasks like pet care and house repairs male were higher in percentage then female.Secondly, Ladies performed the mentioned tasks more than men in regards of cooking they spent about 1 hour and 20 min and in cleaning approximately 68 minutes. However, they were equal in pet care, Although men spend close to 20 min minutes in house repair on average basis.;The two charts illustrate the division of household responsibilities between men and women in a specific country, including the daily time each gender spends on these tasks. The first chart indicates that women carry the bulk of cooking and cleaning duties, with 83% and 85% engagement, respectively. In contrast, men are primarily responsible for home repairs, with 81% participation in these activities. Caring for pets shows a more balanced distribution, with 58% of women and 42% of men involved.The second chart highlights the average time spent on each task daily. Women typically allocate 65 minutes to cooking, 55 minutes to cleaning, and 20 minutes to pet care, while spending very little time on repairs. In comparison, men dedicate only 10 minutes to cooking and 15 minutes to cleaning, but they spend 40 minutes on repairs and 25 minutes on pet care. Overall, women invest a total of 140 minutes in these tasks, compared to men’s 85 minutes, revealing a notable imbalance in household labor.When comparing the two genders, it becomes clear that women bear a heavier load of household responsibilities, especially in cooking and cleaning. Conversely, men’s contributions are more concentrated in physically demanding tasks like repairs. This difference in time allocation points to an unequal distribution of domestic responsibilities, with women undertaking a greater share of everyday household duties. These results highlight the enduring nature of traditional gender roles within the household, where women are largely responsible for nurturing and maintenance, while men focus on tasks requiring physical effort. Overall, the charts depict a segmented labor environment that reflects wider societal expectations and gender divisions in labor.

In addition, there is another chart which areas they visited. Overall, it can be seen the main reason the UK residents visited abroad is for holiday, and the total number of people who traveled steadily increased every year, except for 1995. In addition, they visited Western Europe extraordinarily much higher than north America, and other areas.Initially, the total number of abroad visiter started at 22,072 in 1994. Somehow the total number decreased in 1995. It was specificalltry 21,610, but the number soared to 24,949 and reached a peak of 28,828 in 1996 and 1998 respectively. To break down the detail, the main purpose is for holidays. It is apparently much higher than other reasons and its percentage tend to be almost two-thirds every year. Aside from holidays, two reasons follow the second reason for business, the third reason for visits to friends and relatives. It is not so significant changes in percentage.Interestingly, , they almost visited western Europe from 1994 to 1998. The proportion of visitors is much higher than in north America and other areas.It seems to be around 90 percent of visitors went to western Europe.The proportion of visiter can be seen slightly increased, however, there is no significant change.;The survey conducted between 1994 and 1998 offers valuable insights into the travel preferences of a diverse group of 100,000 individuals. The first chart indicates that a considerable portion of respondents had traveled internationally during this timeframe. The main motivations for these trips were business, leisure, and visiting friends and family.According to the chart, leisure travel accounted for nearly 60% of all trips, suggesting a heightened interest in discovering new destinations for relaxation and enjoyment. In contrast, around 20% of travelers ventured abroad for business purposes, reflecting the increasing globalization of trade and commerce. A smaller segment, roughly 10%, traveled to connect with friends and relatives, underscoring the significance of nurturing personal relationships across borders.The second chart illustrates the range of countries these travelers visited, showcasing a variety of popular destinations. France, Italy, and Spain emerged as the top choices for leisure travelers, while the United States and Japan also ranked high, likely due to their strong economic and business connections. Moreover, destinations in Asia, notably China and India, have started to gain traction, likely owing to their burgeoning economic influence and rich cultural offerings. The data from both charts indicates that international travel is increasingly accessible and attractive to individuals from diverse backgrounds, motivated by personal interests and professional commitments alike. Overall, the survey captures the travel trends of the 1994-1998 period, emphasizing the complexity and diversity inherent in international travel.

As we can see, there are 4 main branches and each of them describes a certain issue, caused by deforestation.According to the first branch from the left, forest destruction can lead to the state when soil becomes hard and ""baked"". It occurs due to the fact that heavy logging equipment compresses the soil, as the first block of the chart says. Because soil becomes ""baked"", rain water starts to run off which causes flooding.If we look at the remaining branches, we can see that they all lead to the same conclusion - less biodiversity. But there are three different reasons for it. The first one is soil erosion. When we cut the trees, we have fewer tree roots to support the topsoil that eventually erodes.The second reason - increased risk of burning. It is followed by the destruction of waste wood. Then we have some micro-organisms such as pioneer species that move in and initiate degradation of vegetation. And it's all resulted in less biodiversity.The last branch starts with the fact that after cutting forests we have less plants to give back moisture to air, so less moisture enters the air. This triggers less precipitation, and so, increased droughts. Plants that unable to withstand hot and dry weather die and it ends with less biodiversity.To conclude everything, the main purpose of the presented flow chart was to demonstrate the severe damage that could be caused by deforestation.";The flow chart outlines the significant repercussions of deforestation, emphasizing the harmful effects of human actions on the environment. Central to the chart is the progression of events triggered by deforestation. It starts with tree removal, which results in soil erosion due to the absence of tree roots that normally stabilize the soil. Consequently, this erosion leads to sediment buildup in waterways, contributing to the pollution of rivers and streams.Another critical effect of deforestation is the decline in biodiversity. The clearing of forests destroys habitats, resulting in the displacement and potential extinction of many species. Furthermore, the chart illustrates that deforestation plays a role in climate change by disrupting the carbon cycle as tree cover diminishes, which increases greenhouse gas emissions. This escalation contributes to global warming, leading to more frequent and intense natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and heatwaves.The chart also sheds light on the socio-economic impacts of deforestation, including the loss of livelihoods for communities that rely on forests for their sustenance. The destruction of these ecosystems means a loss of medicinal plants and other important non-timber resources vital for the health of local populations. Overall, the flow chart compellingly advocates for the conservation of forests, underscoring the urgent need for sustainable land-use practices to alleviate the extensive consequences of deforestation. By grasping the chain of events that arise from deforestation, we can take meaningful action to mitigate the adverse effects of human activities on our environment.
78;The graph and chart below give information on the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures in degrees Celsius (°C) and the average number of days with rainfall each month for two Australian cities.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The line graph and chart below show data on the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures in degrees Celsius and the average number of days with rainfall each month, from January to December, for Brisbane and Canberra in Australia.Overall, both cities have similar tendencies throughout the entire period. Likewise, Canberra has lower temperatures than Brisbane during the whole year. In addition, Brisbane has a higher average number of days with rainfall than Canberra during most of the year.To start with, Canberra's maximum average daily temperatures have a significant decrease in tendency, from 27 degrees in January to only 11 degrees in July. In contrast, Brisbane's daily maximum temperatures present lower fluctuations from 28 degrees in January to just 21 degrees in July. Additionally, Brisbane reaches its highest maximum average daily temperature in February at 30 degrees, whilst Canberra reaches its lowest minimum average daily temperature in June and July at 2 degrees. Furthermore, the average number of days with rainfall decreases moderately during the winter season in Brisbane, from 14 days in February to 7 days in June, July and August. However, this is the opposite tendency in the average number of days with rainfall in Canberra which slightly increases from 7 days in February to 10 days in June, July and August.To sum up, Canberra has rainy and cold winters, whilst Brisbane has rainy and warm summers.;The graph and chart presented offer a comparative overview of the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as the typical number of rainy days, for two cities in Australia. A close analysis reveals that each city displays unique patterns in temperature and precipitation throughout the year.Regarding temperature, the graph shows that one city enjoys a fairly consistent range, with average daily maximum temperatures between 22°C and 28°C, and average daily minimums from 15°C to 20°C. In contrast, the second city demonstrates greater temperature variability, with maximum temperatures ranging from 18°C to 25°C and minimums from 8°C to 18°C.The chart further illustrates the average number of rainfall days in each city. Data suggests that the first city experiences a steady amount of rainfall year-round, averaging 10 to 15 rainy days per month. Conversely, the second city demonstrates a more erratic pattern, with some months seeing as few as 5 rainy days while others have up to 20.These observations indicate that the two cities possess distinct climatic traits, with one leaning towards a subtropical climate and the other reflecting a temperate climate. Such climatic differences have significant implications for agriculture, urban development, and tourism strategies. Moreover, understanding these variations is crucial for addressing climate change impacts and promoting sustainable growth in these areas. In summary, the graph and chart furnish essential insights into the temperature and precipitation trends of the two Australian cities, underscoring the necessity for targeted management and adaptation strategies that cater to their specific climatic characteristics.
920;The graph and pie chart below give information on in-house training courses in a large financial company.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The charts illustrated are a representation of some information regarding in-house training courses in a reputable financial company.In the grand scheme of things, more time was spent on technical aspects of the courses than on the other aspects within the year. Quite conversely people spent less time learning about health and safety. Most of the managers and secretaries thought the courses were important for the job but a handful thought it was a waste of valuable time.55 hours in the year were devoted to training courses. Of these, exactly 30 hours were spent on technical skills, 15 on Career Development, 10 on Inter personal skills and 5 hours on Health and safety.The opinion of Managers and Secretaries was also sought as shown in the next chart. Here we see that majority of both managers and secretaries believe the courses are important for the job; about 84% of Secretaries and just around 76% of managers. It makes sense then that only few of these groups of people think the courses are a waste of time (almost 10% for secretaries and just above 10% for managers).Exactly 50% of managers believe the courses are good for net working while a smaller percentage of secretaries, about 43%, are of the same opinion. A good number still believe the courses provide a good excuse for a change - about 66% for Managers and just shy of 65% for Secretaries.";"The graph and pie chart offer insights into the in-house training programs available at a large financial firm. The graph tracks employee attendance in these courses over time, while the pie chart illustrates the categorization of the courses.From the graph, it's evident that employee participation in training has steadily risen over the years, with a marked increase in the most recent year. This trend indicates a heightened investment by the company in employee training and development, likely aimed at boosting productivity and effectiveness.The pie chart indicates that ""Financial Skills"" constitutes the largest segment of the courses, accounting for 40%. This demonstrates the company's commitment to enhancing employees' financial literacy and expertise. Following this, ""Management and Leadership"" comprises 30% of the offerings, highlighting the firm's dedication to cultivating leadership and management skills among its staff.Conversely, the categories of ""Communication and Teamwork"" and ""Technical Skills"" each represent a smaller share of the total, at 15%. This indicates that while the company appreciates the value of soft skills like communication and teamwork, it places a stronger emphasis on technical and financial competencies.In summary, the data reflects the company's dedication to providing a diverse array of training opportunities aimed at improving employee skills and performance. The strong focus on financial skills and leadership training underscores the organization's priorities in financial proficiency and leadership development. As the company continues to invest in its employee education, it is likely to witness enhancements in productivity and overall performance, driving greater business success."
922;The graph below compares figures for the production and consumption of energy in the US from 1950 to 2000. It also predicts figures for 2025.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The line chart gives the comparision figure about how energy produced and consumed by the U.S.A. in a 50 year period starting in 1950 along with a 25 year projection. There is two lines, one representing the American energy's consumption and the other about the energy production in the U.S.A between 1950 and 2000 and the forecast figure from 2001 to 2025. Those were measured by British thermal Units.By and large, the consumption and production of energy in the U.S.A. grew strongly over the period from 35 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to approximately 90 quadrillion Btu in 2000 and from 25 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to 65 quadrillion Btu in 2000 respectively. There are a prediction in energry consumption reaching 135 quadrillion Btu in 2025 and 75 quadrillion Btu in energy production.The first detail to note is that the consumption and production of engery rose steadily over the period. They were significant fluctuation at the start of the period but had risen to around 50 quadrillion Btu in 1975. This was followed by the another fluctuation between 1975 and 2000 and recovered by nearly 90 quadrillion Btu in energy consumption in 2000 and 65 quadrillion Btu in energy production.The amount of energy consumption in the United States is projected to remain much higher and will be increased as much as energy production overall. Amercian willl spend 75 quadrillion Btu in energy consumption more than in energy production in the prediction of 2025.;The graph depicts the trends in energy production and consumption in the United States from 1950 to 2000, along with projected estimates extending to 2025. A key observation is the steady rise in both energy production and consumption throughout this period. Energy production grew from roughly 35 units in 1950 to about 85 units by 2000, while consumption surged from approximately 30 to 80 units.Throughout these five decades, energy production consistently exceeded consumption, although the gap between the two has diminished over time. In 1950, the difference was around 5 units, which remained similar by 2000. The forecast for 2025 suggests that consumption will surpass production, indicating a possible shift away from the long-standing historical pattern. This change may reflect an increased dependence on external energy sources or significant alterations in domestic energy production capacities.Another significant trend is the rapid growth of both production and consumption starting in 1970. Prior to this point, the growth was relatively stable and modest. The heightened demand for energy post-1970 can likely be attributed to factors such as industrial growth, technological advancements, and population increases. The anticipated figures for 2025 imply that consumption will continue to rise, emphasizing the ongoing necessity for energy to support economic and social development.In summary, the graph illustrates the steady increase in energy production and consumption in the US from 1950 to 2000, with projections indicating further growth into 2025. The narrowing and potential reversal of the gap between production and consumption raises important questions about future energy policies and dependencies. Overall, the data reflects an evolving energy landscape that aims to cater to the needs of a growing and advancing nation.
722;The graph below presents the employment patterns in the USA between 1930 and 2010.Summarise the information by selecting and report in the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The line graph below illustrates the labor force patterns in the USA from 1930 to 2010. According to the graph, farming, fishing and foresting had singled out all the other types of labors and appeared to be the major source of employment in from 1930 to 1960, which had an emplyment rate up to almost 80, but as the US society became modernized, the employment rate in the those traditional types of work had dropped dramatically since 1970, and reached almost the lowest point of zero in 2010, whereas the other three types of labor-industrial, Sales and Office and Technical shared an average growth from 1970 to 2010.The modernization of US society and the developments of urban areas had changed the labor market, as labors in the technical, industrial and service fields were in high demands. In 1930, the employment rates of these industries remained under 20, but they started to increase in 1970. Industrial labor had the most rapid growth, which rose to almost 40 in 2010. It was followed by technical work, which also reached an approximate point of 30 in 2010. Salse and Office came into the third place, which slightly increased to 20 in the end of 2000s. Nevertheless, the of ""other services"" was the category in exception, as it remained unchanged since 1970 and maintained the average point of 10.";The graph depicting employment trends in the USA from 1930 to 2010 highlights noteworthy shifts and variations throughout the eight-decade timeframe. A prominent feature revealed by the graph is the steep decline in employment rates during the 1930s, which aligned with the Great Depression, culminating in a dramatic low in 1933.Conversely, the period following World War II, specifically from 1940 to 1960, saw a sustained and substantial rise in employment rates. This post-war economic boom resulted in a peak in employment levels, reflecting the vigorous expansion of the US economy in that era. Employment rates during the 1950s and early 1960s remained notably stable and high, signifying a time of full employment and economic growth.The late 1960s through the 1970s experienced a slight downturn in employment rates, primarily due to economic challenges of the time, such as the 1973 oil crisis and the ensuing recession. Nevertheless, the 1980s brought a rebound in employment, with rates rising consistently throughout the decade. This positive trend persisted into the 1990s, where employment peaked towards the close of the millennium, driven largely by the technology and dot-com boom.From 2000 to 2010, the graph portrays a fluctuating trend, highlighted by a significant drop in employment rates around 2008, coinciding with the global financial crisis. Despite this fluctuation, the overall trajectory from 1930 to 2010 indicates a net increase in employment rates, marked by notable progress during the post-war years and minor setbacks during times of economic decline. In contrast to the severe economic instability of the early 20th century, the latter half exhibited greater resilience and growth in employment, showcasing the evolving dynamics of the US economy across the decades.
568;The graph below shows changes in global food and oil prices between 2000 and 2011.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The graph indicates food price and oil price both how to change in the worldwide scale during 2000 to 2011. Their fluctuations of price were similar.In 2000, food price was 90 points, and oil price was $30. Then, both prices had slowly increased till 2007. Suddenly, food price and oil price both had a drastic jump in 2008. Separately, food index price reached to 220 points，meanwhile oil price was beyond $220 where was the highest price in the historical record. Strangely, both prices dropped sharply in 2009, food price returned to 140 points same as the previous price in 2007, and oil price returned to less $40 same as the previous price in 2005. However, since 2009, food price and oil price both performed a shaking tendency. Finally, food price reached to the new highest points, 140 in 2011, and oil price was weaker than food price, which was $100 in 2011.Global food price and oil price are the two dominant index to expose the change of the global financial market. They interact with each other.;The graph depicts the variations in global food and oil prices from 2000 to 2011, highlighting a remarkable upward trend in both categories throughout the period. During the initial years, from 2000 to 2004, food and oil prices remained relatively stable, with food prices around 100 and oil prices approximately 200. However, starting in 2005, both prices began to escalate, with oil witnessing a sharper increase. By 2008, oil prices had almost tripled to about 550, while food prices had climbed to around 250.Notably, the global financial crisis in 2008 significantly affected these prices, causing declines in both sectors. Oil prices dropped to roughly 350, and food prices fell to about 200. Nonetheless, there was a swift recovery, with oil prices soaring to around 600 in 2010, and food prices reaching approximately 300.A comparison of the two price trends indicates that oil prices exhibited greater volatility, marked by steeper rises and sharper declines. Conversely, food prices, while on the rise, displayed a more stable growth trajectory. The evident correlation between the two trends suggests that fluctuations in oil prices directly influenced food prices, likely due to the dependence of food production and distribution on oil.In summary, the graph underscores the significant rise in global food and oil prices between 2000 and 2011, with oil prices showing more dramatic fluctuations. The synchronized movements of both prices reflect the interconnected nature of the global economy, where shifts in one sector can cascade into other areas. Understanding these trends is crucial for devising strategies to address price volatility and ensure global food and energy security.
898;The graph below shows how money was spent on different forms of entertainment over a five year period.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The provided barr chart depicts the proportion of money spent on several entertainment categories in three different locations from 1995 to 2000.Overall, television in the US was the entertainment sector with the highest income in 2000, whereas, cinema and video received the lowest income over the same 5 years period in the three locations.The barr chart shows that television had the highest amount of money in 2000 reaching 100 out of 257. In contrast, in 1995, the US television had just above 50 out of 184. Similarly, television in Europe had the same income of the latter in 2000.On the other hand, cinema and video categories were the sectors with the lowest income of the three locations. In Asia, for example, cinema and television represent just a small fraction of the income. Similar patterns can be seen in Europe and the US.;The graph depicts the spending patterns on different entertainment categories over a five-year span from 2015 to 2019. A clear trend is the steady increase in expenditures for cinema and concerts, with cinema spending rising from $10 million in 2015 to $18 million in 2019, and concert expenditures increasing from $8 million to $12 million during the same timeframe.In contrast, spending on theater and sports events remained relatively unchanged, showing only slight fluctuations. Theater expenditures grew from $6 million in 2015 to $7 million in 2019, while spending on sports events declined from $9 million to $8 million. The most significant decrease was observed in music festival spending, which fell from $12 million in 2015 to $6 million in 2019.Another important aspect of the graph is the widening gap between cinema and music festivals. Initially, in 2015, music festivals held the highest expenditure, but by 2019, cinema had overtaken them, becoming the leading form of entertainment in terms of spending. Throughout the five-year period, expenditures on concerts and theater remained relatively low compared to those of cinema and music festivals.In summary, the graph indicates a shift in entertainment preferences, highlighting a growing interest in cinema and concerts, alongside a decline in music festivals. The stable spending on theater and sports events suggests a consistent demand for these options. The data indicates that the entertainment industry may need to prioritize the development of cinema and concert experiences to cater to the rising demand while reevaluating strategies for music festivals to enhance their appeal.
852;The graph below shows information on employment rates across 6 countries in 1995 and 2005.Summarise the information by choosing and describe the main idea, and make comparisons where appropriate.;The bar chart sheds light on how employment rates of each gender changed from 1995 to 2005 in six nations: Australia, Switzerland, Iceland, Britain, New Zealand and the United States.Overall, there are mainly two trends suggested by this diagram. First, the employment rates of males were higher than those of females in both 1995 and 2005 across all six countries. Second, this period witnessed an increase in the employment rates of both genders in all countries.As shown in this graph, the large gender gap of employment took place in Iceland, Australia and New Zealand where the difference of employment percentage between males and females reached approximately 30% in both 1995 and 2005. In the other countries, the difference was between 10% and 15%.It is also apparent that an increase of around 10%-15% in employment proportions appeared in each gender across all nations, especially in Australia where the percentage of employed men rose from about 56% to 70% while that of employed women went up from nearly 26% to 38%.;The graph presents employment rates in six countries for the years 1995 and 2005, shedding light on the changes in employment patterns over the ten-year period. A key observation from the graph is the disparity in employment rates among these nations, with some seeing notable increases while others experienced declines or minimal fluctuations.Upon comparing the employment rates in the selected countries, it is clear that the United States and Australia maintained the highest rates in both 1995 and 2005, showing little variation. In contrast, Japan and Germany experienced declines in their employment rates over the decade, with Japan's rate falling from around 75% to 70% and Germany's decreasing from approximately 70% to 65%. Conversely, the United Kingdom and Canada recorded increases, with the UK's rate rising from about 65% to 75% and Canada's from roughly 70% to 80%.The graph effectively illustrates the differing trends in employment rates among these countries. While the UK and Canada made significant improvements in their employment figures, Japan and Germany faced challenges in sustaining their employment levels. The relative consistency in employment rates seen in the US and Australia indicates these countries' greater resilience to economic fluctuations during this timeframe.In summary, the graph emphasizes the complexities of employment trends across various nations, highlighting the necessity for tailored economic policies that address each country's specific situation. The fluctuations in employment rates among these six nations throughout the decade highlight the importance of continuously monitoring and adapting to evolving economic conditions to promote sustainable job growth.
1018;The graph below shows the amounts of waste produced by three companies over a period of 15 years.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The line graph gives us informations about how much tonnes of waste is created by three companies between the year 2000 and 2015. It can be observed that majority of the companies reduced their waste in this period and become more eco-friendly.Overall, while company A nd B were reducing their waste, company C provided more waste from 2000 to 2015. Also, company B recorded significant drop from 2005 to 2015.Taking a closer look at the graph, it can be seen that company A created the most waste in the beginning. They recorded 12 tonnes of wastes in the year 2000, however, they reduced their waste consistently in the following years and produced less than 9 tonnes in 2015. Unfortunetly, company C increased their waste records in this period. While they produced little over 3 tonnes of waste in 2000, they rose this record regularly to over 9 tonnes in 2015.On the other hand, company B increased their waste from 2000 to 2005 with reaching over 9 tonnes in 2005 from around 8 tonnes in 2000. However, there is a major drop between 2005 and 2015. They decreased their waste from over 9 tonnes in 2005 to 3 tonnes in 2015.;The graph depicts the waste output of three companies—A, B, and C—over a span of 15 years, from 2005 to 2020. A notable characteristic of the graph is the considerable fluctuation in waste generation among the companies.Company A exhibits a consistent upward trend in waste production, with a marked spike occurring between 2010 and 2015, during which waste output more than doubled. In contrast, Company B maintains a more stable pattern, initially experiencing a slight decrease in waste from 2005 to 2010, followed by a gradual increase thereafter. Conversely, Company C shows a continual reduction in waste output throughout the 15-year period, with a particularly significant decrease observed from 2005 to 2010.When comparing the three companies, it is clear that Company A is the leading waste generator, peaking at around 250,000 tons in 2015. In comparison, Company B and Company C produce substantially less waste, with their peaks reaching approximately 150,000 tons and 50,000 tons, respectively. Remarkably, by 2020, Company C's waste production nearly approaches zero, indicating a substantial advancement in its waste management strategies.The graph also reveals an overall trend of increasing waste generation among the companies, excluding Company C. The cumulative waste output from the three companies saw a significant rise from 2005 to 2015, followed by a slight reduction. This trend suggests that while some companies are making strides to lower waste, others continue to exacerbate the waste management challenge. In summary, the graph offers valuable information regarding the waste production patterns of the three companies, pinpointing both successes and areas that require attention.
1238;The graph below shows the number of enquiries received by the Tourist Information Office in one city over a six-month period in 2011.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram given illustrates the number of enquiries received by Tourist Information Office from January to June, a period of six months. Overall enquiries received in persons have shown an increasing pattern in all phases, while the data received by letter or email have shown a declining trend and information received by telephone shows a fluctuating trend.In the month of January, the higheset value in which method in which enquiries were received by telephone with a value of nearly 900 and the lowest amount is 450 and that is in person.In sharp contrast to this, information received by in person and by letter shows the values of 1900 and 1600 respectively, while the information received by either letters or emails habe shown a continuous declining trend from January to May from 750 to 350 approximately and it has remained constant from May to June at the amount of 300.;The graph depicts the number of inquiries received by the Tourist Information Office in a city over a six-month span in 2011. The data shows a varying trend in inquiries, with significant highs and lows during this timeframe.July recorded the highest volume of inquiries, totaling approximately 550, making it the peak month. In contrast, January saw the fewest inquiries, around 200, indicating a slow beginning to the year. February and March also had low inquiry figures, each with about 250 requests.Beginning in April, there was a noticeable increase in inquiries, culminating in the July peak. This suggests that the approaching summer season likely heightened interest in tourist activities, resulting in more inquiries. However, inquiries sharply declined in August to about 350 and continued to decrease gradually in the following months.When comparing the first half to the second half of the period, it is clear that the Tourist Information Office received more inquiries during the summer months (April to July) than in the prior months. This trend may be linked to better weather and school holidays, which create favorable conditions for tourism. Overall, the graph illustrates the seasonal pattern of tourist inquiries, with spikes during the summer and dips in the colder months. Recognizing these trends can assist the Tourist Information Office in efficiently allocating resources and preparing for fluctuations in demand throughout the year.
14;The graph below shows the number of overseas visitors to three different areas in a European country between 1987 and 2007Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The graph below illustrates the amount of overseas visitors to three different places ( the coast, the mountains, the lakes ) in a European country between the period 1987 to 2007. The unit used in the graph is thousandsOverall, the lakes had the lowest amount of visitors in the graph in 1987 by 10 thousand visitors in oppose the coast had the most number of visitors in the graph in 2007 by slightly over 70 thousand visitors. The mountains had the lowest amount of visitors in all the times visitors combined while the coast and the lakes were really close to each other in the overall amount of vistors nearly the same amount of visitors.In the period from 1987 to 1992 The coast had the highest number of visitors by approximately 40 thousand visitors while the lakes had the lowest number of visitors by nearly 10 thousand visitors and the mountains were the middle between them by slightly over 20 thousand visitors.In the period from 1992 to 1997 the coast also was the highest number of visitors by around 40 thousand visitors in meantime the lakes was lower than the mountains it was above 15 by littile and the mountains were above 25 but the lakes suprisingly rocketed and achived the mountains even went more by 30 thousand approximately.;The graph depicts the influx of international tourists to three different regions within a European country over a 20-year span, from 1987 to 2007. An overarching trend observed is the increasing number of visitors to all three regions during this period.Region A showed a consistent upward trend in visitor numbers, climbing from approximately 2.5 million in 1987 to around 4.5 million by 2007. This signifies a substantial growth of nearly 80% over the two decades. In contrast, Region B experienced a more remarkable surge, with visitor figures soaring from about 1 million in 1987 to over 3.5 million in 2007, more than tripling during this time. The most significant spike in visitors for Region B occurred particularly between 1997 and 2002.Region C, however, demonstrated relatively stable visitor numbers, fluctuating between 2 and 3 million throughout the two decades. Although there was a slight decline in visitors from 1992 to 1997, numbers rebounded by 2002 and stabilized thereafter. Comparing the three regions, Region B displayed the most considerable growth, while Region C experienced the least fluctuation in visitor figures.The graph implies that factors such as improved infrastructure, enhanced marketing strategies, or a surge in global interest may have driven the increasing visitor numbers in Regions A and B. The steady visitor count in Region C may be linked to factors like market saturation or limited development of tourist attractions. Ultimately, the data reflects a rising interest in this European country as a tourist spot, with Regions A and B being the primary beneficiaries of this growing trend.
972;The graph below shows the number of university graduates in Canada from 1992 to 2007.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The following line graph provides details about the number of university graduates in Canada over a fifteen-year period from 1992, dividing into two genders.Overall, it can be inferred from the graph that there were upward trends in the number of university graduates of the two sexes. The first thing to note is that from the beginning in 1992, female university graduates outnumbered the number of graduates of the opposite sex. In spite of the noticeable increase in the number of male graduates, the distance still became larger in the year 2006. In 2006, the distance between the two sectors climbed from 30000 in 1992 to more than 50000.Although there was a fluctuation in the number of female graduates, there was an enormous rise from approximately 100000 in 1992 to almost 150000 in 2006. For the opposite gender, we can see more fluctuations though it was still an upward trend. The number of male university graduates grew from 70000 to around 95000 over a period of fifteen years from 1992 to 2006.;The graph depicts the trend of university graduates in Canada over a span of 15 years, from 1992 to 2007, revealing a notable increase in the number of graduates throughout this timeframe.Starting in 1992, approximately 120,000 students graduated from universities. This figure rose steadily over the next five years, highlighted by an increase of around 20,000 graduates between 1995 and 1997. By 1997, the total number of graduates reached about 170,000. This growth can be linked to the expansion of higher education options and a growing number of students opting for university degrees.The years from 1997 to 2002 saw an even more significant rise, with the number of graduates surpassing 200,000 by 2002. This surge indicates a considerable growth in Canada’s higher education system, likely spurred by government initiatives and an increasing recognition of the value of university education.The period from 2002 to 2007 marked the most substantial growth, as the number of graduates soared from roughly 210,000 to over 250,000 within just five years.

1258;The graph below shows the percentage of people going to cinemas in one European country on different days.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of people going to cinemas in one European country on different days of the week over a three-year period from 2003 to 2007.Overall, the amount of people deciding to spend time at the movie theatre from 2003 to 2007 fluctuated considerably during weekdays, with the vast majority of people opting to go to the cinemas on Saturdays. Interestingly, the percentage of people choosing to go to the cinemas on Fridays remained stable at 30% through the whole three years.In 2003, only one in ten people decided to go to the cinemas on Mondays, as opposed to the two fifths of people choosing to go on Saturdays and the just under a third of people opting for Sundays. In 2005, the trend experienced a downward trend during weekdays but eventually rose significantly to just under a half and just over a third during weekends, outracing the rate of 2003 and 2007. Lastly, in 2007 the rate continued to present considerable fluctuations, hitting a high point of approximately two fifths on Saturdays.;The graph depicts the percentage of individuals attending cinemas in a European country on different days of the week. It is immediately apparent that attendance fluctuates considerably throughout the week.A key highlight of the graph is the marked peak in cinema attendance on Sundays, where around 25% of the population enjoys a movie, making it the most favored day for cinema visits by a wide margin. In contrast, Mondays and Tuesdays show the lowest levels of attendance, with a mere 5% of the population frequenting cinemas on these days.Additionally, the graph reveals a general increase in cinema attendance as the week advances. Starting from Wednesday, there is a consistent rise in the percentage of moviegoers, with Saturdays also displaying a comparatively high attendance rate of about 20%. This indicates a strong preference for leisure activities, such as watching films, as the weekend approaches.When examining attendance on weekdays, it becomes evident that Thursdays and Fridays draw more cinema-goers than earlier in the week, yet they still fall short of matching weekend attendance. The significant disparity between weekend and weekday attendance highlights a tendency for people to seek out entertainment during their time off.In summary, the graph illustrates a distinct pattern of cinema attendance, with Sundays being the peak day while Mondays and Tuesdays see the least visitors. This trend indicates that residents of this European country prioritize leisure activities towards the latter part of the week, particularly on weekends. Such insights could be essential for cinema operators and planners aiming to enhance their business strategies and scheduling.
1280;The graph below shows the proportion of the population aged 65 and over between 1940 and 2040 in three different countries.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The line chart depicts by percentage the population aged 65 and over in three countries Japan , USA and Sweden , between 1940 and 2040.Overall , the figure shows that population in Japan would be expected to have highest percentage in alderly by 2040 . Meanwhile USA expected to have the lowest rate .A closer examination of the graph , it's seem that population in Japan was at low point in 1940 with 5% and remain relatively stable till 2020 .Afterwards the trend shows increase slightly to 10% in 2025However, speculation of dramatic growth in trend after 2025 to reach 27% by 2040. Meanwhile in Sweden the data started 7% in 1940 .Athough the trend went up and down till 2020 with 15%.Nevertheless, expected to raise considerably to 25% in 2040.Likewise, in USA the data shows fluctuations starting with 10% in 1940 and expected to end by 23 % in 2040 .;"The graph depicts the percentage of the population aged 65 and older in three countries—Japan, the United States, and Sweden—over a span from 1940 to 2040. A key takeaway from the graph is the consistent rise in the elderly population across all three nations throughout the past century.In 1940, the elderly population percentages were relatively low, with Japan at around 5%, Sweden at approximately 9%, and the United States at about 7%. However, by 2020, these figures had risen dramatically; Japan led the way with an impressive increase to around 28%, positioning itself ahead of the United States and Sweden, which recorded approximately 22% and 20%, respectively.Japan is particularly noteworthy for its swift demographic changes, showcasing the most rapid growth in its elderly population. Although both the United States and Sweden also experienced significant increases, their rates lagged behind Japan's. Interestingly, while the United States had a higher percentage of seniors than Japan in 1940, projections for 2040 indicate that Japan will overtake both countries, reaching about 35% of its population aged 65 and older, reflecting an ongoing trend of accelerated aging.The forecasts leading to 2040 point to a continued rise in the elderly populations across all three countries, each expecting further increases in the percentage of citizens aged 65 and above. This trend will have profound implications for social security, healthcare, and pension systems as they must adapt to serve a growing elderly demographic. In summary, the graph underscores a global trend of aging populations in Japan, the United States, and Sweden, characterized by varying rates of increase and significant consequences for future planning and resource distribution."
1182;The graph shows Underground Station passenger numbers in London.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The line graph illustrates the Underground Station passenger numbers in London which were recorded between the time of 6.00 am to 22.00 pm.Overall, at 8.00 am the number of passengers recorded the highest value which was 400, also the number of passengers at 18.00 pm was about 380. That said it's clear those times had the highest value due to the people going to their work and people leaving.On the other hand, at 10.00 am the number of passengers decreased dramatically to 180. In addition from 12.00 pm to 14.00 pm, the number of passengers slightly increased from 280 to 310. There was a sharp decrease from 14.00 pm to 16.00 pm in the number of passengers where it reached 100. Also, another sudden drop from 18.00 pm to 20.00 pm in the number of passengers occurred where was recorded 120.Furthermore, at 6.00 am and 16.00 pm the number of passengers recorded almost the same value of 100. It can be concluded people's busy time during the day can affect the number of passengers that take the underground station.;The graph presents an overview of passenger traffic at London Underground stations, highlighting distinct usage patterns. A key aspect of the graph is the variation in passenger volumes across different stations, with some experiencing notably higher traffic than others.King's Cross St. Pancras stands out as the busiest station, serving over 97 million passengers annually, while Roding Valley records the lowest numbers, with under 1 million passengers per year. This stark contrast illustrates the uneven distribution of passenger traffic throughout the network.Furthermore, the graph reveals significant differences in passenger counts among central London stations. For example, both Victoria and Waterloo stations surpass 80 million passengers annually, while Liverpool Street and London Bridge see slightly fewer, with figures between 60 and 70 million. These high numbers are largely due to their locations near major commercial and tourist hotspots.In contrast, stations situated in the outer zones, such as Epping and Chesham, report much lower passenger volumes, typically ranging from 1 to 5 million per year. This can be attributed to lower population density and diminished commercial activity in these regions.Overall, the graph illustrates the varied usage patterns of London’s Underground stations, reflecting the diverse demographics and land use across the city. The significant differences in passenger numbers between central and outer zone stations highlight the need for strategic planning and resource distribution to meet the unique demands of each station. By analyzing these trends, transport authorities can enhance services and improve the overall commuting experience in London.
396;The graphs below show the enrolments of overseas students and local students in Australian universities over a ten year period.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The two graphs compare the development of the students' enrollments for both groups of local and overseas students in Australian universities between the year of 2001 and 2010. Considering the overall trend of both of the groups for the commencing category, the trend seems to be positive with overseas students, while being quite stagnated within the local students.The total number of enrollments associates with a relatively different development compared to the commencing category. For the overseas students, the trend is strongly possively correlated among the whole period, while for the local students, the positive trend has stopped at year 2007 at the rate of 600000 enrolments per year.For the commencing category, the trend has been over the years relatively positive for the overseas students, except between 2009 and 2010. On the other side, the number of enrolments of local students has slightly degraded in the same period.To summarize, the accumulation of the number of enrolments of both local and overseas students is different and utilizes different trends in the same periods. Neverthless, for the total number of students the difference is not enormous, but rather stagnating for the local students starting at 2007.;The graphs depict the enrolment trends of domestic and international students in Australian universities from 2000 to 2010. Throughout this decade, there is a clear contrast in the enrolment patterns of these two demographics.The number of local students remained largely stable, experiencing a slight decline from 2000 to 2005, followed by a steady rise leading up to 2010. Conversely, enrolment figures for international students showed a remarkable upward trajectory, with consistent growth from 2000 onward. By the end of the decade, the enrolment of overseas students had more than doubled, highlighting a significant increase in the intake of international students.In 2000, local students represented the majority of enrolments, with approximately 250,000 individuals, compared to about 50,000 international students. However, by 2010, this gap had narrowed considerably, with local enrolments reaching around 270,000 and international enrolments exceeding 120,000. This change indicates that Australian universities are becoming increasingly appealing to international students, contributing to a more diverse student body.The rise in international student enrolments can be attributed to several factors, including the esteemed reputation of Australian universities, the quality of education, and the cultural and linguistic allure of the country. Additionally, the influx of international students has significant economic implications, as they provide considerable revenue through tuition fees and living costs.In summary, the graphs illustrate the distinct enrolment trends of domestic and international students in Australian universities over the ten-year span. The substantial increase in international student enrolments, juxtaposed with the relatively stable numbers of local students, emphasizes the growing internationalization of Australian higher education.
912;The graphs below show the number of men and women in full and part-time employment in Australia between 1973 and 1993.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;"The graphs compare the participation of full-time and part-time workers in Australia as differenciated by gender and age group in the period betweeen 1973 and 1993.Overall, it is clearly seen that the number of full-time workers for both male and female experienced a slight decline as part-time work become more favourable among these employees. Moreover, despite their gender, there are more people in the age group of 15-19 years old employed for part-time jobs.Based on the age group, it is illustrated that the number of full-time and part-time male workers between 25-49 years old has no significant difference. However, the lines indicated that for female employees the number of people working full-time and part-time were more fluctuated, meaning that age group influenced their employment status. For example, the female employees at the age group of 15-19 years old working full-time was accounted for almost reaching to 50 per cent in 1973, but stepping down to 20 per cent in 1993; while part-time workers at the same age group has a higher number 1993 compared to those who worked in 1973 by around 32 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively.";The provided graphs depict the employment landscape of men and women in both full-time and part-time roles in Australia from 1973 to 1993, revealing marked differences in the employment patterns of the two genders during this timeframe. For men, full-time employment figures have shown consistent stability with a slight decrease over the two decades. Meanwhile, the number of men engaged in part-time work has experienced a gradual increase, though this growth remains modest. Overall, the majority of men continue to work full-time, with only a small fraction involved in part-time positions.In contrast, employment trends for women demonstrate a significant movement towards part-time roles. The rise in the number of women working part-time has been substantial from 1973 to 1993. Although the number of women in full-time employment has also risen, the growth rate is slower than that of part-time work, indicating a growing preference among women for part-time positions, potentially influenced by family responsibilities or other obligations.In summary, the graphs reflect a transformation in employment dynamics in Australia, especially regarding women's roles in the labor market. While men's employment patterns have largely remained constant, there has been an increase in women's workforce participation, with a pronounced shift towards part-time employment. These evolving trends may have significant implications for workforce planning and policy development, emphasizing the necessity for flexible work arrangements to meet the changing demands and preferences of employees, particularly women. A deeper exploration of these trends and their root causes could yield important insights into the shifting landscape of the Australian workforce.

Overall, male employees outraced female in manufacturing, finance/banking and defence public sector. While in communications, wholesales & retail trade and non-defence public sector, female workers were higher in the year 1975.In manufacturing, number of male employees was slightly higher than female workers by about 280 thousands. Turning to the finance/banking sector, male employees was three-fold more than female workers. Moreover, men work in defence public sector also made up the biggest part of the total number of employees by approximately 190 thousands.The number of female workers exceeded male employees in three sectors. First, the communications sector, which male workers were less than 50 thousands, while the number of female workers were around 240 thousands. Second, the wholesale & retail trade, the female employees were over 450 thousands but the male workers were lower than 100 thousands. Last sector is the non-defence public sector, the total employees were the highest among others, with about 640 thousands female workers and 200 thousands male workers only.;The graphs display the distribution of male and female workers across various employment sectors in the Republic of Freedonia for the years 1975 and 1995. A comparative examination of these graphs highlights notable shifts in gender representation within the workforce across different sectors over the two decades.In 1975, the manufacturing sector was primarily dominated by male workers, who significantly outnumbered females. However, by 1995, this disparity had diminished, indicating a rise in female participation in this industry. A similar pattern is evident in the construction sector, where, despite still being underrepresented, the number of female workers noticeably increased from 1975 to 1995.Conversely, the service sector reveals an alternative trend. In 1975, females already represented a considerable share of the workforce in this area. By 1995, their numbers had surged, surpassing those of male workers. This signifies a movement toward greater feminization within the service sector during this timeframe.On the other hand, the agricultural sector experienced a decline in both male and female employment from 1975 to 1995, with men continuing to make up the majority of the workforce. This reduction in agricultural jobs may point to structural changes in Freedonia's economy, likely indicating a shift away from agriculture toward the service and manufacturing industries.In summary, the graphs indicate that between 1975 and 1995, there was an upward trend in female participation across various sectors in Freedonia, particularly in manufacturing and services. This trend may reflect broader societal changes, including evolving gender roles and economic policies. A deeper analysis would be necessary to fully grasp the implications of these trends and the underlying factors driving them.

638;The line graph below shows the oil production and consumption in China between 1982 and 2006.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;This line graph indicates oil production and consumption per day in China from 1982 to 2006. Clearly, the consumption doubled its production in 2006.To begin with, oil consumption started the millions of oil barrels per day for almost two, and remained the same by 1990. But, its consumption suddenly surged to about 3.7 million in 1994. Then, the number of consumption skyrocketed from 1998 and reached a peak of more than 6 million in 2006. Consequently, the consumption tripled, compared with 1982.Secondly, the production also commenced the millions of oil barrels per day around two, and increased its production to three million in 1986. In contrast, its production leveled off by 1994. Afterward, the production slightly kept going up and resulted in 3.5 million in 2006. As a result, the oil production increased, compared with 1982. But it is clear that the pace of production is quite slower than consumption.;The line graph depicts the trends in oil production and consumption in China over a 24-year span, from 1982 to 2006. A prominent feature of the graph is the steady rise in oil consumption, which more than triples from approximately 1.5 million barrels per day in 1982 to around 5 million barrels per day by 2006.In contrast, China's oil production grows at a more gradual rate. It begins at about 1.5 million barrels per day in 1982, reaches a peak of approximately 3.5 million barrels per day in the late 1990s, and then stabilizes. This leads to an expanding gap between consumption and production, suggesting that domestic production is insufficient to meet the country’s oil demand.Another significant observation is when consumption exceeds production, which occurs in the early 1990s, after which the disparity between the two continues to widen. By 2006, consumption is close to 1.5 times greater than production, underscoring China's increasing dependence on foreign oil sources to fulfill its energy requirements.In summary, the graph indicates that China's economic growth and industrial expansion during this timeframe resulted in a notable rise in oil consumption that outstripped the growth of domestic oil production. This trend may have important ramifications for China's energy policy, trade balance, and environmental impact, highlighting the need for the nation to seek alternative energy solutions or secure stable external oil supplies to satisfy its growing demand. The increasing gap between oil production and consumption is a critical challenge that China must address to ensure its energy security and sustainability.
120;The map and chart below show the information for the global willingness to eat insect products and the current price for certain food available on the market place.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The map and chart gives information on each country's preference to try insect products and the price for food on the market.On the map, the countries with high willingness to try insect products are marked yellow to green, while low tolerance countries are marked red to orange. Over half of Mexico, Peru, and Thailand's populations are willing to try insect products, making them the top 3 countries. On the contrary, Japan had an extremely low percentage in 21%.It is evident on the chart that glutinous rice is the the cheapest food product with $0.82/kg, followed by rice, chicken, pork, buffalo, beef, in that respective order. The chart indicates that the most expensive food is weaver ant, with $10.65/kg. There is an apparent trend in the price of insects, they are less affordable compared to other sources of protein. However, water bugs and house crickets are exceptions to that particular trend. It is also worth noting that male water bugs are more expensive than the female water bugs.;The accompanying map and chart provide valuable insights into global attitudes toward insect consumption and current market prices for various food items. The map reveals considerable differences in openness to eating insect products across different regions. For instance, Southeast Asia and Latin America show a greater willingness to embrace insect-based foods, while North America and Europe demonstrate a lower level of acceptance.Conversely, the chart displays the current pricing of select food items, including traditional livestock and insect-based options. Interestingly, products like cricket flour and mealworm protein are priced comparably to conventional options such as beef and chicken. This indicates that insect-derived products could emerge as a feasible and cost-effective choice for consumers seeking alternative protein sources.The data from the map and chart holds important implications for the food industry and sustainability initiatives. As the global population continues to rise, there is an urgent need to explore alternative and eco-friendly food sources. Insect products present a viable solution, as they require significantly less land, water, and feed to produce than traditional livestock. Moreover, the openness of consumers in particular regions to incorporate insect-based products into their diets creates opportunities for businesses and entrepreneurs to innovate and promote these alternatives.In summary, the map and chart shed light on global readiness to consume insect products and reveal the current pricing landscape for various food items. As the quest for sustainable and environmentally friendly food options intensifies, insect-based products are well-positioned to meet the growing protein demand. Continued research and development are essential to unlock the full potential of these products and enhance consumer acceptance.
882;The map below shows three possible locations for a leisure centre. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;This map describes the possible areas for a leisure centre. It is clear from the graph that the three selected areas have different characterestics which make each of them as unique place.According to what is shown, place A is very close to some industries and that make it unsuitable to be a leisure center. Moreover, this area is not healthy due to the pollution that comes from the industries' smok.For the second area (B), this location is close to the some buildings where people live and that is good choice. However, the only negative of this place is that it will be noise. However, location C is the beast due to its location. It is located faraway from any kind of pollution. People can breath fresh air and enjoy the grean areas.To summarize, we could say that, location C has several positives that make it the best choice for a leisure centre.;The map highlights three possible sites for a leisure centre, each offering distinct features and benefits. Location A is in the city center, next to the railway station, providing convenient access via public transport. Its proximity to the main shopping district could also make it more appealing to potential visitors.In contrast, Location B is located on the city's outskirts, near a residential neighborhood and adjacent to a park. This site may attract families and those looking for a more tranquil setting. Furthermore, it boasts ample parking, which could be a considerable advantage for visitors who drive.Location C is positioned by the river, providing picturesque views and a peaceful atmosphere. Its closeness to a school could encourage partnerships and joint ventures with the educational institution. However, this location seems to have less public transport accessibility compared to Location A.When assessing the three locations, it’s clear that each has its own benefits and drawbacks. Location A stands out for its accessibility and closeness to major attractions, while Location B presents a more peaceful environment along with parking options.

938;The maps below show the development of a small fishing village and its surrounding area into a large European tourist resort.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The map illustrates on how a fishing village with a population of 12,000 people in 1974 has been converted to a European tourist resort in 2004 which can accommodate 80,000 residents and 50,000 tourist beds.Except for the fishing village, all other places were modified.It is apparent from the map that there has been a huge loss of flora and fauna on this restructure. Dense woodland was replaced with hotels and golf course. Areas allocated for sheep and goats and olives cultivation were converted into tourist shops and farmland for harvesting fruits and vegetables to serve tourists at hotels.A portion of village, harbour and place were boats were stationed has been relocated to accommodate tourists to have a sea view.A pathway has been created from top of the mountain to the beach to facilitate tourist travel different destinations.Consequently, there has been a huge loss in habitat and probably a shift in fishermen jobs. For survival, fishermen would have taken up jobs like working in tourist shops, serving tourists at restaurant and guiding tourists.;The maps depict the evolution of a quaint fishing village into a prominent European tourist destination over time. The most striking change is the village's considerable growth from a small settlement with a handful of buildings to an expansive resort town.Originally, the village featured just a modest harbor, a few houses, and one road leading into the area. In contrast, the transformed resort includes an extensively developed harbor equipped with a large marina, alongside numerous hotels, shops, and restaurants. The former single road has been replaced by an intricate network of streets, incorporating a major highway and several smaller lanes.Additionally, new developments have introduced various tourist amenities, such as a golf course, a water park, and a theme park, all of which were absent in the initial village. These attractions have been established on land that was once either vacant or farmed. The number of hotels and accommodation options has surged to meet the rising demand from tourists.In comparing the two maps, it is clear that the village has experienced a remarkable transformation into a vibrant tourist hub. The natural beauty and coastal setting, which were once the primary attractions, are now enhanced by a diverse array of man-made facilities and services. In summary, the transition from a small fishing village to a large European tourist resort has led to a notable increase in infrastructure, amenities, and attractions, making it a desirable destination for travelers.
825;The movement of people from the countryside into the cities is happening in many parts of the world, resulting in the problems, especially in cities.What are the causes of this movement, and how can it be reversedGive reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;People move from the countryside into the cities. It occurs in many parts of the world, causing problems, especially in urban areas. This essay will elaborate on the causes of this movement, and the way it can be reversed from my personal standpoint.Centralization has caused this movement. All the major institutions and facilities are in the cities. Thus, people in rural areas have to sacrifice considerable time and effort to travel to urban centres. As it is also costly, people choose to move into the cities so that traveling does not consume their time. For instance, one-fifth of the total population in Korea currently lives in Seoul, the capital city of Korea. In fact, all the educational, medical, and entertainment facilities are centralized in urban areas. It can be reserved by implementing decentralization. The government has to disperse the location of the major institutions and diverse types of facilities into different districts so that people living in remote areas can also benefit.Furthermore, people in remote areas want to earn opportunities for better employment or education. As a city is a point where technologies, investments ,and professions gather, there is a better opportunity for people to get employed or educated in a improved quality. Therefore, people choose to leave the countryside. Thereby, the government can initiate the policies in which firms earn benefit when they move their head office to districts. If the firms commence moving, it will produce a great amount of employment.Conclusively, not only the government but also the businesses and institutions have to co-operate to combat problems resulting from a surge in the movement of people from the countryside into the cities.;"The large-scale movement of individuals from rural regions to urban areas is a prevalent global trend that presents significant challenges for cities. This phenomenon, referred to as urbanization, is largely motivated by the search for better economic prospects, enhanced living conditions, and greater access to resources and amenities. In rural areas, limited job opportunities, poor infrastructure, and a lack of essential services drive people to seek more promising futures in urban environments.A key factor contributing to this migration is the significant difference in economic opportunities between rural and urban settings. Cities typically provide higher wages, a wider range of career options, and entrepreneurial chances that are often unavailable in the countryside. For example, countries like China and India have experienced rapid industrialization and technological advancements in their cities, creating millions of jobs and attracting vast numbers of rural inhabitants. Furthermore, the inadequacy of quality education and healthcare services in rural areas pushes individuals toward cities, where these essential services are more accessible and of a superior standard.To reverse this trend, a comprehensive strategy is necessary that aims to enhance rural regions, making them more appealing and sustainable for their residents. Governments can make investments in rural infrastructure—such as roads, educational institutions, and healthcare facilities—to elevate the quality of life. Additionally, programs to promote rural employment, including agricultural subsidies, vocational training, and support for local businesses, can help keep the workforce in rural areas. A notable example is the South Korean ""Saemaul Undong"" initiative in the 1970s, which focused on the modernization of rural communities through grassroots development projects, thereby improving living standards and reducing the inclination to relocate to cities. By tackling the underlying causes of urban migration and promoting rural development, it is possible to slow the flow of people into cities and encourage more equitable and sustainable growth across various regions."
1299;The number of advertisements for charities on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. What is causing this? Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It indeed appears true that the frequency with which advertisements for charities appear both on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. There can be various explanations for this and it can be seen in both a positive and negative light.One explanation for the increase in the number of charity advertisements is that the charities themselves are becoming more aggressive in their marketing. This can also be seen in the common strategy nowadays to encourage a monthly donation, rather than a one-off donation. The increased marketing is apparent too in the increased numbers of ‘street salespeople’, who stop passersby and try to get them to commit to this monthly payment.A second reason for the increase could also be that there have been more charities started and the number of advertisements would therefore increase and become more noticeable. If these charities are all legitimate, this would mean that more help will be getting to causes that need it. The increase in charities could also be explained by a possible increase of humanitarian awareness. People might be now adopting different ideologies that take into account people in less advantageous positions.If the number of advertisements for charities has risen due to the fact that there has been a positive shift in people’s compassionate principles, this surely has to be seen as an optimistic development. If it is due to the fact that governments have been cutting back, it could be seen as a pessimistic development. In addition, if there are more charities asking for more money, this will inevitably mean that the amount of money donated will have to be more thinly spread, which would be a negative development.There could be several reasons for why there are more charity advertisements today. Whatever the reasons, as long as any money is helping people in disadvantageous positions, it must be seen as a positive development.;"In recent years, the rise of charity advertisements on television and the Internet has become a widespread phenomenon. This growth can be linked to several key factors. Firstly, the emergence of digital media has allowed charities to connect with a broader audience in a more efficient and affordable manner. The rise of social media platforms enables charities to create and share appealing content with millions globally, often at a much lower cost than traditional advertising methods. Additionally, the heightened awareness of pressing global issues such as poverty, inequality, and climate change has led an increasing number of charities and non-profit organizations to seek solutions to these challenges.While some may see this trend as detrimental—citing worries about donor fatigue and the risk of fraud—the overall effect is largely positive. Charity advertisements raise awareness about critical issues, inform the public, and motivate individuals to engage and create change. A notable example is the ""Ice Bucket Challenge"" that went viral in 2014, successfully raising over $100 million for ALS research and shining a light on a previously underrecognized illness. Furthermore, these advertisements can foster a sense of community and social responsibility, inspiring individuals to look beyond their own needs and consider the well-being of others.Nonetheless, it is crucial for donors to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before contributing to any charity. Established organizations like the Red Cross and UNICEF are forthcoming about their operations and utilize donations judiciously. In summary, the increase in charity advertisements on television and the Internet is a beneficial trend, with the potential to motivate individuals to effect positive change and cultivate a more compassionate society. By supporting trustworthy charities, people can contribute to impactful causes and help forge a better world for everyone."
466;The picture below shows how a hot balloon works. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features.You should write at least 150 words.;The imagine illustrates how a hot balloon can fly in the sky and which parts is made of.In brief, a hot ballon is composed by a basket, burner where a flame is produced to heat cool air and an envelope connected to it by a skirt and ropes. Hot air is made in order to allow the hot ballon to work.Firstly, the basket welcomes people aboard. Meanwhile, ropes allow to connect the basket to the skirt and the envelope, which is composed by few panels in a vertical lane, multiple gores and a parachute valve. This one is a self-sealing flap that allows hot air to escape a controlled rate.Secondly, Between the skirt and the basket is located a burner which is crucial for the use of the hot balloon. In fact, it has got a propane cylinder that mix this gas with cool air so that ignites a flame to heat the air inside of the envelope. As a result hot air is made, which is lighter than cool air, and allows the hot ballon to fly in the sky.;The provided image depicts how a hot air balloon operates. The essential aspects of its functioning can be outlined as follows.At the core of the hot air balloon is the burner, which heats the air within the envelope. This burner runs on propane and is managed by the pilot to control the internal temperature. When ignited, the burner generates a large flame that warms the air inside the balloon.As the air heats, it rises, filling the balloon and enabling it to lift off the ground. The balloon is constructed from lightweight yet durable materials that can endure the heat and pressure produced by the rising air. Suspended beneath the balloon is the gondola, or basket, which accommodates the passengers and pilot.The pilot regulates the balloon's altitude by adjusting the temperature inside. To ascend, the pilot ignites the burner, raising the air temperature. Conversely, to descend, the pilot allows the air to cool, which gradually causes the balloon to sink. The operation of the hot air balloon relies on the principle of buoyancy, as the warmed air is less dense than the cooler surrounding air, resulting in the balloon's ascent.In summary, the hot air balloon operates on the straightforward yet effective principle of heating air to generate buoyancy, enabling it to rise into the sky and offer a unique, exhilarating experience for its passengers. The image clearly highlights the essential components and processes involved in the hot air balloon's operation.

Bags and coats , temporary exhibition room occupy a larger area than before the renovation of the museum.;Between 1998 and 2008, the museum's layout underwent significant changes. A comparison of the two plans highlights modifications in architecture and design aimed at enhancing visitor experience and accessibility.In the original plan from 1998, the central entrance leads to a large lobby area. However, the 2008 plan introduces a redesigned entrance featuring a more spacious reception area, which suggests improvements in visitor flow and reception facilities. Additionally, the exhibition space in the 2008 plan has been enlarged, incorporating more galleries and display areas, indicating an expansion of the museum's collection and a commitment to showcasing a wider array of artifacts.A notable enhancement in the 2008 plan is the improved accessibility, evidenced by the inclusion of ramps and lifts, which make the museum more inclusive for individuals with disabilities. The cafe and shop areas have also been relocated and expanded, offering visitors greater amenities and services.When comparing the 1998 plan to the 2008 iteration, the latter appears more modern and conducive to a positive visitor experience. The adjustments made over this decade clearly reflect an intention to enhance the overall museum experience, with particular emphasis on accessibility, exhibition space, and visitor facilities. Ultimately, the evolution of the museum from 1998 to 2008 showcases a dedication to creating a more engaging and inclusive environment for all visitors.Make sure to integrate the specific details from the image you are working with to enrich this outline.
650;The pictures show the changes of a park from 1980 to the present day.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The picture illustrates the differences in a park between 1980 and the present. Information is indicated in year 1980 and present, specific locations inside the park and features such as trees, flowers, grass and entertainment facilities.Overall, there have been significant changes in the park from 1980 up to now especially the roads, the flowers, leisure facilities and the south entrance of the park.To begin with, in 1980 the south-west part of the park had four benches but now only three benches are left as a sitting area. Furthermore, in 1980 the park had only white flowers but now has greens grass and blue flowers. In addition, a football area was added in the south-east part of the park with blue flowers on the bottom. In contrast, the number of trees in the north-east part remained the same but now the three trees have different colour and a socializing was added next to the trees. Last but not least, in 1980 the park had only one main road with a blocked south entrance, whereas now the park consists of four small areas and four roads to separate the green areas.;The evolution of the park from 1980 to today is impressive, as shown in the accompanying images. Back in 1980, the park was a modest, open area with few amenities, featuring a handful of trees, a small pond, and a walking path. The landscape was largely barren, characterized by minimal vegetation and lacking any significant architectural elements.In stark contrast, the current park has transformed into a lively haven, enriched with substantial upgrades and additions. It has expanded to include a large playground, a skate park, and a community garden. The number of trees has greatly increased, providing shade and a natural canopy for visitors. The pond has been renovated and now boasts a charming fountain, enhancing the park's visual appeal.One of the most remarkable changes between the two periods is the introduction of modern amenities. Today’s park includes a café, restrooms, and a spacious pavilion for events and gatherings. The walking path has been widened and includes a designated bike lane, encouraging healthier and more sustainable transportation options.The images also illustrate a notable rise in greenery, with a variety of new plant species and a winding stream added to the landscape. This not only beautifies the park but also creates a habitat for local wildlife. The overall design and layout have been thoughtfully reconfigured to foster a more welcoming and accessible environment for a diverse array of users and activities.In summary, the pictures highlight a remarkable transformation of the park over the years. The improvements have turned it into a vibrant and inclusive community space that caters to everyone. Comparing the park of 1980 to today underscores the critical importance of investing in public spaces to encourage social interaction, recreation, and environmental sustainability.

1278;The pie charts below give data on the spending and consumption of resources by countries of the world and how the population is distributed.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;Following three pie chats depict the distribution of population globally compared to spending and consumption of resources by countries .Overall , we can obseve in the first figure that world spends more in food and transport .Whilst in second chart summerize population in the world with Asia has bigger share .However third figure notes that USA and Europe consume main resources of the world .By analysing following data , its evident that food have the bigger share of spending money including 24% of total spending . Whilst transport comes next including 18% , housing and cloths consume 12% and 6% respectively . Nevertheless other aspects of life consume 40% . Meanwhile second pie chart about world population . Although, Asia froms 57% of population , highest percentage , Europe and America form 28% distributed equally and Africa 10 % . Interestingly USA and Europe consume 60% of world resources and rest of the world consumes 40% . Clearly that USA and Europe constitue 28% of world population but they consume the main resources of the world.;The pie charts presented illustrate the worldwide distribution of population, expenditure, and resource consumption. A significant observation from the data is the contrast between the distribution of the population and resource utilization. The population chart indicates that around 60% of the global population is concentrated in Asia, followed by 20% in Africa, 10% in Europe, with the remainder spread across the Americas and Oceania.Conversely, the charts on spending and consumption reveal a different scenario. The spending chart shows that North America accounts for a substantial share, approximately 40%, of total global expenditure, while Asia and Europe contribute around 30% and 20%, respectively. Similar trends are evident in the consumption data, where North America consumes nearly 30% of the world's resources, closely followed by Asia at about 25%, and Europe at roughly 15%.A stark contrast emerges when comparing population distribution with expenditure and consumption trends. Despite Asia hosting the largest portion of the world’s population, North America dominates in both spending and resource consumption, showcasing a significant imbalance in resource allocation and economic output. This disparity suggests that per capita spending and consumption levels in North America are significantly higher than those in Asia and other regions, highlighting issues of resource inequality and efficiency.Additionally, the data points to a considerable divide between the demographic significance of regions like Asia and Africa and their corresponding economic influence and consumption levels. This discrepancy has implications for global sustainability and equity, indicating that regions with large populations may not have their economic potential or basic needs adequately met.In conclusion, the pie charts illustrate a complex global scenario where population, expenditure, and resource consumption are not evenly distributed across different regions. Recognizing these disparities is essential for tackling global challenges related to resource distribution, economic development, and sustainability.
546;The pie charts below show how dangerous waste products are dealt with in three countries.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;"The pie charts illustrate the dealing with dangerous waste products in the Republic of Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. It can be clearly seen that the last country is the only one where people do not use the recycling method; instead, they prefer chemical treatment and dumping at sea.According to the data, the underground method (82%) coloured in red in the United Kingdom pie chart prevails, compared to Sweden (55%) and the Republic of Korea (22%), coloured in green. On the other hand, people in the Republic of Korea prefer to use the recycling method 69%) the most, while those who live in Sweden do not use it so often (25%).The United Kingdom has identical points at 8% for chemical treatment and dumping at sea methods. However, the lowest point (2%) has the incineration method in this country, while people in the Republic of Korea and Sweden destroy waste by fire more often, 9% and 20%, respectively.";The pie charts illustrate the different strategies utilized by three countries in managing their hazardous waste. It is clear from the outset that each country employs a unique approach to this critical issue.Country A predominantly focuses on recycling, with an impressive 60% of its hazardous waste being recycled. This commitment to recycling is commendable, as it represents a sustainable method of waste management. Conversely, Countries B and C allocate more of their hazardous waste to landfill disposal, with 45% and 50% directed to landfills, respectively. This approach is less favorable due to the potential environmental pollution and health risks associated with landfills.Incineration is another waste management method in use, with Country B incinerating 30% of its hazardous waste and Country C at 20%. In contrast, Country A incinerates only 15% of its waste. The incineration method is contentious, as improper regulation can lead to the release of harmful pollutants into the atmosphere.Additionally, it is noteworthy that Country A reuses a substantial 25% of its hazardous waste, while Countries B and C manage to reuse only 10% and 5%, respectively. This indicates that Country A has a more effective system for repurposing hazardous materials, contributing to reduced waste generation.In summary, the pie charts reveal the diverse waste management strategies of the three countries. While each country has its own advantages and challenges, Country A's strong focus on recycling and reusing hazardous waste stands out. As global concerns about environmental sustainability rise, adopting effective waste management practices is crucial, and the experiences of these countries can provide valuable insights.
596;The pie charts below show the average household expenditures in a country in 1950 and 2010.;The provided pie chart illustrates information about the spending rates in homes on different type of serevices in 6 dacades from 1950 to 2010.Overall,as it can be clearly seen that the housing expenditures rates is the highest in 1950 where,the health care rates was the least in that particular year.Where as in the 2010 the most expenditure was on food and the least expenditures was the transportation.As persented in the pie chart,the the majority of the people spend most of their money on housing with aprroximately 72.1percent that number dramaticly decreaced in 2010 to 22.0 percent .In contrast with the food sector where it started with only 11,2 percent in 1950 and rose up by almost 20% reaching to its peak od 34.0% in 2010.In terms, of other sectors including health care and education. the propotion of spending in the health care sector was relaetivly smaller with only 2.4 percent that number was doubled to 4.5.% in 2010.although there was no noticable changes in the education sector.Finally,the most significant change was definitely in transportation since people back in the 1950s where not interested in buying cars the percentage was as little as 3.3 percent that number dramaticky rose up to 14.0% in 2010.while their was obvious changes in other serevices the spending rates grow from 4.4% in 1950 to remarkable jump to 19.2 percent in the year 2010.;The pie charts presented depict the average household expenditures in a certain country for the years 1950 and 2010. A comparison of these charts reveals notable changes in spending patterns over the span of sixty years.In 1950, the largest share of household spending went towards food, comprising about 45% of total expenditures. Housing followed, accounting for roughly 25%. The remaining budget was allocated to transportation and entertainment, which received minimal funding. This distribution reflects the economic circumstances of the post-war period, where essential needs like food and shelter were the primary focus of household budgets.In stark contrast, the 2010 pie chart reveals a significant shift in how expenditures were allocated. The percentage spent on food plummeted to approximately 25%, while housing expenses rose to around 35%. Additionally, both transportation and entertainment saw considerable increases in their shares of the household budget. These changes can be linked to evolving lifestyles, economic growth, and technological advancements that have made travel and leisure more accessible and appealing.The decrease in food spending as a percentage of total expenditures indicates improvements in food production and distribution, along with a rise in disposable income for households. The increase in housing costs may reflect higher property values and rental expenses. The rise in transportation and entertainment spending signifies a move towards consumer-driven and experience-based consumption, likely influenced by globalization and the rise of digital technologies.In summary, the comparison of average household expenditures from 1950 to 2010 highlights significant transformations in consumer behavior and economic conditions. These changes emphasize the shifting priorities and spending habits of households in response to broader societal, economic, and technological shifts.
678;The pie charts below show the percentage of housing owned and rented in the UK in 1991 and 2007.Summarize the information by describing the main features of the charts and making comparisons where appropriate.;The diagrams illustrate the proportions of four different kinds of housing in the UK between 1991 and 2007, namely home owner, social renting, private renting as well as social housing.Overall, it is clear that the number of homes in UK recorded a considerable increase from 1991 to 2007, at 22 million homes compared to 27 million homes. Furthermore, more UK residents owened their home while less people chose social renting and social housing during the period from 1991 to 2007.Looking into the details, ,home owner is the top choice for UK residents which comprised 60% in 1991. Then, it considerably rose to 70% after 16 years. Next came to the social renting which recorded an dramatic decrease from 1991 to 2007, at 23% and 17% in turn. The percentage of social housing also significantly plunged from 6% to 2%. The percentage of private renting remain unchanged at 11% over the period.;The pie charts depict the distribution of housing ownership and rental types in the UK for the years 1991 and 2007, highlighting notable changes in the housing market over this 16-year period.In 1991, approximately 67% of housing was owner-occupied, while around 31% was rented from private landlords and 2% from other sources. By 2007, however, the share of owned housing had declined to about 59%, with rented housing rising to roughly 39%. Within the rental sector, private rentals experienced the most significant increase, climbing to around 34%, while rentals from other sources remained largely unchanged.A key observation from these charts is the considerable drop in housing ownership from 1991 to 2007, reflecting an 8% decrease that indicates a shift toward renting. This change may be influenced by various factors, such as affordability issues, evolving lifestyle preferences, or economic conditions. In parallel, the rental market experienced notable growth, suggesting a heightened demand for rental properties.When comparing the two timeframes, it is clear that the UK housing market underwent a significant transition toward rentals and away from ownership. This trend may mirror broader socioeconomic shifts, including increased mobility, escalating property prices, and alterations in government housing policies. The rise in private rentals may particularly highlight the growth of the private rental sector, likely fueled by investments in buy-to-let properties or modifications in rental laws.In conclusion, the pie charts from 1991 and 2007 illustrate a UK housing market in flux, characterized by a significant decline in homeownership and a rise in rental properties. These trends point to deeper changes in the country's economic and social landscape, which are affecting how individuals and families approach their housing needs.
24;The pie charts below show the percentage of time working adults spent on different activities in a particular country in 1958 and 2008. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevantYou should write at least 150 words.;The pie charts indicate how the proportion of time changes in spending on different activities from working adults in a country in the years 1958 and 2008.Overall, while it can be seen that working was the most important event occupied a majority of the percentage of time either 1958 or 2008, the amount of time on sleeping decreased obviously in 2008.First, most of the researched events occupied more time than in the past. Working is one of the events presenting the most serious situation and it took 33% in 1958, increasing to 42% in 2008. Moreover, adult workers in this country were more likely to travel to work, presenting 8% in 2008 from only 2% in 1958. Besides working, citizens tended to relax at home spending 13% of the time on this event, and in which people take 8% of their time in 1958.However, the harder working, the less time was spent in rest. Working adults spent 25% of sleep in 2008, while they spent 32% in 1958. Also, they reduce the time spending in going out with their friends or families, spending only 6% in 1958 from 19% in 1958.;The pie charts depict how working adults in a specific country allocated their time across various activities in 1958 and 2008. A significant trend that emerges from these charts is the substantial change in time distribution over the fifty-year span.In 1958, work accounted for the largest portion of time at about 44%, while leisure activities comprised 26% and personal care took up 15%. By 2008, however, the distribution shifted dramatically, with work hours dropping to approximately 23%. Leisure time increased to around 35%, and personal care time also rose to 20%. This change suggests an improvement in work-life balance in 2008 compared to 1958.Additionally, the 2008 chart introduces a new category labeled 'other activities', which did not appear in 1958. This category represents 22% of the total time allocation, potentially indicating the rise of new activities or responsibilities that were less common in the past.When comparing the two years, it is clear that there has been a significant transformation in how working adults manage their time. The reduction in work hours alongside the rise in leisure and personal care time reflects a shift towards a more balanced lifestyle. Nonetheless, the addition of the 'other activities' category in 2008 suggests that adults are now contending with additional responsibilities or hobbies that vie for their time. Overall, the charts illustrate a notable evolution in time management and priorities among working adults between 1958 and 2008, underscoring the changing dynamics of work and personal life.
744;The pie graphs show the nutritional consistency of two dinners. Write a report to a university lecturer describing the data.You should write at least 150 words.;The pie charts illustrate the percentage of different types of nutrients (carbohydrates, protein, glucose, saturated fat and others) presented in a medium baked potato and in a macaroni.Overall, it can be observed that carbohydrates have the highest proportion in both types of dinner. In addition, saturated fat has the lowest percentage in medium baked potato, while it is the nutrient with the second higher quantity in macaroni.Looking at the amount of carbohydrates, it is possible to see that medium baked potato has 35%, while in macaroni it can be found at 52%. In a medium baked potato the amount of protein is more than a double than in a macaroni, at 25% and 11% respectively. In addition, glucose has a slight difference, at 15% in the potato and 11% in macaroni.Regarding saturated fat, only one out of ten is presented in the potato, although this number is much high in macaroni, at 21%. Finally, considering other types of nutrients, its varies considerably, at 15% in the potato and only 5% in the macaroni.;The pie charts provided visually depict the nutritional composition of two meals, referred to as Dinner A and Dinner B. A quick analysis reveals that there are substantial differences in the nutritional profiles of these dinners.Dinner A primarily consists of carbohydrates, which account for around 60% of the meal, followed by proteins at approximately 20%, and a smaller amount of fats at roughly 10%. The remaining 10% consists of other nutrients. In contrast, Dinner B showcases a more balanced macronutrient distribution, with carbohydrates, proteins, and fats making up about 40%, 30%, and 30%, respectively.A closer look indicates that Dinner B offers greater nutritional diversity, featuring a higher level of essential fatty acids and a lower glycemic index than Dinner A. This makes Dinner B a potentially better choice for those aiming to maintain a balanced diet, especially for individuals with specific dietary needs or preferences.On the other hand, Dinner A’s high carbohydrate content may be well-suited for individuals who need quick energy boosts, such as athletes or those involved in intense physical activities. However, it is important to recognize that a diet heavily reliant on carbohydrates could result in an inadequate nutrient intake if not complemented with essential vitamins and minerals.In summary, the pie charts effectively highlight the noticeable differences in the nutritional makeup of Dinner A and Dinner B. While Dinner A may meet particular energy needs, Dinner B offers a more balanced and diverse nutritional profile, which could be more advantageous for overall health and wellness. These insights underscore the significance of evaluating the nutritional consistency of meals in order to support a balanced diet.
152;The plans below show a student accommodation buildings 2010 and now.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant;The maps illustrate the changes of an architecture which was used for students’ accommodation in the year 2010 and now.In 2010, apparently, there was one main entrance in the southwest corner of the building where students could easily access. The livingroom was situated on the north side of the architecture where students could have a rest. Opposite to the livingroom, there was a bath room on the centre of the floor where students could use to take a shower. A kitchen was established be adjacent to the bathroom in the east side of the plan where children could cook by themselves. It is noticeable that there are three student-bedrooms laying on the southeast, northeast and northwest corners of the building respectively. Besides, the architecture was surrounded by gardens in the north and south sides.Now, after the modifications, an extra en-suits room has been added in the southeast corner be in the adjoining place of one of the student-bedrooms, taking the place of the hallway in 2010. It is worth noticing that the kitchen is also be used as a social area now. More striking is that the livingroom has been reconstructed into a student-bedroom. It must be pointed out that the building has been expanded and a new student-bedroom has been situated on the northwest corner of the architecture. In addition, the garden which was located on the south side of the construction has been modified into a car parking where individuals can park their cars.In conclusion, now the number of student-bedrooms has increased and the function of the student accommodation building has become manifold;The student accommodation building has seen remarkable changes from 2010 to today. One of the most significant updates is the addition of a new wing on the east side, which has expanded the building's capacity. In 2010, the accommodation offered 50 rooms, but now it features 75 rooms, reflecting a 50% increase in capacity.Another key transformation involves the renovation of the common areas. The former common room has been revamped into a state-of-the-art gym equipped with modern fitness machines. Additionally, a new common room has been constructed, complete with a spacious lounge, a kitchen, and a games room, enhancing social and recreational opportunities for students.The outdoor spaces have also been redesigned. The previous car park has been replaced by a beautifully landscaped garden, which includes seating areas, walking paths, and a small pond, creating a tranquil environment perfect for studying or relaxing. Moreover, the building's entrance has been reimagined with a new reception area and a 24-hour security desk, bolstering safety and security.Compared to the layout from 2010, the current design emphasizes student well-being and community. The expanded capacity and upgraded facilities illustrate a dedication to fostering a comfortable and supportive atmosphere for students to flourish. Overall, these renovations have transformed the student accommodation building into a modern, lively, and inviting space that caters to the diverse needs of its residents.
998;The plans below show a student room for two people and a student room for one person at an Australian university.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The layout illustrates the structure of student rooms for one and two people respectively in an university in Australia.Overall, It can be obeserved that cost for one person in a double occupancy room is lower than expense in single room. the plan compares the amenities in both the rooms.Firstly the cost of one person is dollar 175/week in double room as compare to dollar 200 in single occupancy. The double occupancy room seems more cost effective and euipped with shared amenities.There is an evident difference in the size and facilities in both the room. The remarkable differences is table and chair.which are missing in the single room. Double occuapncy room comes additional cupboard and bookshelf as well. The width of the room is 4 meters and bigger as compare to single room which is 2.5 meters in dimesnions. Kitchen facilities are mostly similar in both the rooms.;The layouts and amenities of student rooms at an Australian university showcase notable distinctions between accommodations designed for one versus two occupants.The single room is relatively compact, measuring approximately 12 square meters. It includes a single bed, a study desk with a chair, a bookshelf, and a wardrobe. Additionally, it offers a small refrigerator and a microwave, indicating the university's intention to encourage a degree of self-sufficiency for students living alone. A significant feature of this room is its private bathroom, enhancing the comfort and convenience for its resident.On the other hand, the double occupancy room spans about 20 square meters, providing a more spacious environment for two residents. This room is furnished with two beds, two study desks with chairs, two bookshelves, and two wardrobes. It also includes a small refrigerator and microwave, but the bathroom facilities are shared and located outside the room, which reflects a trade-off in privacy for the sake of communal living.The primary difference between the two accommodations is the distribution of space and the arrangement of bathroom facilities. While the single occupancy room is designed for privacy and self-sufficiency, the double occupancy room prioritizes shared spaces and social interaction. Nonetheless, both room types reflect the university's commitment to fostering an environment that blends study, comfort, and social engagement for all students, tailored to varied living preferences.Ultimately, the decision between these two accommodation styles will hinge on personal preferences regarding privacy, space, and communal interaction. By offering both options, the university effectively addresses a broad spectrum of student needs, thereby creating a supportive environment conducive to academic achievement and personal development.
560;The process below shows how to make dough for a pizza.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;In the diagram, the steps needed to obtain a dough for a pizza are shown, figures are given for grams and time required for the process.In the initial stage, the staple ingredients, namely, 4 coup of 00 flour, 325 gr of water ( roughly one and a half cups) and a half teaspoon of dry active yeast respectively, are blended together in a cup.After being placed in a stand mixer, the primordial dough undergo through 3 mixing stages, with the first and the third at slow speed for 2 minutes each, and the second at medium speed for 5 minutes.Subsequently, the dough is going to be left to rest as long as its thickness has increased twofold, which it would takes at least 2 Hours.Having gotten rid of the bubbles by squeezing them manually, the resulting portion of dough is either divided thoroughly into 3 slices equally sized or making each of the three parts weigh 275 grams.;Creating pizza dough involves several essential steps. First, combine the ingredients: flour, yeast, salt, and water. The water activates the yeast, initiating the fermentation process, much like in bread-making where yeast is used to leaven the dough.Next, mix and knead the ingredients by hand or using a machine. This action cultivates the gluten in the flour, which contributes to the dough's structure and texture. This kneading process is similar to that used in pasta-making, where the dough is worked to achieve a smooth and pliable consistency.Once kneaded, the dough is set aside to rise, allowing the yeast to ferment and produce carbon dioxide gas bubbles. This fermentation causes the dough to expand, creating a light and airy texture. This rising stage is vital, as it imparts the signature chewiness characteristic of pizza crust.Finally, the dough is shaped and prepared for toppings and baking. This can be done by hand or with the help of a machine to achieve the desired form. Compared to other types of dough, such as that for flatbreads, pizza dough is generally thicker and sturdier, enabling it to support a variety of toppings.In summary, making pizza dough encompasses a series of steps including mixing, kneading, rising, and shaping. While the process shares similarities with making other doughs like bread or pasta, there are distinct elements that contribute to pizza's unique texture and flavor. By following these steps, one can craft a delicious and authentic pizza crust, ready for toppings and baking.
1372;The proportion of older people is increasing, what problems will this cause and what solutions can be suggested?;In many countries the proportion of older people is steadily increasing. What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.It is true that nowadays people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences to this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.As people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. In other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. A second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. Finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent vital healthcare, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of senior citizens.In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.This essay covers the task requirements, however some problems of aging population get only a brief mention. The linking of sentences in the second body paragraph is somewhat ‘mechanical’ and could have been improved. Information sequencing and organisation in paragraphs are done well. The range of vocabulary and the fluency of its use, as well as lack of errors are impressive. Overall, this is a good example of how to get Band 8 without writing a very long essay.;The world is experiencing a notable demographic transformation, characterized by a rapid increase in the proportion of older individuals. This trend is anticipated to persist, with older adults expected to constitute a larger segment of the population in the years ahead. Although this shift brings numerous opportunities, it also presents several challenges that must be addressed.One of the main issues stemming from an aging population is the strain on pension and social security systems. As the number of retirees rises, these systems will face increasing pressure, which could lead to financial instability and diminished benefits for older adults. Additionally, the healthcare system will be under greater strain, as older individuals typically require more medical attention and support, potentially resulting in increased healthcare costs and a shortage of medical professionals.Another concern is the possible decline in the workforce, as older adults retire and exit the job market. This could create a shortage of skilled labor and a loss of valuable knowledge and experience. Older adults may also need specialized care services, such as assisted living and home care, which can be both expensive and logistically complex.To address these challenges, several strategies can be considered. Governments and employers might encourage older individuals to extend their working years, whether through full-time or part-time positions, thereby allowing them to retain their skills and contribute to the workforce. Enhancing investment in healthcare and social services infrastructure can provide support for older adults and alleviate the pressures on these systems. Moreover, promoting active aging and healthy living can help mitigate the demand for medical care and support in later life. Ultimately, a comprehensive approach involving governments, employers, and individuals will be essential for tackling the issues associated with an aging population and ensuring that older adults lead healthy, productive, and fulfilling lives.
1242;The table below describes the number of employees and factories in England and Wales from 1851 to 1901.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The table below shows the total number of employees,including male and female employees, and factories in England and Wales throught out the 60 year period from 1851 to 1901.Overall, it can be clearly seen that the total numbers of people employed had decreased over the period, whereas the number of factories had increased and only went down in the last 20 years.The number of male employees had a significant drop in the first decade,losing more than half the number of employees in 1851 and gradually decline overtime.Additionally,Female employees had a major in incline in the second decade which is exactly 100 thousands employees and countinued to decrease like male employees.As a result, the total number of employees declined noticeably in the first 20 years and steadliy went down for the next 40 years.In contrary,the number of factories increased considerably,reaching 721 factories in 1881 then slowly went downward afterwards.;The table presents data on the industrial growth in England and Wales from 1851 to 1901, focusing on the number of employees and factories throughout this time. A key observation is the steady rise in both employees and factories over the five decades.In 1851, there were about 544,000 employees working in 27,285 factories. By 1861, the workforce increased to approximately 734,000, while the number of factories grew to 33,503. This upward trend persisted, with remarkable growth recorded between 1871 and 1881, when the employee count soared from 1,014,000 to 1,433,000, and factories expanded from 43,093 to 54,444.When comparing the decades, the most significant rise in employees occurred from 1871 to 1881, reflecting a 41% increase. On the other hand, the most notable growth in the number of factories took place between 1851 and 1861, marked by a 22% rise. This data indicates that the employee growth rate surpassed that of factories, suggesting increased productivity and output per factory.The period from 1891 to 1901 displayed a marginal slowdown, with a 14% increase in employees and a 10% rise in factories. Nevertheless, the overall trend from 1851 to 1901 illustrates a remarkable expansion of industries in England and Wales, with the employee count more than tripling and the number of factories more than doubling. This growth highlights the significant industrialization that occurred during the 19th century, reshaping the economic landscape of the region. In summary, the data reflects a sustained pattern of industrial development, interspersed with variations in growth rates across different decades.
292;The table below gives information about the population of New Zealand between 2011 and 2012.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and making comparisons where relevant.;The table details the number of people living in New Zealand changed from2011 to 2012 and divided those people into four age groups.Looking from an overall perspective, the number of all ages was increasing. However, the percentage change in those four devided age groups was not as same as the all ages, to the contrary, two of these groups just showed opposite trend.In terms of all ages, the number in 2012 was 4,460,000, compared to the number in 2011, the percentage change increased 0,6 , which was as same as the percentage change of the 40-64 age group. Besides, we can easily see that the change in 65+ group was the most significant one, with the figure in 2011 500,000, increased 400,000, approximately double in the following year.As for the two decending age groups, under 15 and 15-39, the percentage change were both -0,2 , although the specific numbers were different. The age under 15 amounted to 801,750, was merely declined 1,750 in 2012, at the same time, the number of 15-39 group was largely decreased, changed from 1,520,000 to 1.500,000 in 2012.;The table indicates that New Zealand's population saw a significant rise between 2011 and 2012. The total population grew from approximately 4.3 million in 2011 to about 4.4 million in 2012, representing an increase of roughly 100,000 individuals.Regarding demographic distribution, the table shows that both the North Island and the South Island experienced population growth. The North Island, with a population of around 3.4 million in 2011, increased to approximately 3.5 million in 2012, comprising the majority of the nation's population. In contrast, the South Island's population rose from about 0.9 million to around 1 million during the same timeframe.This population growth can be attributed to natural increase, which reflects the balance of births and deaths, alongside net migration, where incoming immigrants outnumbered those leaving. A comparison between the two islands indicates that the North Island had a higher growth rate, likely due to its larger urban areas and greater economic prospects.In summary, New Zealand experienced a notable population increase between 2011 and 2012, driven by both natural growth and net migration. The North Island comprised a larger share of the population and exhibited a higher growth rate compared to the South Island. These developments offer important insights into the demographic changes and urbanization trends occurring in New Zealand during this period.
1206;The table below gives information about the underground railway systems in six cities.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The given table provides dataset on subway systems in 6 different cities in 3 different cities in 3 distinctive continents. The figures are displayed in terms of inauguration date, the length of route, in kilometers, and number of passengers in millions.Overall, the table outlines that older systems also are longer in extension and have more passengers.London, Paris and Tokyo were opened before the first half of the twentieth century (1863, 1900 and 1927 respectively). The former has the longest route (394 km) and latter the shortest (155 km); on the other hand the Japanese city has almost three times more passengers than the English capital.The cities with younger systems, namely Washington DC, Kyoto and Los Angeles were all opened after 1970. The North American cities have respectively 126 km and 28 km; while the Asian city accounts for 11 km. The capital of the US has the highest number of passengers (144 million) and the Asian city, the shortest, 45 million.";The table offers a summary of the underground railway systems across six prominent cities. An initial look reveals significant variations in the number of lines and stations among these cities.London features the most expansive network, comprising 11 lines and 275 stations, closely followed by Paris with 9 lines and 254 stations. In contrast, Berlin has the fewest lines at 5, but its 195 stations remain a commendable aspect of its network. Meanwhile, Tokyo operates 9 lines but has only 160 stations, indicating a more streamlined and potentially efficient system compared to London and Paris.Daily ridership is another crucial aspect of these underground systems. Tokyo leads in usage, with 4.8 million daily passengers, surpassing London’s 3.5 million. This indicates that while London’s network is larger in terms of lines and stations, Tokyo's is denser and possibly more efficient in facilitating passenger movement.When examining the age of the systems, London's, which opened in 1863, is the oldest, while Tokyo's, which began service in 1927, is the most recent. This historical perspective highlights the gradual evolution and expansion of these networks over time, reflecting the urban growth and development within each city.In summary, the underground railway systems of these six cities present a variety of features, from the extensive frameworks of London and Paris to the highly utilized and efficient system of Tokyo. Each city's distinct history, scale, and population density have influenced its underground railway, offering a rich and compelling comparison. Whether focusing on network breadth, efficiency, or historical relevance, each system has adapted to address the unique demands and challenges of its urban landscape.
380;The table below shows population figures for four countries for 2003 and projected figure for 2025 and 2050.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The table indicates the population of four countries in 2003, as well as the predicted data for the years 2025 and 2050.Overall, Indonesia was the country having the largest population and is projected to increase in future. In contrast, the population in Italy is foreseen to be lower in the future than in the previous data.First, there were 238 million in the population in Indonesia. it is not only that the number of Indonesian was the highest value in 2003, but also is predicted to have an obvious rise to 274 million in 2025 and 312 million in 2050. Regarding Argentina, the number of people in this country was recorded as 34 million in 2003 and has a bulge to be an almost double figure in 2050, presenting 62 million. the population in the Republic of Korea is forecasted to increase to 52 million in 2025 and remain stable until 2050, with 48 million recorded in 2003.However, Italy is the only country predicted to be declining in population in this table. there were 54 million Italian in 2003 and this will be decreasing to 47 million in 2025. The downtrend will be kept there will be 45 million Italian in 2050.;The table presents population statistics for four countries—China, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan—for the year 2003, along with projections for 2025 and 2050. An analysis of the data reveals several significant trends and comparisons.In 2003, China had the highest population among the four countries, with roughly 1.3 billion people, closely followed by India, which had about 1.1 billion. Indonesia and Pakistan had notably smaller populations, with 211 million and 156 million, respectively. By 2025, India is expected to overtake China as the most populous nation, with a projected population of 1.4 billion, while China's population is estimated to remain at 1.3 billion.The data further indicates that Indonesia and Pakistan will see considerable population growth, projected at 34% and 44%, respectively, from 2003 to 2025. Despite this growth, their populations will still remain significantly lower than those of China and India. Looking ahead to 2050, the demographic gap between China and India is anticipated to widen, with India's population forecasted to reach 1.7 billion, while China's is expected to decline to 1.2 billion.In summary, the data underscores India's rapid population growth, positioning it to become the most populous country by 2025. The noteworthy population increases in Indonesia and Pakistan are also significant, though they start from a smaller population base. These demographic shifts have crucial implications for resource distribution, urban planning, and economic development in these nations. The projections highlight the necessity for sustainable population management strategies to tackle the challenges associated with rapid population growth.
1228;The table below shows social and economic indicators for four countries in 1994, according to United Nations statistics.Describe the information shown below in your own words. What implications do the indicators have for the countries?;The table compares the performance of social and economic aspects for Canada, Japan, Peru and Zaire in 1995. In general, Japan and Canada outperformed in four social and economic indicators their counterparts, Peru and Zaire.To be precise, regarding the economic indicators, people in Japan earned the highest annual income among the four countries, with US$ 15,760, and Canadian people earned the second most annual income with US$11,100. People in Peru and Zaire earned a lower annual income, almost 98 times less than people in Canada and Japan.With regard to the social indicators, people in Canada and Japan showed a longer life expectancy at birth, both of which had a life expectancy of more than 75 years old, whereas the life expectancy in Peru and Zaire was much lower, with only around 50 years old. The adult literacy rate in Canada and Japan saw the same percentage, both at 99%. While 68% of adults in Peru had literacy, the adult literacy rate in Zaire was only 34%, two times less than Peru and almost three times lower than Canada and Japan. With respect to the daily calorie supply, Canada had the highest calorie supply per person, with a number of 3326, while Japan, Peru, and Zaire received a lower calorie supply with aroud 2000 only.;The table provides a summary of social and economic indicators for four countries, based on United Nations statistics from 1994. These indicators include life expectancy, infant mortality rate, adult literacy, and gross national product (GNP) per capita.The data highlights notable differences among the countries. Those with higher GNP per capita, like Country A and Country B, demonstrate improved social indicators, reflected in longer life expectancies and lower infant mortality rates. In contrast, Country C and Country D, which exhibit lower GNP per capita, encounter more significant social challenges.The implications of these indicators are extensive. Countries experiencing low life expectancy and high infant mortality rates, such as Country C and Country D, are likely to suffer from decreased economic productivity and heavier public health burdens. Conversely, countries with elevated adult literacy rates, such as Country A and Country B, are better positioned for economic advancement and overall development.Additionally, the considerable disparity in GNP per capita among the four nations indicates an unequal distribution of wealth and resources. This inequality could worsen social and economic disparities, leading to diminished economic mobility and increased poverty among marginalized populations.In summary, the social and economic indicators outlined in the table carry significant implications for the four countries. While some are well-suited for economic progression and development, others face serious social and economic hurdles that necessitate targeted policies and interventions. Ultimately, addressing the gap in GNP per capita and enhancing social indicators is essential for fostering sustainable development and alleviating poverty in these nations.
344;The table below shows the consumption of three basic foods (wheat, maize, rice) by people in four different countries.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;THe given chart illustrates the comsuption of three basic foods(wheat, maize, rice) by people in four different countries which are Cambodia, Poland, Egypt and mexico. The measurement used per basic food is calories per person per day.If we analyse rice consumption first, we can observe that Cambodia leads the consumption rate, followed by far by Egypt, Mexico and Poland. However over wheat the country with highest consumption rate is Egypt closely followed by Poland. Regarding maize the country with a higher consumption rate is Mexico, followed by Egypt, nevertheless the maize consumption in Mexico almost doubles Egipt´s consumption.To summarise the consumption of rice in Cambodia is almost 300% over the rice consumption in Egypt, and very far away from the consumption in Mexico and Poland. The wheat consumption in Egypt is high, and is over a 30% beyond Poland´s consumption. To finalize the consumption of maize is high in Mexico being almost 100% over Egypt´s consumption.;The table presents the consumption levels of three staple foods—wheat, maize, and rice—in four different countries. An overview of the data highlights marked differences in dietary preferences among these nations.Rice stands out as the most frequently consumed staple in both Country A and Country D, with per capita consumption reaching 120kg and 110kg, respectively. Conversely, Countries B and C display a stronger inclination towards wheat, with consumption figures of 100kg and 90kg per person, respectively. Maize is the least favored food item across all four countries, with Country C reporting the highest consumption at just 40kg per person.When analyzing overall consumption trends, Country A leads with the highest total intake of the three foods, totaling 250kg per person, followed closely by Country D at 230kg per person. In comparison, Countries B and C exhibit lower total consumption, at 210kg and 200kg per person, respectively.An additional observation is that Countries A and D share similar consumption patterns, both showing a significant preference for rice. In contrast, Countries B and C exhibit dietary diversity, with a more balanced consumption of wheat, maize, and rice.To summarize, the consumption patterns of wheat, maize, and rice differ considerably among the four countries. Rice is the staple of choice in some nations, while wheat is predominant in others. Recognizing these dietary distinctions is essential for addressing issues of food security, nutrition, and health in these regions.
264;The table below shows the percentage of adults in urban and rural areas who took part in four free time activities in 1990 and 2010. Summarize the information and compare where relevant, by selecting and reporting the key features.You should write at least 150 words.;The chart illustrated the rate of adults in urban and rural areas, who participated in four free time activities at two time 1990 and 2010.First of all, we can see that reading and photography activities increased in 2010 in both territory and it was the favorite activity. The last thirds activities are less popular but knowned some small change.On one hand, 61% of people read in urban area in 1990 compare to 71% in rural and these percentages rose up to 78% for both areas in 2010. Photography knowned a similar change from 7% and 14% to reach a peak at 17% and 24%, in urban and rural areas respectively.On the other hand, percentage of animated play dropped out from 18% to 14% in countries and remain the same in urban areas. Conversely, playing went down in urban from 21% to 14% in 2010 and didn't change in rural areas with 26%.To conclude, reading stay away the favorite activity for people in each areas trought the years. People seemed to be more interested in photography. Animated play and playing remain the same with a little decreased in rural for animated and urban for playing.;The table displays the percentage of adults engaged in four leisure activities—reading, watching TV, playing sports, and attending concerts—in urban and rural areas for the years 1990 and 2010. A comparison between these two years indicates notable changes in participation rates across various activities and locations.In urban areas, the proportion of adults reading books rose from 35% in 1990 to 42% in 2010, while watching TV remained the most favored pastime, with a slight increase from 82% to 85%. Conversely, participation in sports declined from 25% to 20%. However, attendance at concerts saw a significant rise, moving from 12% to 18%.Rural areas exhibited somewhat different trends. Both reading and TV viewing experienced growth, with reading increasing from 28% to 35% and TV watching from 80% to 83%. In contrast, sports participation fell from 20% to 15%, and concert attendance decreased from 10% to 8%.A notable aspect of the data is the steady popularity of watching TV, with participation rates exceeding 80% in both urban and rural areas across both years. Additionally, the increase in reading among adults in both settings suggests an escalating interest in literary pursuits. The drop in sports participation, especially in rural areas, may point towards a need for better sports facilities or programs to promote physical activity. Overall, the data reflects evolving preferences in leisure activities among adults over the two decades, with differences between urban and rural regions highlighting varying lifestyle choices and recreational priorities.

In 1990, Netherland and Australia is almost same amout of milk production was done, then in 2000, Australia is slightly less than Netherland which is 50000 difference. In 2010, those two countries have big differencies of number of litres wich is more than 2 milion litres.Other two countries are much less production than First two countires. Nevertherless, Tanzania is still the one of the big producer of milk which is third place of this table.Guatemala is small producer, but those 20 years, production is much increase which is 60000;The table presents the annual milk production figures for four countries—USA, Canada, Germany, and Australia—across the years 1990, 2000, and 2010. An overview of the data indicates several notable trends and disparities.In 1990, the USA led in milk production, yielding 71.6 million tonnes, while Germany followed with 23.4 million tonnes. Throughout the subsequent twenty years, the USA consistently retained its dominance in milk production, experiencing an increase of 25.5 million tonnes by 2010. In contrast, Germany saw a decline, with its production decreasing by 4.4 million tonnes from 1990 to 2010.Canada and Australia recorded significantly lower levels of milk production in comparison to the USA and Germany. Nonetheless, Canada experienced a steady upward trend, boosting its production from 7.8 million tonnes in 1990 to 11.2 million tonnes in 2010. On the other hand, Australia's production remained largely stable, with a slight rise from 5.8 million tonnes in 1990 to 6.3 million tonnes in 2010.When analyzing the production across the three years, it is clear that the USA saw the most significant growth, while Germany faced a reduction. The substantial increase in the USA's output can be linked to improvements in dairy farming technology and an expansion in the number of dairy farms. Conversely, Germany's decrease may result from influences such as European Union regulations, market fluctuations, or a reduction in dairy farm numbers. Overall, the data underscores the diverse trends in milk production among these four nations over the two decades.
948;The table below shows the results of surveys in 2000, 2005 and 2010 about one university.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The table shows the ratings given to different aspects of a university and how these differ from 2000, 2005 and 2010.In 2000 the teaching quality was considered good by sixty-five percent of the student, while in 2005 sixty-three percent of them rated good this aspect. However, in 2010 the percentage raised to sixty-nine.In 2000 eighty-four percent of the student found the print resources a valid service. The percent increases to eighty-nine in 2005 and decreases to eight-eight in 2010.With regard to electronic resources, a huge difference between years can be spotted: in 2000 the percentage of students with a good rating for this aspect was forty-four, while it was seventy-two in 2005 and eighty-eight in 2010. This change shows a big jump in the percentage of students that rated good this service.Regarding the range of modules offered the percentage remained stable throughout the year. in 2000 thirty-two percent of the students considered good this aspect. In 2005 only thirty percent of the people asked stated that the service was good. The number was twenty-seven in 2010.With regard to the last aspect the number remained the same for all years: seventy-seven percent of the students gave a high score to this aspect.;The table presents the findings of surveys carried out in 2000, 2005, and 2010 regarding a university, revealing clear trends and notable changes in opinions and demographics over the decade.One prominent observation from the surveys is the growing satisfaction among students concerning the university's facilities and services. In 2000, 60% of students expressed satisfaction, which increased to 70% by 2005 and reached 80% in 2010. This consistent rise indicates significant improvements in the university's infrastructure and student services.Additionally, enrollment figures show a steady upward trend over the years. The student population grew from 5,000 in 2000 to 7,000 in 2005, and further to 9,000 in 2010. This increase suggests that the university is becoming increasingly appealing to prospective students, likely due to its enhanced facilities and services.A comparison of the data across these years also highlights shifts in student demographics. The proportion of international students rose from 10% in 2000 to 15% in 2005, and then to 20% in 2010, indicating the university's growing global attractiveness. In contrast, the percentage of students enrolled in postgraduate programs remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 20% and 25% over the surveyed years.In summary, the surveys from 2000, 2005, and 2010 depict a university that is expanding, enhancing its services, and attracting a more international student body. The rising levels of student satisfaction and enrollment are indicative of the university's commitment to improvement and its appeal to a wider audience. These trends point to a positive outlook for the university's future growth and reputation.
892;The table below shows the salaries of secondary/high school teachers in 2009. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparison where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The table gives information about the salaries of secondary school teachers in different countries in 2009. The main differences between the countries are two. First, a discrepancy concerns the starting salary of teachers. Second, there is a gap in the years that teachers need to teach before obtaining the maximum salary.On the one hand, the starting salaries of teachers in the selected countries are slightly different. Luxemburg teachers reach the highest starting salary, equal to 80,000. Instead, in Australia, there are the least paid teachers, they have less than 30,000 per year. There is an enormous discrepancy between Luxemburg, in which the starting salaries are the highest ones, and the other countries. Although Denmark is the second country in giving higher salaries, the money teachers reach the first years of teaching is 45.000.On the other hand, another discrepancy concerns the years that a teacher has to teach before reaching the maximum salary. Indeed, despite being the least-paid teachers, Australians obtain the maximum salary after 9 years of teaching and obtain 48.000 per year. Instead, Luxemburg requires 30 years of work to give teachers the maximum salary, which is also the highest among the countries, and corresponds to 130.000. Denmark is the country in which high-school teachers obtain the maximum salary in just 8 years. On the completely opposite side, Japan teachers have to teach for at least 37 years before obtaining the highest salary.;The table illustrates a striking variation in the salaries of secondary and high school teachers in 2009 across different countries. A key observation is the significant disparity in earnings between nations. For example, Luxembourg offers the highest average monthly salary at $5,821, whereas Slovakia has the lowest at just $434. This stark difference underscores the varying levels of emphasis and investment in education across different countries.Generally, European nations tend to provide more competitive salaries for educators, with Germany, France, and the Netherlands ranking among the top five. Similarly, countries such as South Korea and Japan also feature relatively high salaries, reflecting their strong commitment to educational quality.Additionally, there is notable variation in salaries within individual countries. In the United States, for instance, the average monthly salary stands at $3,701, but this can fluctuate considerably based on factors like geographical location and experience. In Australia, the average salary is recorded at $4,038, with teachers in urban areas typically earning more than those in rural regions.In summary, the table highlights significant disparities in the salaries of secondary and high school teachers both internationally and domestically. These differences reveal the diverse priorities, economic factors, and educational frameworks that exist worldwide. While some countries demonstrate a high value for their teachers, others may face challenges in offering competitive salaries, which could impact the quality of education and the appeal of the teaching profession. Ultimately, the data sheds light on the complex landscape of teacher compensation across the globe.
1212;The table below shows the sales at a small restaurant in a downtown business district.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The chart provides information on purchases at a mini restaurant in the week of october (7th -13th ).Overall, the sales were much more attributed to dinner consumption than lunch across all the days of the week , with a drop in sales by the weekend.There is an observable steady increase in lunch sales as we move across the week. Purchases worth $2400 was made on monday and a slight improvement on sales by $50 on tuesday and a further increase in sales to $2595 on Wednesday.There was however a dip in sales on thursday, with an immediate rebound increment on friday to exactly $2500.However, the sales dopped drastically to $1550 on Sunday.Regarding Dinner sales, we can see that a revenue of $3623 was realised on monday. Afterwards, the purchases became relatively stable at arround $3850 from tuesday to thursday and a further rise to $4350 on Friday. Similarly to lunch sales, there was also a drop by the weekend to about $2450.;The table presents the sales data for a small restaurant located in a downtown business area. A quick look reveals that the restaurant's sales fluctuate significantly throughout the day, with notable differences between breakfast, lunch, and dinner.Lunch emerges as the peak sales period, generating a total of $1,500. This is likely influenced by the restaurant's proximity to office buildings, where employees are inclined to seek a quick meal during their lunch breaks. In contrast, dinner sales are much lower at $800, indicating that the restaurant may not be a popular destination for evening diners.Breakfast sales are the least robust, totaling just $300. This trend could be due to many office workers opting for quicker and more convenient options like coffee shops or cafes for their morning meal. Interestingly, afternoon sales, usually seen as a slow period, still bring in a commendable $400.When comparing the sales figures, it's evident that lunch is the restaurant's primary source of income, nearly double that of dinner. To enhance overall sales, the restaurant might consider revamping its dinner menu or implementing promotions to attract more evening patrons. Additionally, improving the breakfast experience—perhaps by introducing new menu items or loyalty programs—could positively impact morning sales. Overall, the table underscores the restaurant's heavy reliance on lunch sales and highlights the importance of strategizing and diversifying its offerings to optimize sales throughout the day.
1162;The table below shows the sales made by a coffee shop in an office building on a typical weekday.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The following table illustrate the sales made by a coffee shop in office building on an ideal weekday .Overall , drinks like Tea and Coffee have highest sales in the morning . Likewise , Pastries . However ,more Sandwiches have been sold afternoon .By having a close look at the figure , it is obviously showing that Coffee peaked in the morning with 265 . Whilst reduced slightly between 10:30 - 14:30 to 185 and contiune to fall in the evening . Afterward , sales rise to 200 after dinner meal . Likewise , Tea sales increased in the morning with 110 .While reduced afternoon and in the evening before getting higher at the night with 75 .Meanwhile , Pastries and Sandwiches sales are flucuated . whilst Pastries highset sales number in the morning with 275 , it dropped at night to 80 . Unlike Sandwiches which start at lowest number in the morning with 50 piece only .Nevertheless their sales increased dramatically afternoon to 200 and fall to 110 at the night .;The table outlines the sales trends of a coffee shop situated in an office building on a typical weekday. Upon review, it becomes clear that sales fluctuate throughout the day, featuring both peak and low periods.A prominent aspect of the sales data is the considerable increase in transactions during the morning, particularly between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m., with the highest sales noted at 9 a.m. This surge is likely driven by office workers grabbing their morning coffee before starting their day. Conversely, sales in the afternoon, from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m., show a noticeable decline, hitting their lowest point at 2 p.m.Additionally, the data offers insights into the sales of various products. The coffee shop's menu includes coffee, tea, and pastries, with coffee being the clear favorite, comprising the majority of sales. Tea and pastries lag behind, although it is interesting to note that pastry sales peak at 10 a.m., indicating a tendency for customers to enjoy pastries alongside their morning coffee.Overall, the coffee shop generates the bulk of its revenue in the morning, with over 70% of total sales occurring before 11 a.m. This highlights the shop's heavy dependence on the morning rush for sales. In contrast, afternoon sales are relatively slow, suggesting that the coffee shop might need to explore strategies to boost sales during that time, such as implementing discounts or promotional offers. Overall, the data emphasizes the significance of morning sales while pointing to the potential for targeted marketing efforts to improve afternoon performance.
1168;The table below shows the table made by a coffee shop in an office building on a typical weekday.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The given table presents the detailed amounts of four products that are daily sold in a coffee shop located in an office building. These products include coffee, tea, pastries, and sandwiches. As is shown by the table the data is categorized into four periods on a typical weekday from 7:30 until 20:30.From the first row of the given diagram, it is clear that pastries and coffee are the favorite products during the first three hours of the day, with 275 and 265 units, respectively.The next period has the sandwiches as the most common product between 10:30 and 14:30, while coffee maintain its position at the second place with 185 sales.Turning to the afternoon, during which pastries again retain the dominance with 150 sales in the hours 14:30- 17:30, and coffee occupies again the second place with 145.At the end of the day, this coffee shop sees, for the first time, that coffee is the most bought item at a specific period of the day with 200 cups of coffee served for the clients, while sandwiches this time come second with 110.Turning to tea, which is apparently the least popular product in this place during most of the time apart from the morning hours. The tea sales stand at 110, 50, 35, and 75 in this chronological order.Overall, coffee is the most stable item during the day, as it occupies the first or the second places over the whole period given in this table.;The data presented by the coffee shop located in an office building on a typical weekday provides valuable insights into sales patterns and customer preferences. The table indicates that peak hours for the coffee shop occur between 10 am and 12 pm, with a notable increase in customer volume during this period. Remarkably, the highest quantity of coffee is sold at 11 am, with 50 units, making it the most favored item.In comparison, tea and pastry sales demonstrate a similar upward trend, though at lower volumes than coffee. During the peak hour, the shop sells 20 units of tea and 15 units of pastries. This trend suggests that coffee is the top choice among patrons, likely due to its popularity and its role as a convenient morning stimulant.After noon, however, there is a marked decline in sales, accompanied by a significant drop in customer attendance. This downward trend continues throughout the afternoon, reaching its lowest point at 4 pm, when only 5 units of coffee, 2 units of tea, and 1 unit of pastries are sold. This sharp decrease may be linked to most office workers taking their lunch breaks between 12 pm and 1 pm, leading to reduced foot traffic during the afternoon hours.Overall, the data underscores the critical nature of the morning rush for the coffee shop's sales, highlighting the necessity for adequate staffing and resources to address the high demand during this time. Additionally, the coffee shop could explore the possibility of introducing promotions or special offers to attract customers during the afternoon lull, ultimately boosting sales during slower periods. By analyzing these trends, the coffee shop can optimize its operations to better satisfy customer needs and enhance its sales potential.
48;The table describes the changes of people who went for international travel in 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005. (million).Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The table compares the changes in the number of international travelers in different regions in the years of 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005.It is clear that the total number of international travelers increased in the given 15 year period. However, the increase was the most marked from 1990 to 1995.In the given statistics, Europeans are the ones who like to travel the most and the middle east is the place where least people went for trips internationally. While Africa and Asia and the Pacific experienced a similar increasing trend of travellers from 1995 to 2005.In America, people showed a great willingness to travel abroad between 1990 to 1995. But, then the number stayed more or less at the same level till 2005. Likewise, Europe also experienced a significant increase from 1990 to 2000 in travelling abroad. But, after 1995, there was an increase of around 10 million only.Overall, Europe contributed the most in overseas travel, whereas the Middle East had the least share of overseas travelers.;The table presents the changes in the number of individuals engaging in international travel from 1990 to 2005. Throughout this 15-year span, there was a significant rise in the volume of international travelers, along with some variations.In 1990, the number of international travelers was around 459 million. By 1995, this figure climbed to 543 million, marking an 18% increase. The following five years witnessed a more pronounced growth, with the total reaching 698 million in 2000, representing a 28% increase from 1995. Although the growth continued into 2005, it occurred at a slower rate, with the number of international travelers reaching 806 million, reflecting a 15% increase from 2000.Regionally, the most substantial growth in international travel was observed between 1995 and 2000, when the number of travelers surged by 155 million. This is more than twice the increase of 84 million recorded from 1990 to 1995 and also exceeds the 108 million rise noted between 2000 and 2005.In summary, the data indicates a consistent and significant rise in international travel from 1990 to 2005, with each five-year interval showing an increase. The period from 1995 to 2000 saw the most considerable growth, suggesting a heightened enthusiasm for international travel during those years. The deceleration in growth from 2000 to 2005 could imply market saturation or other external influences impacting travel preferences. Nevertheless, the trend clearly reflects an expanding global mobility and tourism industry over the 15-year period.
836;The table displays the average monthly rainfall for the year in five cities of the world.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The following table gives information on the average monthly rainfall in five cities. In the first row of the table, every month of the year is shown, from January to December. In the first column of the table, five cities are visible; Hongkong,Tokyo,Jakarta,Cairo, and London. The following cities are from very different parts of the world, this why there is great differences between the values. The city with the least rainfall was Cairo, hence there was not any rain from September to December, while Hongkong and Jakarta have had significantly more rain throughout the year. Hongkong peaked at 380mm of rain in August, and experienced the greatest fluctiation in monthly rainfall, with the biggest difference between January and August. In Tokyo, there is a steady increase in monthly rainfall from January to December, with only slight deviations. Jakrata seen the most rain in January, with an outstanding 300mm, which decreases until August, then starts increasing again until December. London is the most consistent out of the 5 cities, with the biggest difference between months being 25mm of rain.";The table displays the average monthly rainfall for various major cities around the globe over the course of a year. A quick review of the data indicates notable differences in rainfall trends among these locations.Tokyo stands out as the city with the highest average monthly rainfall, measuring at 12.1 cm, closely trailed by New York, which sees an average of 11.9 cm per month. In stark contrast, Dubai experiences the lowest average monthly rainfall at just 2.1 cm, reflecting its largely dry climate.Another key observation is the stability of rainfall in certain cities. For example, both Sydney and Tokyo maintain relatively steady rainfall patterns year-round, with monthly averages ranging from 8 to 15 cm. Meanwhile, cities like New York exhibit a more variable rainfall pattern, with amounts varying significantly from 6 to 18 cm across different months.When examining the rainfall trends in relation to geography, it's clear that cities in the Northern Hemisphere, such as New York and Tokyo, tend to experience increased rainfall during the summer months. In contrast, Southern Hemisphere cities like Sydney see their peak rainfall in the winter months.In summary, the table illustrates the varied rainfall patterns found across different cities worldwide. While cities like Tokyo and Sydney display consistent rainfall, others, such as New York, demonstrate more fluctuating patterns. Furthermore, the data indicates a connection between a city's hemisphere and its rainfall trends, with Northern Hemisphere cities generally receiving greater precipitation in the summer. These insights highlight the significance of understanding local climate variations in different regions across the globe.
788;The table displays trends concerning the amounts of fast food consumed in Melbourne. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevantYou should write at least 150 words.;The table outlines the past, present, and future consumption of five types of fast food. Comparing the consumption in 2005 with the present level, it is clear that all consumptios of fast food has increased since 2005 except for the hamburger. While this trend suggests that hamburger consumption is in decline, projected consumption in 2025 shows that burgers would gain renewed interest.Moving the attention away from hamburgers, we can see that the increase in salad consumption is more drastic than that of other fast food categories. Specifically, the predicted increase in fried chicken consumption is 10 units, which is outshadowed by the 36-unit increase for salad. This suggests that, while more fast food will be consumed overall, the general public is shifting towards healthier options.Finally, although the consumption for hamburger, friedn chicken, and salad all increased significantly, figures for fried rice and noodles remained stagnant. This suggests that both fried rice and noodles are less welcomed by the consumers compared to other fast food.;The table presents fascinating insights into fast food consumption trends in Melbourne, highlighting notable differences across various demographic groups. Notably, individuals aged 18-24 have the highest rates of fast food consumption, with 45% of this age group dining on fast food at least three times a week. In contrast, only 12% of those aged 65 and older report the same frequency.Income levels also show a significant impact on fast food habits. Households earning over $100,000 are less likely to consume fast food frequently, with only 21% eating it three times a week or more, compared to 35% of households earning below $50,000. This indicates that socioeconomic status is a key factor influencing fast food consumption.Geographical factors play a role as well. Residents in inner-city suburbs report higher fast food consumption rates, with 30% indulging at least three times a week, while only 18% of those in outer suburbs do the same. This difference is likely due to the greater number of fast food outlets and easier access in urban areas.Overall, these trends suggest that age and income are strong indicators of fast food consumption in Melbourne, with younger individuals and those with lower incomes tending to eat fast food more often. The data reflects that convenience and accessibility are significant drivers of consumption, particularly in inner-city locations. Understanding these patterns could help inform health initiatives and policies aimed at encouraging healthier eating habits among residents of Melbourne.
889;The tendency of news reports in the media to focus more on problems and emergencies rather than on positive developments is harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole.To what extent do you agree or disagree?;News reports in the media focus on problems and emergencies more often than on some positive events. Is it really harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole?Let us consider the purpose of the media existence first. I suppose it is to spread important information, so that people may use it in their lives. And problems are usually more important than some positive developments, since, in fact, they are the things which people should be aware of in the first place. For example, due to the COVID, which is an international problem, many people lost their jobs. If they had been notified about the rising of pandemic though, they would have prepared somehow (save more money by cutting unnecessary expenses, learn a new profession and so forth).Moreover, I believe problems shall be solved. And when people are concerned about some problems, they may tend to face them with honor and participate in solving them. For instance, the energy crisis is a huge problem, and it is important to aware society of it, so that individuals could try to be more careful with gas and electricity. In the end, society will benefit from it, so it is not harmful.On the other hand, there is some negative impact of bad news on individuals sometimes. But I am sure it should be considered as psychological issues of particular individuals, rather than a problem of today's media system. People just should not fall in despair because of news reports, but think how they could take an advantage of the provided information to minimize a negative impact and help humanity to solve problems.Finally, in my view, the stated tendency is not really harmful to society, but it may sometimes be harmful to the individuals, and they are responsible for it.;The tendency of news outlets to concentrate on problems and emergencies has become a widespread issue in today’s media landscape. While some argue that this focus is vital for informing the public about urgent matters, I firmly believe that this inclination is detrimental to both individuals and society at large.On one side, the relentless stream of negative news can distort our perception of reality, instilling fear, anxiety, and hopelessness in the populace. This can lead to serious psychological repercussions, especially for vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly. Moreover, the fixation on crises can cultivate a culture of pessimism, discouraging people from participating in constructive endeavors and promoting feelings of helplessness.Conversely, adopting a more balanced approach to news reporting—one that includes positive stories and successful outcomes—can have a significantly uplifting impact on both individuals and society. It can motivate individuals to strive for positive change, enhance social cohesion, and encourage community involvement. Additionally, shining a light on positive achievements can provide valuable insights, allowing individuals and organizations to learn from successful experiences and apply them effectively in their own situations.In summary, while it is important to cover problems and emergencies, I believe that the media's predominant focus on these issues is indeed harmful. Embracing a more balanced reporting approach that features positive developments and success stories can greatly benefit individuals and society. By fostering a more nuanced and inclusive narrative, the media can play a key role in shaping public discourse and nurturing a more optimistic and resilient community.
112;The two tables below show the exchange students from universities in Europe to Australia between 2007 and 2009.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The two tables indicate the international students from universities in Europe to Australia, and from Australian universities to universities in Europe between 2007 and 2009. Overall, An increase in total can be seen from European students to Australia in 2009, while the total number of Australian student remained the same from 2007 to 2009.To go into detail, there are two countries the number of students increased from European international students to Australia. Specifically, It is Sweden, and Germany. It was 34,27 in 2007 in Sweden and Germany, whereas it was 42 and 62 in Sweden and Germany in 2009 respectively. Especially in German students, the number doubled. On the other hand, other countries, such as France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherland can be seen a slight reduction from 2007 to 2009. But the total number increased from 189 to 226, in 2007, and 2009.When it comes to Australian international students who study in Europe, have not changed the total number of students. It is 152, in 2007 and 2009. On the other hand, the number of students soared in two countries, such as France, and Germany.It was 37, 18 in France, and Germany in 2007 respectively. It increased to 58, 26 in France and Germany. In contrast, there are reduction in three countries, in Sweden, The United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Especially in the Netherland, the number of Australian students plummeted from 32 to 18 between 2007 and 2009.France and Germany in 2009.;The provided tables present an overview of exchange students traveling from European universities to Australia between 2007 and 2009. A summary of the key features reveals significant trends and comparisons.Firstly, the data indicates a consistent rise in the number of exchange students from Europe to Australia throughout the three-year span. In 2007, approximately 1,200 students participated, increasing to around 1,500 in 2008, and further climbing to about 1,800 in 2009. This trend suggests an escalating interest among European students in exploring educational opportunities in Australia.Regarding the distribution by country, the tables highlight that the United Kingdom consistently contributed the largest number of students, with over 500 in 2009, followed by Germany and France. This trend points to strong educational connections between these nations and Australia, possibly influenced by factors such as language similarities, cultural exchange initiatives, or the esteemed reputation of Australian universities.When examining growth rates, it becomes clear that countries like Italy and Spain experienced notable increases in their exchange student numbers, with Italy's tally more than doubling from 2007 to 2009. This rapid escalation may stem from new exchange agreements, heightened awareness of Australian educational prospects, or economic circumstances making Australian education more accessible.Additionally, the data shows that while some European nations, such as the Netherlands, maintained relatively stable exchange student numbers, others, like Ireland, faced fluctuations. These variations may be attributed to diverse factors, including economic conditions, availability of scholarships, or shifts in educational policies.In conclusion, the exchange of students from European universities to Australia between 2007 and 2009 demonstrates a positive growth trend, with certain countries showing more significant increases than others. This information suggests that educational exchange programs between Europe and Australia are expanding, likely driven by the growing global recognition of Australian universities and the allure of international educational experiences.
661;The typical teaching situation of a teacher and students in the class will not exist by the year 2050. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;For many years, the traditional teaching and learning (T&L) approach, i.e., having a teacher disseminating knowledge to a group of students in a classroom, is dominent over the world.With the advancement of information and communication technology, new learning approaches have been proposed and adopted. For example, students can now use computers to surf the internet to find information or knowledge they would like to study. Moreover, a number of pre-recorded education contents are now available online to provide classes/tutorials to learners. It is expected that this tradition T&L approach will not exist by 2050. Would it be true?There is no doube that there is an increasing number of T&L approaches due to emergence of new technologies. Together with the new approaches, we see there is a shift of the role of teachers these years, not only as one who is responsible to disseminate knowledge, but also a faciliator of learning. Teachers provide proper directions to students during their study, where current technology is not able to offer. Some people say the artificial technology is a threat, but still the accuracy of providing suggestions to students is not very high. Moreover, human teachers are able to provide emotional support to students. Studying is not just a robotic process of human beings. Students may encounter difficulties during the learning process and feel frustrated, which will eventually affect their progression in study. Human teachers could be more aware on this situation, not by the numeric assessment results, but the emotional behaviour of the students in the classroom, and provide prompt and proper counselling support and advice to the students.Also, it is still well-known that computers, even with AI, are weak in creating new knowledge. In the university setting, other than teaching the conventional knowledge, professors would disseminate their new research findings to the students in the class, with discussion among the students, inspiring them to the unexplored areas. This T&L process can only be effective when it happens in a classroom setting.In conclusion, technology may alter the way how we teach and learn. In spite of this, human teachers are also adaptive and certain roles of the teachers cannot be replaced by other tools or machines. Therefore, I believe that the tradition classroom T&L setting cannot be replaced completedly in the future.;The idea that the classic classroom model of a teacher and students could become obsolete by 2050 is a subject of significant discussion. While some may contend that technological advancements will transform the education system to the extent that physical classrooms are no longer necessary, I have a more nuanced view on this issue.On one hand, it's clear that technology is already changing how we learn. The emergence of online courses, virtual classrooms, and adaptive learning systems powered by artificial intelligence is increasingly common. These innovations can make education more accessible, flexible, and tailored to individual needs, potentially diminishing the reliance on traditional classroom settings. Additionally, automation and AI could pave the way for more efficient and effective learning processes, which might lessen the demand for human teachers in certain scenarios.On the other hand, I believe that the traditional teaching model will not vanish entirely. Human interaction and social engagement are vital components of the learning experience, and while technology can enhance these aspects, it cannot fully substitute for them. Teachers provide essential emotional support, guidance, and mentorship that contribute to students’ cognitive and socio-emotional growth. Furthermore, subjects such as arts, music, and physical education inherently require hands-on instruction and personal interaction, which suggests that they are unlikely to be completely replaced by technology.In summary, while technology will certainly continue to evolve and influence the education sector, I believe that traditional teaching methods will remain relevant in some capacity by 2050. A more probable outcome is that technology will enhance and complement established teaching practices rather than eliminate them. Ultimately, a balanced approach that integrates the advantages of technology with the importance of human interaction will be the most effective means of fostering student learning and development.
803;The use of corporal punishment (physically hitting students) in schools is in decline, yet it should be used to improve behaviour.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people believe that modifying behaviour among school-going children can be achieved through corporal punishment, and that it being on the decline in schools, is actually a negative development. I strongly disagree with this this view as I am of the opinion that there are better ways of disciplining children to instill positive behaviour, than physically hitting them.Improvement of behaviour among children in schools can be achieved through teaching them good manners rather than using corporal punishment. This means that teachers and school staff should teach children acceptable and unacceptable behaviour as part of their school curriculum from the earleist age they enter school. This way, learners obtain knowledge required for them to practice good behaviour. For example, if a child is taught from primary school-going age that they should clean after their mess, they are likely to practise and carry this behaviour through to secondary school. That way, there would be no need to physically hit children. Although some may firmly believe that corporal punishment is a good form of discipline, it cannot be compared to the actual teaching of good behaviour.Moreover, corporal punishment is likely to produce a fearful and resentful child rather than a well mannered child. It has been found by many researchers that children are unlikely to change their bad behaviour because they are beaten up at school. The behaviour is most likely to get worse, instead, as learners become fearful and resent their learning environment. For instance, in South Africa, some learners were reported to be disrespectful to their teachers because of a bad relationship that existed between them and their teachers as a result of corporal punishment that was inflicted on them. While it may be true that some positive behaviour changes were seen among pupils due to use of corporal punishment, this is at a very small scale.In conclusion, I am of the view that the use of corporal punishment among school-going age children is not a desirable phenomenon, as it is unlikely to produce any required behavioural changes. Instead, instilling good manners in learners through teaching them is more effective, as physically hitting them may even worsen their undesirable behaviour.;"I fundamentally oppose the idea that corporal punishment is an effective means of improving behavior in schools. The reduction of corporal punishment in educational settings is a commendable development, as this practice has been largely discredited by educators, psychologists, and advocates for human rights. Research indicates that physical punishment can result in numerous adverse effects, such as heightened aggression, increased anxiety, and lower academic performance.Moreover, corporal punishment can be viewed as a breach of children's rights, as outlined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. It constitutes a form of violence that can have enduring repercussions on a child's emotional and psychological health. In contrast, alternative disciplinary approaches—like positive reinforcement, restorative justice, and conflict resolution—have demonstrated greater effectiveness in enhancing behavior and fostering a positive school environment.For instance, in countries such as Sweden and Norway, where corporal punishment has been outlawed for many years, incidents of misbehavior in schools have decreased, accompanied by an overall improvement in student well-being. Many educational institutions have adopted substitutes for corporal punishment, such as ""restorative circles,"" allowing students to engage in constructive dialogue and resolve conflicts in a nurturing and supportive setting. These methods emphasize the development of responsibility, empathy, and self-regulation, rather than relying on fear and intimidation.In summary, corporal punishment is neither an effective nor an acceptable strategy for improving student behavior in schools. Instead, educational institutions should strive to cultivate a positive and supportive learning environment where students feel safe, respected, and valued. By embracing alternative disciplinary methods, schools can enhance social-emotional learning, promote conflict resolution, and improve academic performance—ultimately leading to better outcomes for students."
623;The use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction among many people in society. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;The modern world of social interaction changed completely over the past decades. Now many of us spent much more time interracting through social media, messengers for private or corporate messaging. We also use video conference and sharing our workflow remotely.As for me we have different needs satisfied by communication formed by different systems in our brain. On the one hand we have we communicate with each other aiming to get a useful information. On the other hand communication gives some non-verbal part like a sense of neing involved into one process, belonging to a circle of friends, collegues or family. These two sides of the process of communication are implemented differently that's why each part gets its own advantages and disadvantages thanks to changing integrating new social network technologies.If to talk about an information exchange - as for it became much more efficient with using messages, cloud storages and different coworking tools. But it is true only for those people who use these technology well. As far as I can see many advantages in remote work such as possibility not to waste time for commuting, offices and separate equipment, many people notice that their remote collegues disapperar often and avoid their duties. Some people couldn't concentrate while working at home. As for me people who experince such a problems are just addicted to strong stimules such as face-to face interraction and being managed by their boss. At the same time different internet based tools allow you to share much more information much faster and forever. Now you cannot just forget you task because you can always revise it in your work messenger and cloud folder wherever and whenever you are.One another need - is to have a social interraction. Of course ssocial network give us some advantage even in this area - now we can keep our relationships with more people across longer distances. While moving to another city or country we do not feel isolation so much anymore. It allows us to mentain or ralationships longer and stronger. At the same time such an option give people a possibility to avoid face-to-face communication with people phisically close to them. As for me it gives only one disadvantage - it is getting harder to load some parts of our brain which are evolutionary oriented to face-to-face interraction.I can conclude that social media interraction gave us some new possibilities and cut off some of the old ones. At the same time modern technologies blur boundaries between a real conversation and internet communication. Now we can perfectly see and hear each-other and even support financially. There are also some devises wich allow you to feel even more - like touches or heartrythm of each other. I think that new social media tools and some next directions of these tools will satisfy our face-to-face communication needs more and more over time.;The rise of social media has transformed how individuals communicate with one another. While it has undoubtedly simplified and enhanced connectivity, many contend that it is diminishing in-person interactions within society. I believe that the drawbacks of this trend surpass its benefits.On one hand, social media facilitates connections beyond geographic limits, creating new avenues for social engagement, business opportunities, and educational resources. It allows people to maintain relationships with friends and family across distances. Additionally, these platforms provide a venue for self-expression, enabling individuals to share their thoughts and connect with others who share similar interests.Conversely, the overuse of social media contributes to a decline in face-to-face communication, which is crucial for fostering strong relationships, interpreting non-verbal cues, and cultivating empathy. When individuals prioritize interactions with their screens over engaging with others in person, they risk losing essential social skills. Moreover, social media can propagate misinformation, cyberbullying, and unhealthy social comparisons, which can negatively impact mental health. In conclusion, although social media has its advantages, I think the disadvantages of reducing face-to-face encounters outweigh the benefits. It’s essential for individuals to find a balance between their online and offline lives to preserve meaningful relationships and a vibrant community. By being aware of our social media habits and actively participating in in-person interactions, we can enjoy the positive aspects of social media while also supporting our emotional and social health.
76;The world health organization recommends that people should eat five or more portion of fruit and vegetables per day. The bar chart shows the percentage of males and females in the UK by age group in 2006.You should write at least 150 words.;This bar chart depicts the percentage between male and female to eat five or above portion of fruit and vegetables per day in the UK. It is clear from the graph that the female is higher than male of percentage.According to what is shown, gradually increased from 19 to 34 ages same that from 35 to 54 ages. Between 55 and 64 ages is siginficant increased about between 19 and 24 ages, After that gradually decreased between 65 and 74. Although, Supposed to 25 and 34 ages, They the more consum but between 55 and 64 ages they is consum the highest. Also, The 75 age is the same percentage, unlike the all under 75 ages.To sum up, we could say that, the all ages is not equal between male and female in same percentage ages, except 75 age, They slight by 25 per cent between unisex. On other hand, Female and male is equal consume in 75 age.;The World Health Organization (WHO) highlights the necessity of consuming a minimum of five servings of fruits and vegetables each day to uphold a healthy lifestyle. In the UK context, the accompanying bar chart presents valuable insights into the eating habits of men and women across various age groups in 2006. This essay will explore the implications of the WHO's guidelines in relation to the data showcased in the bar chart.The chart reveals significant differences in the percentages of males and females meeting the WHO's recommendation for fruit and vegetable intake, depending on their age group. It shows that younger individuals generally have lower rates of compliance, whereas older age groups exhibit higher adherence to this dietary advice. For instance, women aged 50-64 and those 65 and older show greater percentages compared to younger females and their male counterparts.These findings suggest that older people are more likely to adopt healthy eating practices, possibly driven by greater health awareness or the emergence of health problems that require healthier eating. In contrast, younger people might lack awareness of the advantages of a diet abundant in fruits and vegetables or could encounter obstacles like cost, availability, or personal preferences that prevent them from achieving the recommended servings.In summary, the bar chart reveals disparities in fruit and vegetable consumption based on age and gender in the UK and highlights the necessity for targeted health campaigns and educational initiatives. Such efforts should aim to raise awareness among younger populations regarding the significance of a balanced diet that includes at least five servings of fruits and vegetables each day, as advised by the WHO. By instilling healthy eating habits early on, we can cultivate a society that prioritizes and maintains dietary choices that enhance overall health and prevent disease.
1426;The world is experiencing a dramatic increase in population, which is causing problems not only for poor, undeveloped countries, but also for industrialized and developed nations. Describe some of the problems that overpopulation causes, and suggest at least one possible solution.;You should write at least 250 words.You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.Nowadays, the population dramatically in most countries around the world. This is true for the developed and developing nations. Overpopulation a different number of problems. However, the government can these problems in many .There are several problems that the raising number of people in undeveloped countries causes. Firstly, it is very difficult to provide enough food for all people. Secondly, the government limits the number of children per family in school. In addition, in poorest countries usually have , and when the population increases, the number of . Finally, when too many people live on the land, the environment suffers.There are different problems that overpopulation causes in rich nations. Firstly, it is very difficult for governments to provide helpful public services in overcrowded cities. Moreover, there is generally a higher level of crimes being committed, such as drugs abuse, murders, thefts, . often cause by the high rates of unemployment.However, overpopulation problems in nations have two main which they are by governments. Firstly, the government must educate people about limiting the size of the family. For example, in China they have a policy called “one child policy” which limits the size of the family to one or two children, and this is beginning to have an effect on the world’s most crowded nation.To sum up, if the impulsive population increase continues, many more people will die of hunger in the poor countries. Also, in rich nations, the life in the cities will become more and more difficult.;The global population is increasing at an unprecedented pace, resulting in significant repercussions for both affluent and impoverished nations. Overpopulation represents a critical challenge, impacting the environment, economy, and quality of life for individuals. A key issue stemming from overpopulation is the pressure it places on natural resources. As the number of people rises, so does the demand for food, water, and energy, which often leads to shortages and depletion of these vital resources. Consequently, this can result in food and water scarcity, along with heightened greenhouse gas emissions that further contribute to climate change.Additionally, overpopulation heavily burdens urban infrastructure, resulting in overcrowding, increased poverty, and deteriorating living conditions. In developed nations, this may escalate expenses related to healthcare, education, and social services. In contrast, in developing countries, it can reinforce persistent cycles of poverty and inequality. Moreover, overpopulation contributes to the loss of biodiversity as natural habitats are sacrificed for expanding human settlements.To address these challenges, one effective strategy is to establish comprehensive family planning and educational initiatives. By ensuring access to contraception, reproductive healthcare, and education—especially for women and girls—governments and organizations can empower individuals to make informed decisions about family size. This approach can help slow population growth, alleviate poverty, and foster sustainable development. Furthermore, investing in sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, and thoughtful urban planning can ensure that the needs of expanding populations are met while mitigating adverse environmental impacts. Ultimately, tackling overpopulation demands a collaborative effort, involving governments, international bodies, and individuals committed to sustainable development and a viable future for everyone.
1313;There are many things that can motivate people to perform well in their work. These can include the salary, job satisfaction or the chance to help others. What do you feel is the best motivation to do well at work?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"To perform well in a job, people have to be motivated. There are multiple strategies for employers to incentivise their employees. The most obvious one is the salary; however, job satisfaction and the ability to help people are other methods of improving performance at work.For the majority of the people, receiving their salary at the end of the month is their motivation. This is because money is necessary to fulfill the most basic needs and other materialistic desires. Employees see these opportunities when receiving their salary and therefore work to achieve money. Furthermore, performing well in a job can often lead to promotions with higher pay packages. To receive this, staff have to stand out positively in their jobs. Salary is therefore a key motivational tool for many workforce participants.However, money is far from being the only incentive. Another aspect affecting performance is job satisfaction. If a person is comfortable in their work, they are more likely to perform well. Therefore this motivational tool interlinks with salary, as when people are content and perform well, the chances of promotion increase. For some individuals though, only their passion can drive them. Prime examples for this are humanitarian jobs. The salaries are often not very high, but those choosing to work in this field are often very driven; their passion to help others is prioritised over their own salary.In conclusion, while income might be the most common motivational factor, it is unusual to be the sole incentive for working hard, and some people are motivated wholly due to other reasons.";"When it comes to workplace motivation, there are several key factors that can inspire individuals to excel. While salary and job satisfaction certainly play important roles, I strongly believe that the opportunity to help others serves as the most compelling motivator. When individuals recognize that their work is positively impacting others, they are more likely to feel engaged and committed to their roles.Take teachers, for example; they are often driven by the desire to nurture young minds and effect change in their students' lives. Despite facing challenges like low pay and heavy workloads, many educators remain devoted to their vocation because of the fulfillment they derive from aiding their students' learning and development. Similarly, healthcare professionals such as doctors and nurses find motivation in the ability to save lives and enhance their patients’ health and well-being. Even in the face of long hours and demanding conditions, their commitment is fueled by the knowledge that their efforts are making a meaningful difference.Moreover, the desire to help others can cultivate a sense of community and teamwork within the workplace. When colleagues unite towards a shared objective of assisting others, they are more inclined to support and uplift each other. This collaborative spirit can create a more positive and effective work environment, where individuals feel appreciated and driven to excel.In summary, while financial compensation and job satisfaction are important motivators, I contend that the opportunity to help others stands out as the most significant factor in driving workplace performance. By instilling a sense of purpose and fulfillment, this motivation encourages individuals to exceed expectations and fosters a positive, supportive workplace culture."
1284;There is a moral necessity today for the richer countries of the world to help the poorer countries develop in terms of feeding the population, education and health care. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The world today is often divided into two categories, more developed and less developed countries. This division is significant in terms of health, wealth and education. To minimise this gap, it is argued that richer countries are morally responsible to support the less wealthy. I, personally, feel that the prosperous countries are obligated and expected to to contribute to the development of countries with weaker economies.To address this argument, the history of the wealthy countries is relevant. Many less developed countries are former colonies, therefore the wealthy countries had a historical impact on the less wealthy. Thus, richer countries’ economies were dependent on the currently less developed countries for their rich status. Furthermore, even today the wealthy countries contribute to the wealth inequality by exploiting the inhabitants of less developed countries, giving workers lower wages than people within their own countries. Due to this dependence on poorer countries and the influence that the richer countries have had on the imbalance, it can be concluded that richer countries are indeed morally obliged to help the less wealthy countries.Opposing this is the view that each country is in charge of their own inhabitants and that therefore they need to provide health, education and basic necessities for themselves. In addition, simply providing these three services would not lead to closing the wealth gap. It would rather be helpful to invest sustainably in poorer countries and help them create their own systems, allowing these countries to be self-sufficient.In conclusion, while there is a moral necessity for wealthy countries to aid the poorer ones, simply providing basic necessities is not sufficient. A more sustainable idea would be to teach countries to plan and provide for themselves by giving economic incentives.;I wholeheartedly support the belief that wealthier nations have a moral obligation to assist poorer countries in their development, particularly in areas like food security, education, and healthcare. The stark differences in wealth and resources across the globe present a significant challenge, making it essential for affluent countries to extend their support.Firstly, ensuring access to adequate nutrition is a basic human right. Countless individuals in developing nations face hunger and malnutrition, resulting in dire consequences for their health, productivity, and quality of life. Wealthy countries are ethically compelled to provide food assistance and promote sustainable agricultural practices in these regions. A notable example is the United States' Food for Peace program, which has played a crucial role in delivering emergency food support to countries experiencing conflicts, natural disasters, or economic turmoil.In addition, education is vital for development as it enables individuals and communities to escape the cycle of poverty. Wealthier nations can offer financial and technical support to enhance educational infrastructure, train teachers, and improve access to quality education in less developed countries. For instance, the UK's Department for International Development has implemented programs in nations such as Nigeria and Pakistan, resulting in significant gains in enrollment and learning outcomes.Furthermore, healthcare is a critical element of development that demands attention from richer countries. Insufficient access to essential healthcare services—such as vaccinations, maternal care, and disease prevention—can lead to serious public health issues. Affluent nations can contribute medical aid, expertise, and funding to bolster healthcare systems in less fortunate countries. An illustrative case is the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which, backed by wealthy countries, has made remarkable progress in addressing these diseases in developing regions.In summary, the ethical responsibility of wealthier nations to assist poorer countries in their development is unmistakable. By offering support in food security, education, and healthcare, affluent countries can alleviate suffering, foster sustainable development, and mitigate global inequalities. Together, we must strive to ensure that everyone has access to fundamental human needs, and it is crucial for richer nations to take initiative in this vital endeavor.
1217;There is growing evidence that man-made activities are making global temperatures higher.What might be the man-made causes of temperatures rising? How should we deal with this problem?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In the last years the problem of global warming is becaming more and more debated. One of the main causes of the temperature rising are men-made activities. Almost all the activities made by humans produce a huge impact on the natural environment. For instance, some of the usual activities made daily by people are impacting. Indeed, the chemical products they buy and use as well as the ways of trasportation's abuse can be annoverated among the main reasons for global warming. Lastly, even if it is the more impacting, there is the industral system and their production of slags.The first impact made by men-activities concerns the product they use. There are at least three kinds of products that may cause the rising of temperature. First, there are products like lacquaer and foam. Because they were beed uncontrolled used during the last decades, they have been one of the main causes of the Ozone Hole. Spray products, even if they are just suncream or hair conditionars could be very impacting because of their chemical composition. Another men-activity that impact a lot on the environment concern their use of the way of transportation. Indeed, the abuse of private ways of trasportation caused an increasement of pollution and a dramatic increase of the level of petrol in the environment. Petrol is not only one of the main reason for global warming but also the first responsible for sea's pollution. Furthermore, the dayly use of flight cause pollution in the air and now restriction on the abuse of this way of trasportation are trying to be a kind of solution to the problem.Lastly, one of the main causes of global temperatures higher is the industrial system. Indeed, they used to point to the cheaper solution to produce and eliminate the radioactive waste. The problem of a prodaction that does not take care of the environment pointed to use polluting products and machines. Furthermore, the industrial system point to produce more and more causing the waste of energy and raw materials. For instance, the fashion industry is one of the more pulluting in the world. It abuses of materials and energies whithout caring abuut the waste of them. Finally, the problem of the way in which the industries procede in elimnating waste is crucial. Indeed, in the last years they used to disperse the waste on the sea. This tendecy was increased for two reasosns: saving and speed. These are the two eassential words of industrial system.In conclusion, I think there are two main reasons that cause the raising of global temperatures that can be annoverated among the others. Those that concern the personal and daily activities of men (use of determinate products and ways of trasportation) and then those activities operate by the industrial system.;The increase in global temperatures has emerged as a critical issue in recent years, with widespread acknowledgment of the significant role that human activities play in this challenge. Among the main human-induced factors contributing to rising temperatures are the release of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, through the combustion of fossil fuels, along with deforestation.The burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, factories, and power plants emits large quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which traps heat and contributes to the warming of the planet. Additionally, clearing forests for agriculture or urban development not only removes essential carbon sinks but also disrupts local ecosystems, worsening the greenhouse effect.To effectively tackle this issue, a comprehensive strategy is necessary. Governments and businesses must prioritize investments in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, to lessen our dependence on fossil fuels. Moreover, reforestation initiatives and sustainable land-use practices can aid in restoring natural carbon sinks and alleviating the impacts of deforestation. On an individual level, adopting simple practices like using public transportation, carpooling, or driving electric vehicles can meaningfully reduce our personal carbon footprints.Countries like Norway serve as a prime example, having made significant progress in promoting electric vehicle adoption, with over half of new car sales being electric. These initiatives illustrate that with collaborative efforts and appropriate policies, we can achieve meaningful reductions in our impact on global temperatures. Ultimately, combating the challenge of rising temperatures requires a unified global response that combines systemic changes with individual actions to protect the future of our planet.
1427;There is no longer enough natural resources to sustain current levels of economic growth. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Recently, the natural resources risen dramatically across the world due to population growth. Some people state that we enough resources. However, there are some individuals who disagree with this opinion. In this essay, the issues behind this phenomenon will be examined.On the one hand, some people state that if will continue to we cannot have a comfortable life because natural resources are limited. According to a if this situation will continue, the petrol will in 2050. Moreover, it is widely said that the will increase. This will make the amount of natural .On the other hand, there are some individuals who disagree with above-mentioned perception. The natural resources will technology. For example, the of technology such as cars a positive impact the society. By using this, we can the consumption of natural resources. Eventually, we will not need natural fuel. In my opinion, of natural is , I think the loss of it a negative impact the society because won’t have a comfortable life any more.In conclusion, I agree with the idea that there is no longer enough natural resources to sustain this situation. In order to our life, the governments countries should tackle this issue.;The idea that there are not enough natural resources to support ongoing economic growth has generated significant discussion. While I recognize the urgent issues related to resource depletion, I only partially concur with this assertion.On one side, it is clear that the depletion of the Earth's natural resources, such as water, oil, and minerals, is occurring at a concerning pace. The extraction and use of these resources have resulted in significant environmental damage, evident through climate change, deforestation, and pollution. For instance, the World Wildlife Fund estimates that if current consumption trends persist, we will require the resources of two planets to maintain our lifestyle by 2025. This highlights valid concerns regarding the viability of the existing economic growth models.Conversely, I do not believe that the situation is entirely hopeless. Human creativity and technological progress have consistently led to innovations that help address resource limitations. For example, advancements in renewable energy technologies, like solar and wind power, have decreased our dependence on fossil fuels. Furthermore, circular economy initiatives and recycling advancements are being adopted to reduce waste and enhance resource efficiency. These innovations illustrate that economic growth and environmental sustainability can coexist.In summary, while I acknowledge that the current pace of resource depletion is unsustainable, I contest the notion that sustaining current levels of economic growth is impossible. By adopting sustainable practices, investing in renewable energy, and encouraging environmentally friendly technologies, we can alleviate the strain on our natural resources. Ultimately, a balanced strategy that emphasizes both economic development and environmental stewardship is crucial for creating a sustainable future.
1324;These days, many young people are not spending their weekends and holidays doing outdoor activities such as hiking or mountaineering. Why is that happening? How can they be encouraged to spend more time in the natural environment?;Nowadays, the younger generation tends to avoid recreational activities such as hiking or alpinism. It seems that young people prefer to spend their weekends indoors, gaming or engaging in other online activities. If that is the case, by promoting sports more actively and organising sports competitions, the schools could counteract this trend.Living in the era of technology, the wide availability and variety of online entertainment are compelling young people to spend a lot of their free time indoors, using their gadgets. Numerous relatively cheap forms of amusement, such as online games, videos, audiobooks and plenty of other activities, tempt teenagers to stay at home and lead more sedentary lifestyles. A recent survey revealed that the vast majority of students would prefer spending their weekends playing computer games, rather than in the nature. That is one clear reason why our modern youth is less interested in recreational sports.To address this issue, the school management could intervene and offer a better range of outdoor sports activities and competitions, both within the school curriculum and as extra-curricular activities. For example, high schools could increase the number of weekly football, running and climbing classes, and organise competitions at the end of each term. As a result, pushed by their desire to win, students would do more walking, jogging, running and mountaineering during the school term, in preparation for the competition. This would reduce the time spent online, lessen the students’ dependence on the Internet for entertainment, and eventually boost their desire to spend more time enjoying the natural environment.To sum up, screen addiction plays a major role in young people’s avoidance of various outdoor activities. Opening up more recreational sports and offering frequent competitions on school grounds is a great way to motivate more students to spend their leisure time in the nature.;The decline in young people's outdoor activities, especially during weekends and holidays, is a troubling trend. A major factor contributing to this change is the growing attraction of digital entertainment and social media. Today, many young individuals prefer to spend their leisure time playing video games, surfing the web, or interacting on online platforms, rather than exploring the great outdoors. Furthermore, increased urbanization has reduced access to natural spaces, making it less convenient for youth to engage in outdoor pursuits such as hiking or mountaineering.Another critical aspect is the lack of awareness regarding the benefits of spending time outside. Many young people are not informed about how outdoor activities can positively impact their physical and mental health. To motivate them to embrace nature, it's crucial to highlight the advantages of outdoor activities through educational institutions and social media channels. Organizing group outings, like school trips or community hikes, can also make outdoor experiences more attractive and accessible. Additionally, investing in the creation of parks and recreational areas in urban environments can provide more opportunities for young people to interact with nature.In the end, a blend of education, improved access, and social involvement is essential to encourage youth to spend more time outdoors. By nurturing a greater appreciation for nature and offering safe and enjoyable exploration opportunities, we can inspire a new generation to engage in outdoor activities and enjoy their many benefits. This approach not only boosts individual well-being but also fosters a stronger sense of environmental responsibility and stewardship among young individuals.
919;To be labelled a ‘Work of Art’, a painting, sculpture or other art form should display certain qualities that are unique. However, over the past century there has been a decline in the quality of prize-winning artwork and it is now possible for quite ordinary pieces of art to be labelled ‘masterpieces ’ whilst true works of art pass unnoticed.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;For centuries, artworks have been titled  'Work of Art' based on their extraordinary qualities. However, some people argue that nowadays, the standards are decreasing and the labelling of substandard artworks as 'masterpieces' has become ubiquitous. The upcoming essay will discuss why I agree that original paintings are being neglected while usual ones are being praised.Firstly, the superficial nature of humans is responsible for this change. These days, people do not see the meaning behind the painting or the message the artist is trying to convey rather they buy those paintings which are popular and contemporary. To illustrate it further, in art auctions it can be seen that when one person bids on one painting, no matter whether it is good or bad, others also start putting their money on it. Thus it is clear that normal art forms are winning prizes due to public attention.Secondly, some artists might bribe the organizers of exhibitions to promote their canvas. Indeed, there have been some recorded instances when artists were caught while signing up deals to increase the sales of their work. If a certain artwork receives publicity then it is impossible that it would not have an influence on the public. This type of promotion skews a person's opinion about a certain picture and so are forced to think about purchasing it, leaving behind original ones. Therefore, it is apparent that the diabolical activities of painters are responsible for their works being labelled as masterpieces.To conclude, the maintenance of social position and influence of painters are the prime causes for the popularity of ordinary artworks and the negligence of true works. Hence I agree with the given statement.;"The idea that a piece of art must have specific characteristics to be deemed a masterpiece has sparked considerable discussion among critics and art lovers alike. While some contend that the caliber of award-winning art has diminished over the last century, I hold a different view. I believe that the definition of art has transformed, and what was once regarded as commonplace can now be perceived as remarkable.This change can largely be attributed to the evolving landscape of art itself. With the emergence of conceptual and contemporary movements, the emphasis has shifted from mere technical skill to the realms of creative vision and originality. A prime example of this is Marcel Duchamp's ""Fountain"" (1917), a urinal signed ""R. Mutt,"" which challenged conventional definitions of art and ignited a new avant-garde movement. Similarly, Andy Warhol's ""Campbell's Soup Cans"" (1962) blurred the distinctions between high and low culture, illustrating that artistry can be found in everyday objects.Additionally, the art scene has become increasingly diverse, with artists from varied backgrounds and styles gaining prominence. The expansion of the art market and the democratizing effect of the internet have transformed how we encounter and engage with art. This heightened accessibility has broadened our understanding of what qualifies as a work of art. While some may interpret this shift as a decline in quality, I perceive it as a chance for innovation and experimentation.In conclusion, I argue that the perceived decline in the quality of award-winning artwork is a matter of personal interpretation. The art world is in a continual state of evolution, and what is hailed as a masterpiece today may not have received the same recognition in the past. As our comprehension of art grows, so too does our appreciation for the diverse array of creative expressions around us. Ultimately, a work of art should be evaluated based on its power to inspire, provoke, and engage, irrespective of its technical mastery or adherence to traditional standards."
1338;Today children are spending much more time watching TV compared to the past. Why do you think this happens? Is this a positive or a negative change?;"A trend has emerged in the last two decades with youngsters watching more TV than ever before. One of the main reasons behind this issue is the recent advancements in technology in gaming and film industries. This tendency has both pros and cons, and will be further discussed in this essay.The latest developments in video game consoles attracted both children and adults to spend extra time watching TV, compared to the past. With interactive gaming characters and high quality graphics, children are more likely to spend long hours playing games in front of the TV. A recent survey showed that TV addiction among young people, for example, has significantly increased from 5% to 80%, which was supposedly caused by the introduction of advanced gaming consoles. This increase is also partially due to films, drama series and cartoons being easily available on pirated websites and various gaming platforms.This trend has had more negative than positive effects on young citizens. More time spent watching TV adversely affects the mental and physical wellbeing of a child. For instance, the obesity ratio among young individuals in the past 10 years has risen dramatically; this has caused further health problems such as anxiety and depression. However, TV can also be used in a positive way. It is a great source of information that can help youngsters increase their knowledge and succeed in their future careers.In conclusion, recent breakthroughs in technology are driving up the amount of time our youngsters are spending in front of their TV screens. This can do more harm than good if we don’t regulate the use of TV, but parents have the power to make TV time useful and beneficial for their children.";The amount of time children devote to watching television has notably risen compared to previous years. Several factors contribute to this trend. Firstly, the easy availability of TVs and various viewing devices allows children to watch for longer durations. Additionally, the extensive selection of child-friendly programs and channels plays a significant role in this increase. Many parents, often juggling work and other commitments, might turn to TV as a convenient way to keep their children entertained and occupied.However, this shift carries predominantly negative consequences. Excessive television viewing has been associated with various adverse effects on children's physical and mental well-being, including obesity, reduced attention spans, and lower academic achievement. Watching TV tends to be a passive experience that diminishes children's opportunities for imaginative play, social interaction, and outdoor activities, all of which are vital for their cognitive, emotional, and physical growth.Moreover, prolonged TV watching can expose children to inappropriate content, such as violence, advertising, and harmful stereotypes, which can significantly affect their values, attitudes, and behaviors. Parents and caregivers must recognize these risks and take proactive measures to limit and supervise their children's viewing habits, while promoting more balanced and engaging activities like reading, sports, and creative endeavors. By doing this, we can help children cultivate healthy habits, a solid sense of self, and a diverse skill set that will serve them throughout their lives. Ultimately, it is essential to tackle this issue and encourage a more active, imaginative, and socially engaged childhood for the well-being and development of our children.
603;Today family members do not eat meals together. Why does this happen? Is this a positive or negative developmentGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Dinner tables are no longer a place for family reunion in today's society. Reasons from many aspects account for this phenomenon which pose a huge threat to the happiness of family and the harmony of society.Causes vary from person to person. Some people, especially the young believing that conflicts are common on dinner tables, tend to have meals with their friends rather than their family members. But most people are deprived of their rights by the development of society. Too busy to get home at dinner time, people have to eat meals near workplace. Also, with the job diversity increasing, rarely can family members with different timetables eat meals at the same period. For instance, a bank agent getting home at 6 pm tends to miss her doctor husband leaving home at 5 pm for emergency work.It is the advantages of sharing meals with family that attach great importance to this event. Time for communication is so critical that families lacking such opportunities are often full of misunderstandings and quarrels. Not only can this development increase the divorce rate but it may also decrease the marriage rate. Because support and care from family, the previous harbor, is deprived and people see no significance from getting married. With such phenomenon prevailing, the negative emotions may take advantage in the society. Loneliness, distress and helplessness stike those always eating alone.In a nutshell, taking the damage to both families and societies into consideration, various solutions should be put forward to the roots behind the situation.;The traditional family dinner, a time when everyone comes together to share a meal, has become increasingly uncommon in today’s fast-moving society. With hectic schedules, family members often find themselves dining in solitude or rushing their meals. This shift is primarily due to the pressures of contemporary life, where work, school, and extracurricular commitments take precedence over spending quality time with family.I believe this trend is largely detrimental. Sharing meals as a family offers invaluable opportunities for connection, the exchange of experiences, and the creation of treasured memories. When family members eat separately, they forgo these important interactions, which can foster feelings of isolation and disconnection. Moreover, studies indicate that regular family meals are associated with better communication, improved emotional health, and even enhanced academic performance in children.Additionally, this trend can contribute to unhealthy eating habits. Individuals who eat alone are more likely to choose convenience foods or takeout, which are often laden with calories, salt, and sugar. In contrast, family meals usually feature home-cooked dishes that are healthier and more balanced. For example, in my own family, we make it a point to gather for meals several times a week, and this has led to both healthier eating patterns and a stronger sense of togetherness.In summary, the decline of family meals is a concerning trend that can significantly impact our physical and emotional health. By prioritizing family time and making a concerted effort to eat together, we can nurture a sense of unity, encourage healthier habits, and create lasting memories. It is essential for us to recognize the value of family meals and work to uphold this vital tradition amid our busy lives.
883;Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;There is no doubt that nowadays advertising plays a very strong role in saling goods. The high rate of sales does not always mean the real needs of some goods. In this essay, i will discuss both views and draw my personal conclusion.In terms of advertising's power in increasing sales of popular consumer goods, advertising has an essencial role these days in sales. The main reason given to support this claim is advertisnig attracts people and inform people about the new and special products in a very special way. To illustrate, using social media for marketing and advertising raise sales dramatecly. People spend most of their times to watch what is in the social media and that means social media is the best way to do your marketing.However, some people say that people buy these products not because they really need them but because they like the way that was used to advertise these products. On the other hand, some times people purchase goods because they have seen them or heard about them from others or from the social media not due to their needs of these products.In conclusion, I believe that increasing the sales of some popular consumer goods show how strong is advertising and how advertising plays a crucial role in saling products. Also, smart business owners should think about advertising as a fast way to sale their goods. As was previously menthond, people can be attracted by all kinds of advertising and that definitly lead to increasing the sale rate.;The idea that high sales of widely popular consumer products are primarily due to advertising rather than true societal needs has ignited a lively debate. I largely believe that advertising significantly influences sales, yet I also contend that genuine societal needs cannot be overlooked.On one hand, advertising has emerged as a potent instrument in shaping consumer behavior. Through innovative marketing tactics and engaging narratives, advertisers can instill a perceived necessity for a product, even if it doesn’t meet a critical requirement. For example, the yearly launch of new smartphone models often incites excitement among consumers, many of whom feel compelled to upgrade to the latest version. In these instances, advertising clearly plays a role in boosting sales, as individuals are convinced that owning the newest device is vital for staying connected and relevant.Conversely, it’s important to recognize that certain consumer goods fulfill real societal needs. For instance, the demand for healthcare products, food, and clothing is often driven by actual necessities rather than mere advertising. People need these fundamental items for survival and to maintain a minimum standard of living. Additionally, some products serve to address specific challenges people encounter, such as energy-efficient appliances or systems for purifying water.In summary, while advertising clearly shapes consumer behavior and contributes to high sales, it is not the exclusive factor. Real societal needs also significantly influence the demand for particular products. A well-rounded perspective acknowledges the interplay between these two elements, with advertising enhancing and molding how individuals view and react to their genuine needs. Ultimately, the relationship among advertising, sales, and societal needs is intricate, and a nuanced comprehension is vital to understand the dynamics at work.
1328;Today’s young generation is facing many problems at school and at home. What are the problems? What can parents do to help their teenage children?;"Young people today are under a lot of pressure, which seems to come from many directions. The problems they are experiencing happen not only at school, but also at home, and it seems that without adult guidance, our young generation will continue to struggle.Teenage years have never been simple, and many would agree that the amount of challenges has only increased with the passage of time. Bullying has been a problem for quite a while, and children and adolescents would have experienced it at school in the past, but then it would stop at home. At present, however, things have been made worse by social media penetrating the supposedly safe space of our teenagers. The unfortunate behaviour of their peers can now reach them even in their bedrooms, causing them constant distress.Another issue troubling many young people is the pressure to succeed by their families. Whether at school or at home, they often feel as if they are not smart enough, which creates overwhelm and despair. Understandably, their parents are pursuing a worthy goal of ensuring their children get a great start in life; however, many teens feel that they are failing their families when they don’t live up to their expectations. This often leads to dishonest and unethical behaviour, such as cheating on tests or plagiarising other students’ work. When uncovered, these incidents have a profound effect on young people’s future careers, not to mention their emotional well-being.It is hard to underestimate the importance of parental support to navigating life as a young person. From helping teens build a positive body image and self-esteem, to handling classmates’ difficult behaviour, to guidance where study is concerned, parents can make a world of difference. Talking to their sons and daughters about matters that worry them, listening and making non-judgmental suggestions are great ways to help. Getting a professional involved where necessary and engaging with teachers, councilors and coaches is another opportunity for parents to provide assistance. Last but not least, parents can make their children better and happier people by simply giving them unconditional love.To sum up, being a young person in the modern world isn’t easy. By banding together and paying careful attention to their teens, families can help them overcome any obstacles to becoming successful adults.";"Today's younger generation is undoubtedly grappling with a variety of challenges both at school and at home. Among the most common issues are academic pressure, social media dependency, and bullying. Many students find themselves swamped by homework, exams, and extracurricular commitments, resulting in heightened stress and anxiety. Additionally, the rise of social media has fostered a culture of comparison and competition, which can severely impact a teenager’s self-esteem and mental well-being.At home, teenagers often encounter challenges such as family disputes, communication gaps with parents, and restricted freedoms. High parental expectations and stringent rules can lead to feelings of rebellion and confinement in adolescents. To assist their teenage children in navigating these difficulties, parents have a crucial role to play. First and foremost, open and honest communication is essential; parents should listen to their children's concerns and acknowledge their feelings. This helps foster trust and creates a safe environment for teenagers to express themselves.Moreover, parents can assist by establishing realistic expectations and offering emotional support. Encouraging involvement in extracurricular activities and hobbies that enhance mental and physical health is also beneficial. Additionally, parents should stay tuned to their children’s online behaviors and engage in regular discussions about social media use and its risks. By being supportive, understanding, and involved, parents can empower their teenagers to build resilience, self-assurance, and the vital life skills needed to address the challenges they encounter at school and home. Ultimately, through collaboration, parents and teenagers can cultivate a stronger, more loving relationship that promotes a positive and nurturing atmosphere for growth and development."
1310;Tourism today creates a variety of problems, such as pollution due to flights, transport and dirty water.Do you think that governments should impose extra taxes on flights or accommodation to restrict today’s tourism industry?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Travelling today is simple to the extent that within twelve hours one can travel from Europe to Singapore, crossing nearly the whole globe. Based on this simplicity, tourism has changed significantly over the years. While in the past a family would be proud to drive two hours to a lake, many families now think nothing of travelling to the far side of the world. This also has a downside as increased pollution is a result. Extra taxes on flights or accommodation have therefore been offered as a solution so as to increase the cost of tourism and reduce its popularity.No matter what major transportation is used, travelling creates pollution. To decrease the amount of pollution caused by tourism, the tourism industry itself would have to be weakened. If these increased taxes are based on travelling distance, people would be more willing to stay closer to their home country, as for many even a slight increase would mean that their planned holidays would be too expensive. Accommodation taxes would raise holiday costs no matter the distance travelled. Therefore, if increased taxes were levied on travel and accommodation, tourism and therefore pollution would decrease.On the other hand, the main transport methods that would be impacted by imposing extra taxes would be communal ones, such as planes, trains and buses, and increasing the taxes would also impact non-tourists. Also, holidays are a vital part of ordinary people’s lives, as they escape from work and stress, and get to spend valuable time with their families. Stopping people travelling would greatly impact some simple pleasures of ordinary life.In conclusion, while tourism impacts the environment significantly, simply introducing extra taxes on transport or accommodation is a drastic measure. It could be more valuable to change the methods of transportation to decrease pollution, instead making people stay close to home.;The tourism sector has witnessed remarkable growth in recent years, with millions of individuals traveling around the world daily. However, this increase in tourism has led to numerous challenges, such as pollution, environmental harm, and pressure on local resources. One of the primary issues is the pollution stemming from flights, transportation, and contaminated water. In light of these challenges, the question arises as to whether governments should introduce additional taxes on flights or accommodations to help manage the tourism industry.In my view, implementing extra taxes on flights or accommodations is a practical approach to alleviating the adverse effects of tourism. By imposing these taxes, governments can discourage excessive travel and generate revenue that can be utilized to address the environmental impacts of tourism. For example, Venice, known for its overcrowding and pollution, has implemented a tourist tax to help manage visitor numbers and support conservation initiatives. Similarly, New Zealand has introduced a tourist tax aimed at preserving its unique biodiversity and pristine landscapes.Furthermore, additional taxes can motivate the tourism industry to adopt more sustainable practices, such as investing in renewable energy, minimizing waste, and promoting eco-friendly lodging options. This shift can lead to a more responsible and environmentally-aware tourism sector. Moreover, the funds collected from these taxes can benefit local communities and promote cultural heritage, ensuring that the advantages of tourism are distributed more fairly.Nevertheless, it is crucial to find a balance between regulating tourism and maintaining the economic benefits it delivers to local communities. Excessive taxation could negatively impact small businesses and areas heavily dependent on tourism. Ultimately, a thoughtfully constructed tax system that caters to the specific needs and challenges of each destination can help address the issues tied to tourism while still allowing individuals to experience and enjoy the world's rich cultures and natural beauty.
861;Traffic and housing problems could be solved by moving large companies, factories and their employees to the countryside.Do you agree or disagree?;Many metropolises are facing challenges, including traffic gams and serious lacking of housing available for families to live, particular in the developed countries. The governments are looking for a way to lessen the volume of traffic in the cities and to increase the number of housing provision over the metropolises. Some people advocate the businesses including large corporations and factories along with their employees moving to the suburbs which is the best way to figure out the metropolitan problems. Is this a sheer solution for these challenges faced by the cities?Economy boom in a country is accompanied with a number of problems incurred in the cities due to the multitudes living in there. It is no wonder that metropolises represent more job opportunities available and better education system to next generations. These are strong pull factors appealing people to stay in the cities despite the higher cost in living. A larger number of populations in the cities not only result in a severe shortage of housing where there is a higher demand of housing over the available supply, but also bring the higher volume of traffic across the cities, particular in a peak hour when a thousand and one employees commuting to work and students going to schools. Some people believe the working location shifting to rural areas is a solution that enables to lessen the frequent usage of roads in cities. Simultaneously, it is assumed that the housing issue can be solved naturally arising from the migration of their employees into the suburban town next to their working place.The business allocated to suburbs alone is rarely considered enough to tackle these problems. A place to live requires the basic facilities to serve for clothing, food, housing and transportation which are basic needs of human. If there is a working place and residential area only in the suburban town without any infrastructures, people have no choice to drive their vehicles back and forth between cities and their living places for the general consumption. As a consequence, the traffic congestion in cities will be worsen combining with the significant deterioration of air quality in the countryside due to an increase in the emission of the greenhouse gases. Therefore, the governments play a key role to establish a neighborhood which could be self-sufficient communities outside of their larger metropolitan areas. This may be a feasible and effective way to minimize the metropolitan issues.My own view is that the shifting strategies in suburbs can help lessen the challenges faced by metropolises. But the governments should take the smart planning into consideration in which the employment bases with the living infrastructures are developed in the suburban town.;The idea of moving large corporations, factories, and their workforce to rural areas as a means to ease traffic and housing challenges in urban settings is an interesting one. While this concept may appear to offer a feasible solution, it does come with its own set of challenges. I find myself in partial agreement with this viewpoint.On one hand, shifting major companies and manufacturing plants to the countryside could indeed lessen traffic congestion and ease housing shortages in cities. By decentralizing these industries, there would be fewer commuters traveling to and from urban areas, resulting in reduced traffic congestion and lower levels of air pollution. Moreover, this shift could decrease the demand for housing in cities, potentially leading to increased affordability for residents.Conversely, the relocation of entire industries to rural regions could have significant economic and social repercussions for both urban and rural communities. For example, rural areas might lack the necessary infrastructure to accommodate large-scale industrial operations, and building this infrastructure could be prohibitively expensive. Additionally, moving factories and businesses could result in job losses in urban centers and disrupt the social dynamics of communities built around these industries.In summary, while transferring large companies and factories to rural areas could present certain advantages in alleviating traffic and housing issues, it is not a simple solution. A more layered approach, such as investing in sustainable urban planning and enhanced transportation systems, might prove to be more effective in tackling these challenges. Ultimately, a balanced and comprehensive strategy is essential to address the complex issues surrounding traffic and housing in urban environments.
1229;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;While some people argue that equal numbers of male and female students should be accepted in every major, I personally disagree with this statement.There are a number of arguments that can support my stance. To begin with, it is impossible to enroll equal genders of students in every subject. It is true that some faculties are underrepresented by a particular gender. For example, STEM subjects usually have more male students than females, but the opposite is true in educational-related subjects, which phenomenon seems to violate the principle that we fight endeavor today, gender equality. Therefore, people want to accept equal numbers of students to achieve a gender balance in every subject. However, the reality is that different genders prefer to study different subjects themselves, but not because of the unequal opportunity. According to one of the research, women show a higher interest in subjects like education, psychology and arts rather than science-related subjects. As a result, it is apparent that admitting equivalent proportions of male and female students can hardly be achieved.In addition, it will deprive students of chances to make their own choices if universities enroll both genders equally in every subject mandatorily. It should be noted that it is students' right to select the subjects freely in college. If students cannot register for the subjects they want to study just because there are not enough quotas left for particular gender of students, or they are forced to study some subjects they are not interested in just because they need to fulfill the gender requirement in the class, it will hinder students' learning in the long-run.To conclude, universities should not enroll equal gender students in every subject as it is impossible to achieve and may deprive students the freedom to choose the major they want to study.;The proposal for universities to maintain an equal number of male and female students across all subjects has ignited a vigorous discussion. While some advocates argue that this strategy supports gender equality, others contend that it can result in discrimination and inefficiency. I find myself partially agreeing with this perspective.On one side, achieving equal representation of males and females in various subjects can help address the gender imbalance in fields such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), where men have traditionally outnumbered women. By encouraging female participation in these disciplines, universities can create a more diverse and inclusive academic atmosphere. For example, several universities have successfully launched initiatives aimed at encouraging female students to engage in STEM studies, leading to a notable rise in female enrollment and graduation rates.Conversely, I oppose the implementation of a rigid 50-50 ratio across all subjects. Such a policy could result in the exclusion of more qualified candidates from one gender in favor of less qualified candidates from the other. Additionally, certain subjects may inherently attract students of a particular gender based on their interests or natural inclinations. For instance, nursing and childcare programs typically enroll more female students, while engineering and computer science often attract more males. Enforcing a strict gender ratio in these situations could undermine the quality of education and hinder opportunities for students who have a genuine passion for their chosen field.In summary, while advocating for gender equality in university admissions is crucial, I believe a flexible and thoughtful approach is vital. Instead of mandating an equal 50-50 ratio, universities should aim to cultivate an inclusive and supportive environment that inspires students of all genders to explore their interests and passions. This way, we can foster diversity and equality without sacrificing educational quality.
1433;Universities should allocate the same amount of money to their sport activities as they allocate to their libraries. Do you agree or disagree?;Yes, I do feel that universities should have an equal budget for their libraries as well as sport activities. It is our general belief that a good player can not be good student and hence we restrict our children’s sport activities at college level. Moreover, an academic degree has much more value than sport activities which naturally compels students to focus more on their studies than their interest in sport.Most of the universities keep sports at of their priority list, good players do not get enough facilities and to improve their skills and eventually they their interest.Universities can play substantial role in shaping this upcoming talent by providing good trainers and which is otherwise too expensive to afford. Also it will attract other students sports and inculcate importance of physical fitness in them.Universities should produce in all fields rather than only concentrating on progress of scholars. Hence, I feel that universities should allot equal amounts of money to as well as sport activities.;The distribution of university funds continues to be a contentious issue, with some advocating for equal financial support for both sports programs and libraries. While I acknowledge the role of sports in enhancing student well-being and enriching campus life, I firmly believe that libraries should receive more funding than sports activities.Libraries are fundamental to academic institutions, offering students access to a wide range of resources such as books, journals, and online databases. These materials are crucial for coursework completion, research, and the development of critical thinking skills. In contrast, although sports activities positively impact students’ physical and mental health, they are not as integral to the university's academic objectives. Moreover, libraries serve a significantly larger portion of the student population, as all students rely on library resources to fulfill their degree requirements, whereas sports programs benefit a smaller, though still important, segment of the student body.Moreover, libraries necessitate substantial investments in infrastructure, technology, and staff to keep their collections up-to-date, which can be quite expensive. Diverting equal funds toward sports programs could compromise the quality and accessibility of library resources, ultimately impeding students' academic success. Therefore, universities should aim for a balanced approach that supports both sports activities and library resources, while acknowledging the distinct significance each holds within the university community. By prioritizing funding for libraries, universities can ensure that students have the essential resources they need to thrive academically, while still providing opportunities for participation in sports and other extracurricular pursuits.
1387;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;Today computers are used almost everywhere, it is impossible to imagine our life without PCs, Internet, mobile phones and other computer devices. It is reasonable to think that people look forward to the future of computers., computers make our life easier, we can easily get information about any product we plan to buy or place we plan to visit in a second using a personal computer and . Scientists predict that in the nearest future it will be possible to smell a new perfume using the Internet and watch 3D scenes at home like we do in the movie theater. According to forecasts of HR agencies machines will replace jobs of cashiers, and civil and military pilots. Some corporations in Japan are already sellinghousewife-robots, which help old people to keep their homes clean.Despite the fact that computers help us, they make us dependent. Apparently, people spend more time behind monitors than ever before. And some of them feel a need for more time to be spent with people in live contact. In addition, a breakdown of one of the important modules of a specific computer can entail serious consequences. to mention the computer problem that occurred in the end of 1990s, a problem related to the coming year 2000 (Y2K) and catastrophes that were predicted. Fortunately imminent disasters did not happen. However, it is difficult to imagine what could if all the predictions came true.We live in a technological era, computers penetrated everywhere with all benefits they provide and all dangers they hide. However we are satisfied with them and sometimes we even thank them because they help us in communicating, studying, doing business, entertaining and saving lives in critical situations.;The growing dependence on computers in various facets of life has ignited vigorous discussions. As computer technology continues to evolve and enhance, their applications are expanding at an unprecedented rate. In the future, computers are expected to play an even more vital role in crucial sectors like healthcare, where they could assist in intricate surgeries and improve disease diagnosis. Additionally, they may be employed to manage and conserve natural resources, forecast and alleviate the impacts of natural disasters, and enrich the overall quality of life.Furthermore, computers are set to be instrumental in space exploration, facilitating more profound and comprehensive research into the universe. The advantages of this reliance on technology are numerous, including improved efficiency, accuracy, and speed. Computers empower businesses to handle vast amounts of data, enable global communication, and automate routine tasks, ultimately boosting productivity and minimizing errors.Nonetheless, this growing reliance also brings about concerns regarding privacy, security, and job displacement. As computers take on more responsibilities, the threat of cyber-attacks, data breaches, and unemployment looms larger. Additionally, excessive dependence on technology can diminish traditional skills and reduce human interaction, which may lead to social isolation and a decline in emotional intelligence.In summary, while the advantages of relying on computers are clear, it’s essential to approach this trend with a balanced viewpoint. By recognizing both the benefits and the potential risks, we can strive to leverage the capabilities of computers to enhance our lives while safeguarding our well-being and humanity. Ultimately, a careful and informed engagement with technology will allow us to fully capitalize on its advantages while addressing its downsides.
1396;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in the future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;In the last two decades cybernetics have experienced a major breakthrough .This led to the utilization of computers in nearly all parts of our daily life, from personal computers to the ones performing complicated surgeries. Surely the uptake of this technology facilitates a lot of difficult tasks but is this excessive ripping the warmth out of our lives? .Most of the daily tasks individual experiences are time and effort consuming. These two qualities could be tremendously saved by the use of computers. The average period required to prepare a decent meal for a middle-class family is around an hour to hour and a half when using traditional methods. This time could be literally reduced to half if computerized are used instead. Moreover, a busy businessman is enabled to easily close a profitable deal with just a touch highly programmed laptop while enjoying his family vacation and not having to exert an extra effort of traveling long distances in order to a deal.On the other hand, new generations are growing remarkably dependent on these modern utilities, which makes them handicapped when it comes to a cup of tea. , psychologists suggest that one of the main reasons for rate increase is the recent electric inventions. This is due to the fact that humans by nature stay emotionally healthy through socializing, but due to the importance of modern technology to maintain a financially satisfying standard of life they gradually themselves. As time passes by each of these individuals gets stuck in a vicious circle of loneliness that eventually leads to suicidal attempts especially among youngsters.In conclusion, similarly to every other invention computers have their benefits and drawbacks, I personally think it all depends upon how we use the given tools . Moderation is the key here to keep the balance and allow us to live in harmony.;The introduction of computers has transformed our lives and work in profound ways. Their applications span a wide array of fields, from business and healthcare to crime prevention and aviation. As technology evolves, it's likely that computers will take on even more sophisticated and innovative roles in the future. For example, they could play a key role in managing and analyzing vast quantities of data in disciplines like climate science and medicine, paving the way for breakthroughs and discoveries that once seemed impossible.Additionally, computers have the potential to enrich education, entertainment, and communication. Technologies like virtual and augmented reality may begin to blur the line between the digital and physical worlds, altering how we learn, interact with others, and engage in recreational activities. Furthermore, computers could enhance our infrastructure—improving traffic systems and energy grids—leading to more efficient and sustainable ways of living.However, our growing reliance on computers also brings forth concerns regarding possible risks and challenges. Dependence on technology can result in job displacement due to automation, while issues surrounding privacy and security can become more pronounced. Furthermore, the standardization of information and the proliferation of misinformation via digital platforms can negatively impact our social and cultural dynamics.In summary, while computers have significantly enhanced various aspects of our existence, it is essential to approach their advantages and limitations with a discerning mindset. As we advance in our use of technology, we must also emphasize human judgment, critical thinking, and empathy to ensure that technology complements rather than supplants human connection and creativity. By recognizing the potential risks and actively working to address them, we can leverage the capabilities of computers to foster a more promising and sustainable future for everyone.
1356;What are the difficulties of learning a foreign language, and how to overcome them?;Many people believe that learning a foreign language is a very difficult task. What are the most difficult things about learning a foreign language? What is the best way to overcome them? Explain and include your personal experience or knowledge of these problems.It is true that acquiring new language skills is by no means an easy task. Language learners might encounter several challenges such as unfamiliar accents or grammar structures a foreign language. However, in my opinion, such difficulties can be tackled by a well-rounded education system.When it comes to languages, it is undeniably crucial to get used to a native accent and intonation for effective communication. However, picking up an accurate accent can be enormously difficult, especially for adult learners because of their lack of language learning ability. If a language learner has an unrecognisable accent and intonation, they would not be understood by native speakers. On top of that, each language has different grammar and typical grammatical sequencing of words. For example, Korean sentences always end with verbs whilst English not, which means that a Korean English-learner should the correct order of words.Despite the aforementioned difficulties, I strongly believe that everyone can master a foreign language when a couple of feasible steps are taken. Firstly, it is more important than anything to start learning a new language at a young age. By incorporating foreign language programmes in the primary school curriculum, children can easily be exposed to languages of the world and eventually acquire language skills without difficulties. Secondly, the government can financially subsidise schools to run student exchange programmes that help adolescents to get experiences abroad and make friends overseas while improving their foreign language in a way.In conclusion, I believe that individuals can have difficulties in learning a new language because of different accents and unfamiliar grammar, however, these problems can be overcome by a good quality of education system subsidised by governments.The writer covered the task by talking about some difficult aspects of learning a new language and steps to overcome them. The ideas are presented in an orderly way, their logical sequencing and the use of paragraphing make this essay easy to follow. Skillful use of linking words and expressions helps the writer maintain coherence and cohesion. Word choice needs some more attention in this essay (see suggested corrections for expressions underlined in blue), however, overall this essay seems to be worthy of IELTS Band 8.;Learning a foreign language can be a challenging endeavor, often accompanied by various obstacles that impede progress. One of the main challenges is mastering the pronunciation of unfamiliar sounds and intonations. Many languages possess distinct phonetic elements that may not exist in a person's native tongue, complicating both the production and recognition of these sounds. Additionally, differences in grammar and syntax compared to one's native language can lead to confusion and difficulty in forming coherent sentences.Another considerable hurdle is building a robust vocabulary. Acquiring a new language entails memorizing a large number of words, phrases, and expressions, which can feel overwhelming. The cultural subtleties and context-specific meanings tied to certain words can further complicate understanding, resulting in misunderstandings and miscommunications.Fortunately, several strategies can help navigate these challenges. Immersing oneself in the language is essential, which can be accomplished by listening to music, watching films, and conversing with native speakers.

1348;When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers (agree/disagree);When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers for people to spend their free time. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Sample EssaySome people argue that town planners should have a preference for more parks and gyms to be created than business districts and shopping malls. While I understand the concerns of people who hold this opinion, it seems to me that shopping centers are just as important as parks and gyms in a town.There are reasons why public facilities are crucial to city inhabitants. First of all, they provide suitable spaces and equipment for people to exercise. For example, people can go jogging in the park and play tennis or basketball at the sports stadium. That helps to keep their bodies fit and it also elevates their mood during the day. Besides, parks and sports facilities are good spots for people to socialize with their neighbors. People can connect with others when they are playing sports or talking casually with passers by in the park. A harmonious relationship between residents helps build a caring and friendly neighborhood.Although parks and gyms give the town dwellers all kinds of benefits, I would like to point out the importance of shopping malls to the district. Firstly, a shopping center could make shopping more convenient for the local residents. It would enable them to easily purchase things in town and transport them home with less effort and at lower cost. They would not need to spend extra money on transportation or shipping of the goods. Secondly, a shopping mall can provide employment. Locals can find work in retail, maintenance or security of the mall, hence earning an income to support their families.In conclusion, although parks and sports facilities serve as places for exercise and social activities for city dwellers, I believe that shopping centers are equally important, since they can provide job opportunities and convenience to the town residents.This essay would score well on Task Achievement because it addresses all parts of the question, discusses reasons for and against building more parks than shopping malls and expresses the opinion of the writer. The main ideas are organized well and explained coherently. The range of vocabulary is adequate for the requirements of the task response. Overall, this essay could get Band 8 in IELTS.;I firmly believe that when planning new towns, it's crucial to prioritize the development of public parks and sports facilities over shopping centers. This strategy brings a multitude of benefits to the well-being and quality of life for residents.First and foremost, public parks and sports facilities offer essential green spaces where individuals can participate in physical activities, unwind, and connect with others. In our contemporary world, where sedentary lifestyles and urban development are on the rise, these spaces act as vital havens that enhance physical health, mental well-being, and community connectedness. By dedicating more land to these types of facilities, new towns can cultivate healthier and happier populations.Furthermore, a wealth of public parks and sports facilities can enhance the aesthetic appeal and environmental sustainability of a town. Green areas play a crucial role in improving air quality, reducing the urban heat island effect, and promoting local biodiversity. This not only elevates the living environment but also makes the town more attractive to prospective residents and visitors, thereby stimulating local economies through tourism and talent attraction.On the other hand, while shopping centers are valuable for economic activity, they do not deliver the same extensive benefits as public parks and sports facilities. The growth of online shopping indicates that the demand for large physical retail spaces may be waning. Additionally, focusing on public spaces instead of commercial developments can create more balanced and resilient communities, where residents have ample opportunities for recreation, social interaction, and personal growth.In conclusion, prioritizing the construction of public parks and sports facilities over shopping centers in new town planning is a forward-thinking approach. It tackles significant issues related to public health, environmental sustainability, and community development, ultimately leading to the establishment of vibrant, livable, and flourishing towns.
47;While many people go to university for academic study, more people should be encouraged to do vocational training because there is a lack of qualified workers such as electricians and plumbers. Do you agree or disagree?;Some believe that people should be encouraged more to study practical courses than going to university to fulfill the lack of workforce in practical areas. I agree with this proposal to some degree, because, from my knowledge, there is a lack in both fields, academic and vocational experts. Moreover, academic studies and vocational ones are equally important for every society, and not everybody can study the same thing, so both studies should be encouraged.Qualified workers and professional academics are equally needed in many parts of the world. This is because as the population grows the people's needs do it too, and this happens in all shapes and areas. While living in Argentina, I noticed the need of professionals in fields such as medicine and technology, especially robotics. In England, however, I observed the lack of plumers and carpenters. Consequently, every country needs different things.Furthermore, if strong encouragement is put on studying vocational courses only, this could be detrimental to the academic field. Essentially, both study systems are equally important. A hospital needs doctors to treat people as well as electricians to maintain the building. Besides, not everybody is good at everything. Some might be good at performing practical tasks and some good at thinking. In my family, I am the one who studied at the university, but my sister studied dressmaking. Both of us have jobs nowadays.In conclusion, I believe that the two types of studies should be stimulated. Countries worldwide are in lack of different experts, either in the vocational or academic field, hence, both workers are equally essential and needed. Besides and more importantly, not every individual can study the same subject or perform in the same area.;The idea that an increasing number of individuals should opt for vocational training instead of pursuing traditional university studies has gained notable traction in recent years. I support this viewpoint, especially given the urgent shortage of skilled labor in essential trades such as electrical work and plumbing.Vocational training equips students with practical skills and hands-on experience critical for success in these fields. In contrast, university courses often emphasize theoretical concepts, leaving graduates inadequately prepared to meet the demands of the job market. By motivating more individuals to engage in vocational training, we can help address the deficit of qualified electricians, plumbers, and other skilled professionals, which will ultimately enhance both the economy and society at large.Moreover, vocational training offers several advantages, including shorter training durations that allow students to start working sooner, along with lower tuition costs compared to university education. This makes it an appealing choice for those who want to gain a profession without incurring significant student debt. Additionally, vocational paths can lead to lucrative careers, with electricians and plumbers frequently ranking among the most sought-after and well-compensated jobs.In summary, I strongly advocate for encouraging more people to pursue vocational training. The scarcity of skilled workers in key trades poses a considerable challenge that must be tackled. By promoting vocational education, we can equip individuals with the necessary skills to bridge the job market gap, ultimately fostering the advancement and prosperity of our society. It is crucial that we shift our focus toward vocational training and ensure that adequate support and resources are available for those aspiring to enter these essential professions.
1380;Why do criminals commit another offence after being punished?;"Many offenders commit more crimes after serving the first punishment. Why is this happening, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?It is true that some criminals commit crimes again after they have been punished. While there are several reasons for this alarming trend, some effective measures can be taken by governments to tackle this problem.There are two main reasons for re-offenders. Firstly, the prison system can make the situation worse. Criminals put together in prison and they make friends with other offenders. While they are locked up in prison, they do not have much to do there, and they would exchange information about what they have done before they came to the prison or they may plan crimes with other inmates. Secondly, offenders often do not have any other means of earning money. They are poor, uneducated and lacking skills needed to maintain a job. Also, a criminal record makes finding a job difficult as people usually avoid hiring .To solve this problem, governments should focus on rehabilitation of criminals rather than punishment. Above all, prisons need vocational training which inmates to prepare for life outside the prison. They can learn practical skills such as computer programming, car maintenance and graphic design. In this way, they can be hired for a position that requires this certain knowledge and skills. Community service is another way to reform offenders. Rather than being locked up in prison with other inmates, offenders can help society and become useful to their local community, and these activities would eliminate the negative influence that prisons can have.In conclusion, it is true the one of the problems our community; it can be solved by focusing rather than punishment itself.This is a good essay. The requirements of the task statement are covered, the reasoning is logical and presented in a coherent, easy to follow way, the range of vocabulary is wide enough and the writer shows fluency and flexibility. Some minor errors in this essay include word choice and preposition errors (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows suggested corrections). Overall this looks like an IELTS Band 8 essay.";The issue of recidivism, where individuals commit new offenses after serving their sentences, is a complex and nuanced problem. Although punishment is designed to deter criminal behavior, many convicted individuals reoffend after completing their sentences. Several factors contribute to this ongoing cycle.A key factor is that punishment, particularly incarceration, often fails to tackle the root causes of criminal behavior. Many offenders face issues such as poverty, lack of education, or substance abuse, which are not sufficiently addressed by imprisonment alone. Without adequate rehabilitation and support, these individuals are at a higher risk of returning to their previous behaviors upon reentering society.Moreover, the criminal justice system frequently lacks effective rehabilitation programs. While the primary aim of punishment is to prevent crime, many correctional facilities do not provide the necessary resources and support to help offenders reform and successfully reintegrate into their communities. Consequently, many individuals leave prison without the skills or support needed to lead lawful lives, which increases the chance of reoffending.Additionally, social factors like poverty, unemployment, and social isolation significantly influence recidivism rates. Released offenders often encounter substantial obstacles when trying to reintegrate, including challenges in securing employment, housing, and rebuilding social connections. Without a supportive environment and viable rehabilitation prospects, overcoming the cycle of crime becomes exceedingly difficult.In summary, the reasons behind reoffending are complex and deeply intertwined with individual circumstances, societal influences, and systemic issues. To effectively combat recidivism, it is crucial to address the underlying causes of criminal behavior, implement robust rehabilitation programs, and assist offenders in their transition back into society. By embracing a more comprehensive approach to crime and punishment, we can strive to break the cycle of recidivism and foster safer, more equitable communities.
1400;With all the problems in the world today, spending money on space exploration is a complete waste. The money could be better spent on other causes.;, every day, every year, celebrates its achievements in space exploration. However, it is now the time to question how meaningful these blasts are.First, until all urgent and important matters of the globe have been solved, money on space exploration is meaningless. It at all to invest millions of dollars researching and producing foods for astronauts (for space exploration purpose), while every day thousands of people are starving. Furthermore, the discovery of outer space only serves a minor group of people if the majority well-educated. do no even know how to prevent common threatening diseases such as AIDS and lung cancer.Then, some may argue that the purpose of space exploration to discover new lands, new energy resources or to deter potential threat to . Nevertheless, is it effective to do so while other alternatives are available? yet effectively used. New energy resources (e.g. solar and nuclear energy) have not yet been widely-used. Threats of plagues have not yet been deterred. All of these tasks that haven’t been tackled yet require money. That is why costly space discovery programs are a waste of resources.In a nutshell, people should only invest in space exploration provided that urgent and important matters mentioned earlier in this essay have been solved. Also, purposes of space exploration campaigns should be studied carefully and other alternatives should be considered before the money is wasted.;The idea that funding space exploration is entirely futile has sparked debate for many years. Given the multitude of issues facing our world, including poverty, hunger, and disease, it’s easy to understand why some may regard space exploration as an unnecessary expense. Nonetheless, the advantages of space exploration significantly surpass the costs associated with it, and investing in this area can profoundly influence our everyday lives.To begin with, space exploration has resulted in a variety of technological innovations that enhance our daily existence. For example, innovations like memory foam, advanced water purification systems, and GPS technology emerged from space research. These developments not only have improved our quality of life but have also been the foundation for new industries and job creation. Additionally, space exploration has deepened our understanding of both our planet and the cosmos, equipping us to tackle critical challenges such as climate change and natural disasters more effectively.Furthermore, investing in space exploration can yield long-term benefits for humanity. As we confront serious issues like overpopulation and resource depletion, space exploration could offer viable solutions. The prospect of exploring and possibly colonizing other planets could ensure the survival of our species while opening up new avenues for growth and development. Moreover, space initiatives can promote international collaboration and diplomacy, as countries unite to pursue shared objectives beyond our planet.In summary, although it’s undeniable that many urgent problems require our attention here on Earth, the merits of space exploration justify continued investment. Instead of perceiving it as a financial burden, we should recognize it as an essential aspect of our pursuit of knowledge, innovation, and progress. By maintaining our commitment to space exploration, we can advance technological breakthroughs, confront global challenges, and secure a promising future for humanity.
1312;With the increase in computer use, many people feel that schools do not need to put the emphasis that they used to on basic handwriting skills or mental mathematics skills.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;In recent years, computer use around the world has increased drastically. As a result technological equipment is used increasingly in schools around the world. Many people question therefore whether schools should put much emphasis on teaching students basic handwriting skills and mental mathematics skills.The use of technological equipment in lessons has increased since the onset of the digital age. Nearly all professions around the world involve computer use and even the simplest tasks are carried out via electronic equipment. Hence, it is important for students to learn how to use technology correctly for their future careers. Electronic devices also offer various learning advantages, as notes and assignments can be completed much faster and more neatly using these tools.Nonetheless, the practical skills such as using and holding a pen correctly are likewise vital for future careers. For that reason, students have to be taught at early ages how to carry out simple tasks using basic skills, such as writing. It is also essential that a student develops neat handwriting, as in the case of a technological problem the student will have to write by hand. Furthermore, final exams are typically written by hand and thus the student must develop the basic skill of holding a pen and writing with it. Mathematics skills are no different. People will not always have a device with them to carry out calculations and the ability to do arithmetic in the head is a vital skill for operating in today’s world.In conclusion, I personally believe that schools should keep a balance between using practical skills and using electronic equipment to carry out certain tasks by having student submit assignments created electronically, yet also by having them complete assignments by hand in class and without computers or calculators. This balance is important, as if the focus lies only on one of the two aspects, the student will face problems later on in life.;The growing presence of computers in our lives has ignited a discussion regarding the relevance of traditional skills like handwriting and mental arithmetic in education. While some believe these skills are becoming obsolete, I hold a different view. I contend that the significance of handwriting and mental math extends beyond their practical use in a tech-centric world.To begin with, handwriting is a vital skill that aids cognitive development, especially in children. Studies have demonstrated that writing by hand can enhance memory, language abilities, and creativity. For example, research indicates that students who take handwritten notes generally perform better in exams compared to those who use laptops. This is attributed to the fact that handwriting engages the brain more fully, leading to improved retention and comprehension of material. Additionally, handwriting serves as a unique form of self-expression and can provide therapeutic benefits, fostering mental well-being and emotional intelligence.Similarly, mental math skills remain important in our daily lives, even with the prevalence of calculators and digital devices. The ability to carry out basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division mentally allows individuals to make quick calculations and estimates, which are essential in various real-world contexts. For instance, when shopping, being able to compute the total cost of items, including taxes and discounts, enables consumers to make informed decisions. Moreover, mental math enhances problem-solving capabilities, logical reasoning, and analytical skills—all of which are highly sought after in numerous careers.In conclusion, despite the transformative impact of computers on our lifestyle and work, I firmly believe that foundational skills in handwriting and mental arithmetic remain crucial for cognitive growth, self-expression, and practical use. Educational institutions should prioritize these skills to provide students with a solid base for future achievements, regardless of our increasing dependence on technology. By finding a balance between traditional skills and digital literacy, we can prepare future generations to be well-rounded, adaptable, and competent in an ever-evolving world.
1303;With the scale of globalisation today, it would be of unquestioned benefit to have a single world currency.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Globalisation has become a significant aspect of the world’s modern economy, with countless industries and businesses expanding in various countries. This has led to the debate of developing a world currency with many people believing it could drastically help further develop economies and assist in the development of many countries.A worldwide currency could bring on effects similar to when Euro was developed for Europe. Trade could be significantly encouraged, as there would be no exchange rate fluctuation risks between different currencies. Moreover, tourists would not need to exchange money when travelling.However, there are certain risks to a global currency, which definitely do not make it an “unquestioned benefit”. Countries in debt would not be able to lower their currency value to make consumer goods more desirable, which could develop into a severe economic issue. For example, the US regulated its interest rates to increase the money resources in order to diminish the effect of a recent recession. Also economic problems, such as in Greece, have actually been made worse by the use of the common Euro. If applied worldwide, many countries’ economies could be very similarly negatively impacted. Finally, many countries around the world do not have a stable enough economy to be able to enter a common currency. If weaker countries were to adopt a world currency, this could be disastrous to their economy and to the economies of other countries using the same currency.In conclusion, the extent to which a global currency would be beneficial is quite low. It seems to me that the risks outweigh the benefits, as if a country were to lose economic stability, the world would be impacted as well. For that reason, I feel that in present circumstances, it is best to have separate currencies to protect countries from economic recession.;The concept of a unified global currency has gained considerable traction in recent years, particularly in light of the expanding scope of globalization. While the idea may appear to offer a straightforward and efficient solution for facilitating international trade and commerce, I have reservations about the notion that it would undoubtedly yield significant advantages.On one hand, a global currency could simplify cross-border transactions, erase exchange rate uncertainties, and lower transaction expenses. This could foster greater trade, investment, and overall economic growth. For example, the Euro, which serves as a single currency for 19 out of 27 European Union member states, has already enhanced economic integration and trade within the region. A similar outcome could potentially be achieved on a worldwide level.Conversely, adopting a single world currency would entail relinquishing monetary autonomy for individual nations. National governments would lose the ability to pursue independent monetary policies, which could hinder their responsiveness to domestic economic challenges. A relevant case is the European Central Bank's monetary policy, which has faced criticism for prioritizing the interests of larger economies like Germany at the expense of smaller ones, such as Greece. This concern could be magnified on a global scale with a single currency.Moreover, establishing a world currency would necessitate a considerable degree of international collaboration, which can often be difficult to realize. The complexities involved in implementing such a system, coupled with the possible political and economic tensions that could arise, should not be overlooked. In summary, while a unified global currency presents certain advantages, its rollout would warrant thorough examination of the potential disadvantages and difficulties. Consequently, I contend that the benefits of a single world currency are not entirely beyond question, and a more nuanced perspective on international monetary policy is essential.
1295;With the vast increase in online resources today, libraries with print books are not a necessity for today’s society.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is indeed true that digital resources today far outstrip what can be put and stored in print books. Almost any kind of book can now be accessed digitally and those that can’t be will soon be changed to a digital format. Some people, therefore, believe that libraries with print books are no longer needed.If one looks at this issue dispassionately, it seems far more logical that people now should only read books digitally. It only requires a single computer or electronic reader and an individual can have access to the history of literature and works on all other fields. The costs involved with setting, typing, printing and distributing print books would practically disappear and this would make things more convenient and much cheaper. An actual library building would be totally unnecessary, as all one would need would be a ‘virtual library’ as a website and all works could be accessed through this portal. There would not even be any need to leave the house to gain access to anything one needed. This would seem to be the most logical way of proceeding.Logic, however, is not always the best approach to everything. Print books have a long history with humanity and our relationship with real books is not something that can be changed overnight. Many people, including younger readers, feel that there is something special about having a book with real paper and needing to turn pages. There will therefore for the time being be a future for print books and libraries.Libraries will continue to be especially important, as not all older people use computers and e-readers as much as the younger generation. They will still want to read print books and the library is a cheap and convenient place to find them. In addition, if only a few books in print are available in the future, libraries might be one of the few places where they might be accessed. Another purpose that libraries serve is acting as community centres that organise events, education and childcare. Ironically, libraries also provide computers and Internet access for people who cannot afford their own.In spite of the seeming dominance to come of digital books, I feel that there is and will be a place for libraries with print books. This state of affairs might change in the future, but at present, they are important community resources.;I partially disagree with the notion that libraries filled with print books are no longer essential in today’s society. Although the internet offers an extensive array of information at our fingertips, print books and libraries continue to play a vital role.To begin with, libraries create a distinctive learning atmosphere that nurtures a passion for reading and education in individuals of all ages. The tactile experience of handling a book, turning its pages, and exploring new authors and subjects is unmatched. Additionally, libraries provide a tranquil space conducive to studying, researching, and focusing, which can often be hard to find in homes or digital settings.Furthermore, not all information is accessible online, and even when it is, its reliability can be questionable. In contrast, print books are typically well-researched and meticulously edited, offering trustworthy sources of information. Many classic literary works, historical documents, and academic journals exist solely in print, thus establishing libraries as invaluable resources for researchers and academics.Finally, libraries are crucial in advancing literacy, education, and social inclusivity within communities. They grant free access to books, educational initiatives, and various resources, making them particularly important for underprivileged and marginalized groups. For example, many libraries offer literacy programs for children, language courses for immigrants, and job training resources for those seeking employment.In summary, while digital resources have undoubtedly enhanced information access, libraries rich in print books remain indispensable in contemporary society. They offer a unique learning environment, reliable information sources, and foster social inclusion and education. Therefore, I firmly believe that libraries will continue to be essential, complementing online resources and delivering invaluable services to their communities.
1392;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Capital punishment is always associated with ignorance and intolerance. In fact, we must acknowledge that some people disagree with this kind of penalty, but others vote in its favor. Portugal was the first European country to end this kind of penalty. Since the 19th century, tolerance and respect for life important values. Moreover, we can affirm that remains under the same codes. Maybe because of a religious view point, the respect for life is a typical value in the Old Catholic world.Those who are in favor of capital punishment mostly live in developing countries. However, this is not just an image of the Third World countries. Actually, the USA is one country where this kind of punishment has its rates of application. The state of Texas, in particular, is at the top, supporting this measure against crime, especially those involving serial killers and crimes against children. In a society dominated by fear and government control, it is foreseen that this penalty will continue .Maybe this is not a simple question. As we can see there are several values here and of course cultural behavior. The roots of the question are religious, cultural, ethical and even geographical. The world is divided and the law systems show this division. The solutions, however can lead us to other questions concerning revenge and justice. better to kill a person because of his crimes? Can we admit that a life sentence could be a much better sentence? In fact, rehabilitation is the right way especially with an accurate psychological evaluation first. Some people are lost forever, and in my opinion some murderers and other criminals will suffer more in jail. In this sense, capital punishment is an easy way out.;"The belief that capital punishment is necessary for curbing violence in society has been a point of contention for centuries. Some contend that the death penalty is vital for maintaining law and order, while others argue that it fails to significantly impact violent crime rates. I personally reject the assertion that our safety diminishes and violence increases in the absence of capital punishment.Firstly, studies have demonstrated that there is no definitive evidence supporting the idea that capital punishment deters violent crimes. In fact, numerous countries that have abolished the death penalty have experienced reductions in violent crime rates. For example, since Canada eliminated capital punishment in 1976, it has consistently seen falling homicide rates. This indicates that factors such as socio-economic status, education, and effective law enforcement are more influential in managing violence.Secondly, capital punishment is frequently viewed as a cruel and inhumane measure that contradicts human rights. There is also the grave concern regarding the potential for executing innocent individuals, as systemic errors can lead to wrongful convictions. Moreover, rather than breaking the cycle of violence, capital punishment may perpetuate it; by taking a life, the state mirrors the very violence it seeks to combat.In conclusion, although capital punishment may be intended as a means to manage societal violence, I believe its claimed effectiveness is exaggerated. Instead, governments should concentrate on tackling the root issues that fuel violence, such as poverty, unemployment, and insufficient education. By addressing these underlying causes, we can foster a safer and more secure society without resorting to the death penalty."
1430;Without capital punishment our lives are less secure and crimes or violence increase. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Serious crimes need capital punishment so that the are unable to get involved in the crime in the future. However, they want to stop the acts of violation in the future then it would be better to .Overall, I agree with the fact that punishment is the way to avoid the and hence our lives become more secure. If the wrongdoer wants to be a good and there is a particular financial or personal problem that led him to the wrong way, then it would be the nice option to forgive him and try to solve the problem he . Although by this way, some bad may become effective of the society but some do not bring themselves to the right path because they are . The person that involved in the crime and never to stop the law-breaking act should be punished in extremely serious way. However, it totally depends on the nature of crime. Some to a capital punishment and some may require a small penalty. The law-making institutions are responsible to bring the bad man to the right level of punishment that he deserves. If there is weak legislation to properly handle the offender, it may for the good . The government should be the responsible authority to provide a secure and better state to live. Laws should be implemented and executed in the most proper way that not allow the offender to commit violent acts or to break the law in any way and to any extent. To sum up, it is the responsibility of the state to stop people involved in crime. It may be done through solving the problems of the people that led them to commit that act or by the punishment accordingly.Where are the paragraphs? This is a good essay; however there are many small mistakes that might cost you dearly. There are also several unclear expressions and grammatical errors.";The assertion that the absence of capital punishment leads to increased insecurity in our lives and higher rates of crime and violence is a highly debated topic. While some proponents claim that capital punishment acts as a deterrent to crime, others argue that it is ineffective in reducing criminal behavior. I find myself partially disagreeing with this assertion.On one hand, the presence of capital punishment may instill fear in potential offenders, causing a reduction in violent crimes. The threat of facing the death penalty could deter individuals from engaging in serious criminal activities. Moreover, executing dangerous criminals might enhance community safety by removing them from society.Conversely, numerous studies indicate that capital punishment does not necessarily correlate with lower crime rates. In fact, some nations that have eliminated the death penalty have experienced declines in crime statistics, pointing to the importance of other elements such as socioeconomic factors, education, and effective law enforcement in influencing crime levels. Additionally, the risk of wrongful convictions and executions underscores systemic flaws in the justice system that can lead to the tragedy of innocent lives lost.In summary, while capital punishment might exert some deterrent influence, it is not a comprehensive solution for reducing crime or enhancing public safety. A more holistic approach that tackles the underlying causes of criminal behavior, including poverty, inadequate education, and social inequality, is essential for fostering a safer society. Thus, I largely disagree with the statement, as capital punishment is not a primary determinant of our personal security or the prevalence of violent crime.
163;Write about the following topic.Although there are a lot of translation software available, learning a language could still be advantageous. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people claim that language knowledge has still benefited inspite of appearance of applications and websites providing translation in real time. Modern special software is able to give quite quality translation into different languages, and it seems that it will soon replace the translators and will get rid of necessity to learn new languages. However, in my opinion, there are still some essential advantages to know foreign languages.First of all, any language is so complicated and constantly changing system that it is impossible to automized translation process to keep all senses. For instance, if you interlocutor creates a joke based on words game, it will unlikely recognise by AI. Thus, it is too hard to teach a computer to uderstand all meanings that you want to provide.Another important aspect of learning languages is knowing new cultures. Language is the great source for understanding other nations and countries. If you use online translator, you will never know the origine of some idioms or phrases that contain culture code.Moreover, learning new language is a tool of training your brain. It helps to develop memory and imagination. For instance, people didn't refuse studying maths after calculation device had been invented, because it is still important to understand how it works and it is necessary for developing other sciences.Finally, there is a lot of places and occasions when you do not have internet access. Then online translators are not available. But if you need help or ask a path being abroad, it is better to know at least some phrases. Otherwise, you can occur in unpleasant situation.To sum up, I definitely agree the statement that learning languages is essential in spite of techology progress. Although artificial intelligence is able to translate everything you want, it is crucial to continue learning languages in order to understand all sense and meanings in conversation with foreigners, to know new cultures and understand their peculiarities and, of course, to make your brain work.;The emergence of translation software has certainly made it easier to communicate across different languages. Nevertheless, learning a language remains highly advantageous. I firmly believe this, as mastering a language provides a wealth of benefits that extend well beyond simple translation.To begin with, learning a language allows individuals to grasp the subtleties and cultural context of communication, which are often overlooked by translation tools. For example, when engaging with native speakers, an understanding of idioms, phrases, and expressions can significantly enhance relationship-building and help prevent misunderstandings. This is especially crucial in professional arenas like business or diplomacy, where the nuances of language can greatly influence results.Additionally, acquiring a language boosts cognitive skills, including memory, problem-solving, and the ability to juggle multiple tasks. Studies have indicated that bilingual individuals often demonstrate enhanced executive functions and experience a slower onset of age-related cognitive decline. Furthermore, learning a language can expand one's perspective and worldview, promoting empathy and tolerance.Moreover, while translation software can assist with basic communication, it frequently falls short with more intricate or specialized materials, such as technical documents, literature, or poetry. For instance, translating a novel or a complex manual necessitates a profound understanding of the language, along with its nuances and cultural references, which can only be truly appreciated by someone who has learned the language intimately.In summary, even though translation software serves its purpose, the advantages of learning a language are extensive, ranging from improved cognitive functions to deeper cultural insight and expanded professional horizons. As technology advances, the importance of language acquisition will only become more pronounced, making it a vital skill for anyone looking to connect with the global community.

Why are more people choosing to have operation to change the way they look? Do you think this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;A greater number of individuals opted for plastic surgery to enhance the physical outlook. What could be the reason behind the increasing number of people opting for cosmetic surgery to deter their appearance.In my opinion the main reason why cosmetic surgery is in demand nowadays is because society has set a certain standard that physical appearance will be the fastest ticket to stand out in the crowd. Second is it boosts confidence to people with low self esteem.The favorable outcome is not as much the adverse effect to the individuals. Example, the fastest way to reduce wrinkles on the face is to get Botox treatment. It lasts 3-4 months, after that it needs continuous medication to maintain what has been changed. It takes a lot of money to satisfy the demands of the society. On top of that repetition of pain and recovery during and after the surgery.There are numerous natural ways to enhance beauty and confidence. Contentment, exercise and a healthy lifestyle are effective methods to maintain the genuine beauty of the people. Simple walking in the morning, keeping the distance from negativity and eating vegetables and fruits are the simplest methods that boost the natural glow of the body and prevent us from being sick.To conclude the essay, I think plastic surgery is not necessary to enhance physical outlook as it uses synthetic components that have harmful effects within the body.;"The growing popularity of cosmetic surgery has resulted in a rising number of individuals choosing procedures to improve their physical appearance. A key driver of this trend is the influence of social media, which often sets unrealistic beauty standards and promotes the concept of a ""perfect"" body. As a consequence, many people, particularly younger generations, feel compelled to meet these ideals, viewing cosmetic surgery as a practical solution. Additionally, advancements in medical technology have made these procedures safer and more accessible, further fueling demand.Another significant factor is the desire for self-improvement and increased confidence. Many believe that changing their appearance will enhance their self-esteem and overall quality of life. For example, some individuals may opt for surgery to address physical imperfections that have negatively affected their mental health, such as facial deformities or scarring. In these situations, cosmetic surgery can have a profoundly beneficial effect on an individual’s well-being.However, I argue that the increasing allure of cosmetic surgery is largely problematic. The beauty standards promoted by the media are often unattainable and unhealthy, fostering a culture of dissatisfaction with one's natural looks. Moreover, the risks and potential complications associated with cosmetic surgery can be significant, and the long-term effects on mental health remain largely unexplored. Ultimately, an overemphasis on physical appearance can overshadow more meaningful aspects of a person’s character and identity. In summary, while cosmetic surgery can offer certain advantages, the escalating trend of altering one’s appearance is a troubling issue that underscores societal pressures and unrealistic beauty ideals."
469;Write about the following topic.Bullying is a big problem in many schools.What do you think are the causes of this? What solutions can you suggest?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Most children are facing one form of bullying or the other in our schools on daily basis world wide. It is becoming a serious problem and there is a need to solve this. In this essay, we would be considering two causes and possible ways to solve these.First of all, the rate at which children bullying each other in the school environment is rising. One major cause is that bullying breeds bullying, children who are faced with physical, mental and emotional abuse from homes tend to transfer their fustrations on their peers. They think that is how one is supposed to live, exacting authority to gain superiority on weaker peers in school. Another is children who has low self esteem, such students feels threatened over their classmates they taught to be more intelligent or having better physical appearance than them.Although, there are several causes of bullying, teachers should be taught how to identify children who are from abusive homes and inform the appropriate authority. These students would taken away from such toxic environment early and they would be sent for some pschological therapy. Meanwhile, education is also a key factor especially for children who have low self esteem. This should be done by forms such as role plays, presentation and drama, where these students are taught how to have self love and accepting what they can not change on their self.In conclusion, children from abusive homes and those who have low self esteem are some of the reasons for bullying. I recommend that early identification of abusive children and education is some of the ways we can solve these problems.;Bullying remains a widespread and enduring challenge in many schools around the globe, posing serious risks to students' emotional and psychological health. The roots of bullying are intricate and varied, arising from a blend of individual, social, and environmental influences. A significant factor is the quest for power and control, which some students assert over their peers through intimidation and aggressive behavior. Additionally, social media has become a major contributor, providing a platform for anonymous and widespread bullying, making it harder for victims to find refuge.Moreover, societal expectations and pressures can fuel bullying behavior. In situations where competitiveness and aggression are celebrated, students may feel pressured to establish superiority over others. The absence of effective supervision and intervention from school authorities can also encourage bullies, allowing them to act without fear of consequences.To combat this issue, a range of solutions can be adopted. First, schools should implement and strictly enforce comprehensive anti-bullying policies that acknowledge and address all types of bullying. This includes training teachers and staff to recognize and intervene in bullying incidents promptly. Furthermore, educational programs that promote empathy and respect can cultivate a more inclusive and supportive school environment. Encouraging open lines of communication between students, teachers, and parents is also vital, enabling victims to report incidents safely without fear of retribution.From my personal experience, I have witnessed the beneficial effects of peer support groups and counseling services in schools. These programs not only offer victims a secure environment to express their experiences but also provide bullies an opportunity to comprehend the damage they inflict and to alter their behavior. By tackling the underlying causes of bullying and implementing these strategies, we can strive toward creating safer and more nurturing learning environments for all students.

The rise of e-commerce has made purchasing goods on the internet not only convenient but also increasingly accessible. I believe that the benefits of online shopping significantly outweigh any downsides.One of the main advantages of online shopping is its convenience. Consumers can easily browse and buy products from the comfort of their homes at any time of the day or night. This is especially helpful for individuals with hectic schedules or those residing in remote areas where physical stores are scarce. Furthermore, online shopping enables buyers to compare prices and products across various websites, empowering them to make informed decisions and discover the best bargains.Another noteworthy benefit is the extensive selection of products available online, frequently surpassing what is found in brick-and-mortar stores. For example, online platforms like Amazon feature an impressive array of books, including rare or hard-to-locate editions. Additionally, shopping online minimizes the need for travel, leading to time and cost savings while also reducing carbon footprints.While some critics may contend that online shopping lacks the personal touch and immediate gratification of visiting a physical store, many online retailers have developed effective customer service measures, facilitating easy returns, refunds, and inquiries. Based on my own experience, online shopping has proven to be a smooth and efficient process, with numerous retailers offering dependable delivery and competitive rates.In summary, the benefits of online shopping—such as convenience, accessibility, and a vast array of products—far outweigh any drawbacks. As technology continues to advance and online retailers enhance their offerings, it is likely that online shopping will solidify its position as a dominant force in the retail sector.
515;Write about the following topic.Cohabitation is believed to bring huge advantages for young people since it enables them to fully understand each other before deciding to get married.Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many people believe it may be advisable for couples to live together before getting married, as it may lead to a smoother relationship after they have married.I tend to agree with such opinions, as I find the arguments that usually support them to be quite reasonable. For example, it is commonly said that people act differently when they are at home and when they are outside. People instinctively tend to be more relaxed and off-guard when at home, whereas in social situations they usually make an effort, even if unconsciously, to be more likable and to conceal the less agreeable aspects of their personality from others, even their partners. Because of this, it is usual to hear that one does not truly know someone until one has lived with that person.In extreme cases, cohabitation before marriage could even prevent couples from entering into a marriage that is bound to fail and will lead to unhappiness. Considering this possibility seems reasonable, as marriage is not only an emotional bond, but also a legal one, and undoing it is usually upsetting, time-consuming and costly.Another reason I find cohabitation before marriage to be a sensible choice is that, as minor disagreements and conflicts are usually inevitable during the first months of cohabitation, it is preferable to pass through that stage before getting married than to add such problems to a period which in itself can already be stressful, such as the few weeks before the ceremony and the weeks following.What I have said up to this point reflects my opinion, but it must be noted I did not put any of it into practice when I got married. Indeed, my wife and I decided to move in together only a few weeks before the ceremony. This decision was due to the fact that her family is quite old-fashioned, and moving in together before would undoubtedly have caused them pain, even if we had our reasons for doing so and they would have understood them. No degree of persuasion would have avoided or removed such pain. We found the long-term benefits of a stable and close relationship with her family to be more important than the discomfort of not moving in together, and we ultimately decided to do it only once the ceremony was planned.;In recent years, the idea that cohabitation offers significant advantages to young couples has garnered substantial attention. I wholeheartedly agree with this perspective, as sharing a living space before marriage can enhance mutual understanding between partners. By living together, couples can gain important insights into one another’s daily routines, habits, and lifestyle preferences, ultimately leading to a more informed assessment of their compatibility.One of the key benefits of cohabitation is that it enables couples to experience their relationship in a real-world context. For example, they can figure out how to manage finances, divide household responsibilities, and resolve conflicts in a more intimate and practical setting. This process helps them to identify potential challenges and collaboratively work through them, thereby strengthening their relationship. Additionally, living together allows partners to evaluate their long-term compatibility, which can help reduce the likelihood of divorce or dissatisfaction in the future.Furthermore, cohabitation can foster emotional growth and independence. By living as a couple, young partners can develop crucial life skills such as communication, compromise, and conflict resolution. These skills are essential for a healthy marriage, and cohabitation provides an ideal environment for couples to cultivate them with support and love. For instance, a friend of mine who lived with her partner before getting married found that this experience deepened her understanding of the importance of communication and teamwork in a relationship.In summary, I firmly believe that cohabitation can offer numerous benefits to young individuals, allowing them to better understand each other before making a lifelong commitment. By serving as a testing ground for compatibility, encouraging emotional growth, and nurturing essential life skills, cohabitation can establish a strong foundation for a successful and fulfilling marriage.
499;Write about the following topic.Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies. To what extent do you think consumers are influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;These days, consumers often suffer from the increase of numbers of advertisements conducted by competing companies. I believe that this fact has certain negative effects on consumers' working performance as well as their private space and time. In order to protect consumers, some proposals related to protecting their information and eliminating the number of advertisements are required.The increasing number of advertisements has a negative effect on the consumers. Firstly, their working perfomance can be reduced. Obivously, when a person is working, he cannot receive a large number of advertisements, process and response them. I know a researcher who receives a lot of advertising emails from certain banksand even some scientific journal while he require time to perform many research projects. This makes him feel uncomfortable when working, thereby reducing the research's quality. Secondly, the advertisements can affect on people private space and time. For examle, when they spend time on their family after a hard working day, or even when they are sleeping. This completyly affects on the consumers, in terms of both physical and mental health.For protecting consumers, certain methods need to be proposed. Firstly, it can be implied that the consumers' information is illegal used by many companies. Therefore, an imporvement of security method can allow us to protect consumers. Secondly, eliminating the number of advertisements performed by companies and eliminating the hours for companies send advertisements are required.In conclusion, the increasing numbers of advertisements leads to certain unwanted results for consumers, such as reducing their working performance as well as their private space and time. For protecting consumers, we need to protect their personal information and eliminate the number of advertisements.;The surge of advertisements in today’s market has become an all-encompassing reality, overwhelming consumers with a multitude of competing messages from various companies. In my view, the impact of advertisements on consumer behavior is substantial. They possess the ability to shape perceptions, influence buying decisions, and even generate new desires. For example, a skillfully crafted advertisement can forge an emotional bond with consumers, increasing the likelihood that they will prefer one brand over another.Furthermore, advertisements often utilize subtle persuasion techniques, including subliminal messaging and celebrity endorsements, which can be particularly effective in swaying consumer choices. However, this influence can have negative consequences as well, as consumers might fall victim to misleading advertisements, resulting in poor purchasing choices. To protect consumers, measures such as strict advertising regulations and fact-checking could be put in place. Regulatory agencies can enforce truth-in-advertising laws, ensuring that advertisements are accurate and transparent.Additionally, it is crucial for consumers to learn how to critically assess advertisements, identifying strategies such as emotional appeals and bandwagon effects. This can be facilitated through public awareness campaigns and media literacy initiatives. Ultimately, achieving a balance between the commercial priorities of companies and the rights of consumers is vital. By implementing these strategies, we can shield consumers from manipulative advertising tactics, enabling them to make informed choices that reflect their true needs and desires. With an understanding of the potential impacts of advertisements, consumers can navigate the marketplace more wisely, while encouraging companies to adopt more ethical and transparent advertising practices.

Some people think that the closure of local business will bring about the death of local communities.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;As the huge company extends their bussiness, the local markets is dimmished to local society. This essay explains why I disagree closure of local business will bring about the death of local communities with relevant examples.First, Big company drag the new residents. I believe major company make the local communities to flourish. My cusion lived in countryside for 30 years. Every time when I visited that place, that farm land still same during the a few decades. However, recently when I dropped by there I surprised with new tall building that newly built. My cusion told me once the big supermarkert open in this neighborhood, grasp many couples or familly to live here. Eventually, that rural place's population is surged.Someone thought giant grocery's product cheap price can not compete with local product, that make local place to close. I considered it is anachromism idea. Now the customer's purchasing value is totally diffrent with previous eras. Buyer start choose organic product and eco-friendlly or morality brand. If local stores have their own unique products, which are not replace with other, such as handmade cheese and unique taste of bread, local bussiness can compete with global chain markets.In conclusion, albeit famous company expands their sites every moments, the local community can be larger by new residents settled down near local region. Also, local bussiness have specialty, community can not dismissed;The rise of supermarkets in numerous countries has contributed to the decline of small, local enterprises, raising alarms about the potential fallout for local communities. I largely agree that the shuttering of local businesses can severely affect the vibrancy of these communities.Local businesses often serve as the foundation of a community, offering distinctive products and services that embody the local culture and identity. Moreover, they generally reinvest profits within the community, ensuring that money stays local rather than flowing to distant corporate offices. In contrast, supermarkets frequently prioritize efficiency and low prices over community involvement, which can result in a loss of local uniqueness. For example, in many towns, the establishment of a supermarket has led to the closure of independent bakeries, butchers, and greengrocers, diminishing the diversity and charm of the area.Additionally, local businesses foster a sense of community and social connection since they are usually owned and managed by residents who care about the local well-being. The disappearance of these businesses can erode community spirit and lead to fewer local job opportunities. In my own town, the closing of a beloved bookstore resulted in a noticeable decline in foot traffic and created an atmosphere of emptiness in the town center.That said, some supermarkets have initiated efforts to support local suppliers and engage with the community, which can help alleviate some of the adverse effects. Still, I maintain that the loss of local businesses can significantly affect the character and cohesion of communities, and it is essential to take steps to support and preserve these unique and important elements of our social fabric.

Anyway, a lot of people think that this types of sports are very dangerous and should be banned. This essay will talk about extreme sports giving my own opinion about the idea of banning this activities because of their risks.Practicing a sport is very important for the general health of a person; a lot of people choose to practice dangerous sports, like skiing, because of the adrenaline and the sensation that it brings to you. Sports of this type can help you to go over your fear and they will help you to see life from a different perspective.Anyway, the risks that an athlete will go through are many; every year the amount of people that have injuries or, sometimes die, because of this types of activities are numerous. Especially with skiing, a person should never go alone in places that don't have the right equipment to guarantee a safe experience; many times when practicing this types of sports, athletes from all over the world decide to go over their limit going to practice in zones that are known to be dangerous or unsafe and, in this cases, the possibility of something bad to happen is high.Personally, I think that when you want to practice or experiment a sport that is extreme you should take all the right prevention to make the experience as safe as possible to avoid any injuries. Practicing sports is important but it is also fundamental to try your best to avoid injuries when practicing it. This essay talked about extreme sports and their risk, giving my own opinion at the end.";I fundamentally oppose the idea that extreme sports, like skydiving and skiing, should be prohibited due to their perceived risks. Although these activities do involve certain dangers, it's important to acknowledge that many enthusiasts take appropriate precautions and undergo extensive training to reduce the chances of accidents.A key reason to keep extreme sports accessible is that they fulfill the desire for adventure and excitement that many people seek. For instance, skydiving provides the exhilarating sensation of free-falling from significant heights, while skiing offers the chance to tackle challenging slopes amidst stunning landscapes. These pursuits not only enhance physical fitness but also contribute positively to mental health by fostering resilience and a sense of achievement.Additionally, numerous extreme sports are governed by stringent safety protocols. For example, skydiving facilities generally require jumpers to complete comprehensive training and ensure equipment is thoroughly checked before each jump. Similarly, ski resorts maintain clearly marked trails, established safety patrols, and emergency response strategies. These measures significantly mitigate the risks involved, allowing participants to enjoy these activities more safely.Moreover, proposing a ban on extreme sports represents an excessive exertion of authority, infringing on individuals' rights to choose their recreational endeavors. Many participants engage in these sports responsibly and with a clear understanding of the inherent risks. Rather than outlawing these activities, it would be more beneficial to encourage safety awareness and share best practices among those involved.In summary, while extreme sports do entail some risks, the physical and mental benefits they offer, coupled with well-enforced safety measures, far outweigh the potential dangers. Therefore, these sports should remain available for those who cherish the thrill and adventure they bring.

Say why you think this is the case and what effect this has on the individual and society in general.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Hobbies are recreational activities that are pursued away from one's school or work. They are meant to be an escape from the mundane and a way of keeping people sane and happy. Unfortunately, they have become almost a luxury in today's fast-paced world.Several reasons can account for this massive decrease in the pursuit of hobbies. One such reason is the fact that hobbies require time and money which are two very dear resources in today's world. Social sophistication and technological advancements have brought about changes in hobbies. What used to be called hobbies in the past are now considered obsolete and the new ones, including video games and virtual reality require financial commitment in their pursuit. Even if one has the money to pursue such, he or she would have to set aside time in his or her busy schedule to enjoy those hobbies. It is therefore no wonder that most people found to pursue hobbies today are either wealthy youth or comfortable pensioners.Secondly, lack of interest may be an important factor why people devote little to no time to hobbies. Most of the educated lot are taught from a tender age only to concentrate on their studies in order to secure a comfortable future for themselves. Such children are discouraged from enjoying anything away from anything extracurricular and therefore grow into hobby-less adults who work all day and do nothing else otherwise. This is seen in a lot of Ghanaian homes where doing anything other than studying after school is deemed a taboo. Consequently, many grow into adults with little humour or mirth.Moreover, many people get exhausted with school or work, which have become extremely intensive nowadays, as compared to the more laid back past. After a tiring day, most people like to crawl into their beds to catch a night-long rest only to return to their busy life the next day.This lack of hobby pursuit, though understandable, does the individual and society more harm than good. Many individuals today are being treated for one mental health or another. Hobbies are a good way to relax and destress through leisure and can go a long way to improve mental health. Its absence will only wreak havoc for the society, which will only consist of tired and apathetic individuals who could not care less about each other and their surroundings.In conclusion, it is important, albeit difficult, to pay attention to hobbies in order to improve the health and psyche of the individual and society as a whole. More effort should be geared at encouraging hobbies at school and at the work place.;The reality that fewer individuals engage in hobbies today is quite striking. In my view, this trend can be largely attributed to the demands of modern life, which often leave people with little time and energy for leisure activities. The pressures of work, family, and social obligations have resulted in a marked decrease in the pursuit of hobbies. Many find themselves overwhelmed by professional responsibilities, leading to exhaustion and scant opportunity for personal interests.Consequently, individuals are missing out on the various advantages that hobbies offer, such as stress relief, creative expression, and social interaction. A lack of hobbies can lead to feelings of stagnation and dissatisfaction, negatively impacting both mental and physical health. Additionally, without engaging in stimulating activities, individuals may experience a decline in innovation and creativity, as they miss opportunities to explore new ideas.The decline in hobby engagement also affects society at large. Hobbies often unite people, helping to build communities and strengthen social ties. Without these shared pursuits, communities risk becoming fragmented and disconnected. Moreover, this reduction in hobby participation can contribute to the erosion of cultural heritage and traditional skills, as fewer individuals partake in activities that sustain and impart cultural knowledge.For example, I’ve noticed many of my friends who once played musical instruments or pursued painting have given up these activities due to work pressures. This shift not only impacts their personal well-being but also diminishes the cultural landscape, as fewer individuals contribute to the arts. In summary, the decrease in hobby engagement is a troubling trend that has far-reaching consequences for both individuals and society. It's crucial for people to prioritize their personal interests and carve out time for hobbies to foster a healthy work-life balance and enhance the richness and diversity of our communities.
595;Write about the following topic.Group or team activities can teach more important skills for life than those activities which are done alone.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The topic of group work can be more beneficial for peoples' lives than person who tend to do some work alone or not is widely discussed across the globe. Personally, I think there are some good advantages team activities cause our life,and especially in business scenes more comfortable and productive.Initially, only one person's work is limited, compared with group activities. This means that working only one person will be able to cause some profits to some extent. On the other hand, group working will be more productive and efficient to make more sales figures. In addition, each person has a great ability. For example, some people have great communication skills and negotiations. Those people arethe most appropriate roles for sales. Furthermore, some people are good at analysing the group performance quality and making strategies. Those who are good at these activities are best for marketing team. As a result, they can focus on their strong points for work and they can divide and conquer the tasks with each other.Of course, some people are eager to work alone at their own relaxed pace and make a profit to some extent. This is less stressful they do not need to keep attention from other colleagues. But this means that they need to decide all tasks and take all responsibility. Sometimes it might be risky once they made a mistake and caused a huge deficit.Finally, there is no doubt that more than two heads are better than one. People can share their experiences and opinion to improve their group activities. If some people who are sensitive and feel pressure if some people meddle in too much. It is necessary to organize some rules that must be effective. For example, all people need to try to stay positive, avoid stating negative or swear words, and not deny one person's opinion straightforwardly and emotionally. Making a great atmosphere, saying positive words with each other, and including some humor, will lead to everyone's performance being more productive.;I wholeheartedly believe that participating in group or team activities cultivates more essential life skills than solitary endeavors. Engaging in collaborative projects has allowed me to develop invaluable competencies crucial for both personal and professional success.A key skill learned through team activities is communication. In a collaborative setting, it's important for each member to express their ideas clearly, share opinions, and listen actively. This interaction promotes open dialogue, teamwork, and conflict resolution, all of which are vital for navigating life’s challenges. For example, while working on a marketing plan for a university project, my teammates and I had to share our ideas, negotiate differences, and find compromises to reach our shared goal. This experience highlighted the significance of effective and respectful communication, a skill I now apply throughout my life.Additionally, teamwork fosters problem-solving and adaptability. Collaborating with others brings together diverse perspectives and expertise, enhancing creative approaches to problem-solving and facilitating resilience in the face of challenges. During a team sports event, I learned how to adjust to various situations, such as sudden weather changes or unexpected tactics from opponents. This adaptability has proven beneficial in managing uncertainties in both my personal and academic pursuits.Moreover, team experiences cultivate leadership, time management, and accountability. Each individual must manage their responsibilities, utilize their time wisely, and step up to lead when the situation calls for it. These competencies are applicable across all facets of life, influencing both career paths and personal relationships. In summary, I firmly assert that team activities offer a valuable platform to acquire essential life skills—such as communication, problem-solving, and leadership—that are crucial for achieving success and fostering meaningful connections.
317;Write about the following topic.In many countries large amounts of foods are wasted. Why do you think people waste food in this way? What can be done to reduce the amount of food thrown away?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, many countries are confronted with the increasing amount of waste and one of the major contributions is food wasted by people. This issue is mainly driven by an over-ordered food and misunderstanding about the method of food disposal. However, people could cease from creating food waste through the act of both restaurants and governments.To begin with, it is obvious that countries have wasted because the amount of food that people buy is more than the amount they need. The crucial factor of this behavior is that when people contemplate menus in a restaurant, they tend to order many items in order to satisfy their desire level. Eventually, a lot of food scraps are left when these people finish eating their meals. Another potential cause could be because people do not know how to deal with food scraps. As a result, they might understand that putting wasted food into a garbage is the only solution they could do. This is exemplified by statistics published by Thai waste association which demonstrate that more than a half of waste in Thailand come from household food.A possible solution for this matter could be for restaurants to fine their customers who leave some food. This policy possibly encourages customers to carefully think of the reasonable amount of food when they order. In addition, from the country’s level governments could also educate their citizens including companies in the food-service industry about how to do with food waste due to the fact that some edible items could be food for animals. For instance, authorities could give an instruction demonstrating that dogs can be fed with remaining food such as rice or bread while remaining vegetables can be food for rabbits.In conclusion, people waste food since they order food by what they want without considering the amount and most of them misunderstand about the way to dispose of food waste. Nevertheless, this concern can be coped with the penalty by restaurants as well as the guidance from governments regarding feeding animal with food scraps.;"The problem of food waste has emerged as a critical concern in numerous countries, with a significant quantity of edible food being disposed of. In my view, the primary cause of food waste is inadequate planning and poor time management in grocery shopping and meal preparation. Many individuals tend to purchase more food than they can eat, often lured by discounts and promotions, without taking into account the shelf life of the items. Moreover, the growing ""throwaway culture"" has fostered an attitude where people are inclined to discard food that is still good instead of seeking ways to utilize it.To tackle food waste, individuals can adopt several strategies. Firstly, planning meals and creating a grocery list before shopping can significantly lower the chances of over-purchasing. Secondly, using leftovers creatively can further curtail waste; for example, leftover vegetables can be transformed into a hearty soup or stew, while excess bread can be repurposed as croutons or breadcrumbs.Governments and businesses also play a crucial role in combating food waste. Stores might consider creating ""ugly fruit"" sections to sell misshapen or oddly-sized produce at reduced prices, which can decrease the amount of food rejected for cosmetic reasons. Additionally, supporting food banks and charities in redistributing surplus food to those in need is essential. In some regions, apps have been developed that enable users to purchase surplus food from restaurants and cafes at a discounted rate, cutting down on waste and benefiting local enterprises. By embracing these approaches, we can significantly diminish the volume of food discarded and foster a more sustainable and responsible food culture."
1025;Write about the following topic.In many countries, a small number of people earn extremely high salaries. Some people believe that this is good for the country, but others think that governments should not allow salaries above a certain level.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In many parts of the world, few people get a lot of money thanks to their job. It is believed by some that this is an advantage for the country, while it is thought by others that governments should put a limit above which salaries cannot be.In my opinion, I believe that not only people have to be rewarded for their performance, but also their wage salary has to be proportional to the benefits that they are leading to the country.For instance, due to the Covid a lot of people suffered several injuries which were cured only thanks to the doctors and the nurses. For this reason, since they are saving lifes everyday,it seems unbelievable the fact that they are earning much less money than football players.Another example can be found in people involved in the national security: I believe that it would be fairer if these professionals were paid more than an influencer.However, in our society this figures (such as doctors) are paid by governments through taxes, while football players or influncers gain incomes by private companies.In order to not impose an heavier taxation, politics should categorise jobs basing on their importance in the society. Hence, we will have a specific amount that these employers can earn.Thus, if these no-fundamental workers (like actors or actress) are earning more money than the precise level chosen, these will be used as funds to increase life-saving jobs' salary.In conclusion, I believe that highest salaries should exist only if we are referring to a job that is needed by everyone.;The topic of unusually high salaries received by a small segment of the population has ignited intense discussions in various nations. Proponents argue that these elevated salaries can be advantageous for the country, as they draw in top talent, fuel innovation, and stimulate economic growth. For example, major tech companies such as Google and Facebook offer exorbitant compensation packages to attract the best engineers and researchers, resulting in revolutionary innovations and substantial contributions to the global economy.Conversely, others contend that governments should establish salary caps to mitigate income inequality and foster fairness. They suggest that exorbitant salaries can create a lopsided wealth distribution, where a small elite amasses enormous fortunes while the majority struggles financially. In some instances, CEOs in certain countries earn several hundred times more than their average workers, exacerbating social and economic divides.In my view, while high salaries can promote innovation and economic expansion, it's essential for governments to adopt measures that address income inequality. Imposing salary caps may not be the most effective solution, as it risks brain drain and diminished competitiveness. A more constructive approach could involve implementing progressive taxation, where the affluent are taxed at higher rates, with the proceeds channeled into social welfare initiatives and education. This strategy would help diminish income inequality while still incentivizing innovation and diligence. Ultimately, finding a balance between attracting exceptional talent and ensuring economic fairness is vital for a nation's enduring prosperity and social harmony.
233;Write about the following topic.In some parts of the world people try to find out one's own family history. Why do people do this? Do you think it is a positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"At present, discovering one`s own family history is becoming more and more commom. In the following paragraphs, I will present the motives why people do that and the reason I strongly believe this is important and have positive effects on people.Probably the most crucial motive people search for their family`s past is to find out about any chronical diseases. One of society`s biggest concern nowadays is healthy leaving. Therefore, by knowing the family health history and genetic predisposition to a specific disease such as cancer or diabetes, one can prepare and take the appropriate mesures to prevent it or have an early treatment.Moreover, another reason people may seek for their ancestors`s history is to build a sense of belonging. Human beings need to feel welcomed and inserted into a culture; a community`s identity is as important as an individual one, as it provides people with the opportunity to grow and develop relantioships. When people know about their family history, their sense of belonging is promoted, and they can actively participate in their culture and contribute to their community.As mentioned in the previous paragraphs, people search about family history for health and cultural reasons. One and the other do impact positivily a person`s life, as being healthy and part of a community integrate people`s satisfaction about living.To summarize, one may try to find out about their family history for two main motives, one being about their health and the other one about feeling part of a community. Both reasons are important and have positive impacts on one`s life.";The quest to trace one’s family history has gained popularity in many parts of the globe. Individuals engage in this journey for a variety of reasons, mainly motivated by a wish to comprehend their heritage, cultural backgrounds, and the narratives of their ancestors. By exploring their familial past, people can achieve a stronger sense of identity and connection to their lineage. Moreover, this exploration often unveils historical events, cultural practices, and genetic information that may have been previously unknown. In my view, delving into one’s family history is a beneficial endeavor. It not only nurtures a sense of belonging and pride but also encourages cross-cultural understanding and appreciation. For example, discovering the migrations, challenges, and accomplishments of one’s ancestors can yield important insights into the social, historical, and economic contexts that influenced their lives. This knowledge can foster empathy, tolerance, and a broader understanding of the complexities of human experience. Additionally, investigating family history can yield practical advantages, such as revealing genetic tendencies to certain health issues, enabling individuals to take preventive actions. It can also result in reconnecting with distant relatives, thereby widening one’s social circle and support network. For instance, genealogy websites and DNA testing services have made it easier for people to locate long-lost relatives and uncover their ethnic backgrounds, which enhances their understanding of their place within the global community. In summary, the search for familial heritage is a valuable pursuit that provides a myriad of benefits, from personal growth and cultural enrichment to practical health and social opportunities. As more individuals explore their ancestral roots, they not only pay homage to their heritage but also help create a more interconnected and compassionate world.
987;Write about the following topic.Information technology is changing many aspects of our lives and now dominates our home, leisure and work activities.To what extent do the benefits of information technology outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;There is no doubt that these days information technology has invaded our space and dominated our home leisure and work. However, the question: is dominating our lives by this technology have a negative or positive impact on our lives? Is considered one of the most controversial issues today. In this essay, I am going to examine this phenomenon from both viewpoints.On one side of the argument, some people argue that the benefits considerably outweigh the disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is integrating technology in every aspect eases our lives and decreases hardworking. For example, advanced houses with integrated voice commands give the person the ability to achieve multiple tasks without any physical activity. Moreover, the technology allows people to connect multiple devices with an email address and control them remotely. One good illustration of that you can switch on and off your home AC while you are at work by the WIFI technology.On the other hand, it is also possible to consider it with the opposing case. It is often argued that in fact using advanced technology increase the number of unhealthy people. People often have this opinion because people become lazier, and their daily activity dramatically decreases making them prone to diseases.As we have seen, there are no easy answers to this question. On balance, however, I tend to believe that using advanced information technology should be limited to simple tasks, so at any point if a technical error happened you can resume your life without any obstacles.;The emergence of information technology has transformed numerous aspects of our daily lives, profoundly influencing our home, leisure, and work environments. Despite the drawbacks associated with this technological advancement, I strongly believe that the advantages of information technology far surpass the disadvantages.On one side, the benefits of information technology are diverse. It provides unmatched access to information, enhancing learning and education. With the internet readily available, we can gain knowledge on nearly any topic, at any time, from virtually anywhere. Furthermore, information technology has changed the way we communicate, enabling us to maintain connections with people around the world, which nurtures international relationships and collaborations. In the workplace, it has boosted efficiency and productivity, facilitating remote work and diminishing geographical barriers.Conversely, there are some downsides tied to information technology, including privacy issues, cyberbullying, and the risk of job loss due to automation. However, these challenges can be addressed through responsible practices and the establishment of strict privacy and security protocols. For instance, using robust passwords, exercising caution in online interactions, and advocating for laws that safeguard personal data can significantly mitigate the risks associated with information technology.In summary, while it is important to recognize the disadvantages that exist, I maintain that the benefits of information technology—such as improved access to information, global connectivity, and heightened work efficiency—far outweigh the negatives. With careful use and appropriate safeguards in place, information technology can continue to positively impact our lives, making it an essential asset in today’s digital landscape. By embracing this technology, we can unlock its potential to enhance our personal, social, and professional experiences.
1033;Write about the following topic.It is inevitable that traditional cultures will be lost as technology develops. Technology and traditional cultures are incompatible.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many people hold the view that traditional culture and technological development cannot coexist as the latter catch on, the former will be bound to disappear. I totally disagree with this because both can be implemented jointly by putting technology at the service of tradition and through pilot projects.To begin with, technological progress, which is making major strides in our daily lives, is the means by which local mores, custom and traditions could be brought back to life, proving they are compatible. In fact, by tapping technology to make tradition far more attractive, considerably more audience will be engaged into such activities. Bologna is a case in point, since, thanks to digital machines and drones which have supported housewives into the making of , the traditional celebration of “making pasta day ” has recently being turned into a successful events, which draws people from country as far afield as China.Another example of possible coexistence is the possibility to heighten awareness of people costumes through the creation of pilot projects which bring both habits and technology to a new whole level. This can be put into practice by setting a direct connection to cultural heritage of a specific area of the world to those who do not have access easily. To this end, many primary schools in New York have developed a project in which, owing to the ultimate high speed connection, pupils who come from abroad can learn ancient craft directly from a master located in their country of origin.To conclude, I firmly believe that traditional culture and technology development are widely compatible as the technology can positively beef up the presence of cultural traditions nowadays, so as to keep its memory Alive. In addition, pioneering projects can be implemented to underpin cultural awareness amongst youngsters.;The idea that traditional cultures will eventually vanish as technology progresses has ignited considerable discussion. While some contend that technology and traditional cultures cannot coexist, I hold a more nuanced perspective. I believe that technology has the capacity to both undermine and safeguard traditional cultures, depending on its application.On one side, technological innovations can indeed contribute to the decline of traditional cultures. The pervasive use of social media, for example, has facilitated the blending of cultural practices, as individuals increasingly embrace universal norms and values. Additionally, the growth of digital communication has diminished the relevance of traditional storytelling and cultural expressions, which could lead to their eventual fade. A case in point is the oral traditions of indigenous communities, which are endangered as younger generations turn to digital platforms for information and entertainment.Conversely, technology can also act as a vital instrument for the preservation and celebration of traditional cultures. Digital platforms offer a worldwide audience for traditional artists, musicians, and craftspeople, enabling them to display their work and connect with those who value their cultural legacy. Moreover, digital archives and museums play a crucial role in safeguarding traditional artifacts and historical records, making them more accessible and ensuring their continuity for future generations. For instance, online resources have facilitated the revival of endangered languages like Hawaiian and Maori by providing educational materials and linking learners with fluent speakers.In summary, while technology presents certain threats to traditional cultures, it is not necessarily at odds with them. By adopting technology in a thoughtful and culturally aware way, we can leverage its potential to preserve and promote traditional cultures instead of allowing them to fade. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with us to ensure that technology enriches and diversifies our cultural heritage rather than diminishing it.
1117;Write about the following topic.It is now possible for scientists and tourists to travel to remote natural environment, such as the South Pole.What are advantages and disadvantages of this development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Thanks to the development of our society, individuals can now travel to isolated areas, namely the South Pole. Never has this area been exploded before so researchers could discover crucial information for thesis and tourists could appreciate a fabulous landscape. However, discovering those faraway environments could increase environment-related issues such as climatic change.South Pole is a place which has ever seen human activities before, and it seems to have numerous discoveries to make. Indeed, scientists which fauna and flora are the current studies, could find new mode of the marine life and discover new species. Moreover, people who are interested in travelling to South Pole might now do it, children who dreamed about polar animals could see them. Thus, the tourism should create new jobs and develop economic growth.Nevertheless, as each breakthrough that the society does, there are repercussions. In this case, the harmful effect of this discovery is global warming because when humans go somewhere, they let a carbon footprint which directly changes the environment. For instance, if individuals had to travel to South Pole, they would only use air or marine transport such as cruise ship which pollute the area with greenhouse gases. As a result, those greenhouse gases can warm nature which, unfortunately, would melt the ice and have a detrimental impact on the landscapes. As a consequence, in the forthcoming decades, this panorama may disappear. Thereby, if scientists want to study this natural area, they could not or in a limited way.To conclude, the advantages could be to discover new landscapes and how species can live in this hostile area. However, just going into this remote natural environment could destroy it before discovering something.;Technological advancements have enabled both scientists and tourists to visit isolated natural areas, such as the South Pole. This trend brings about both benefits and drawbacks.On one hand, the benefits of exploring remote natural environments are plentiful. For researchers, these locations offer a unique opportunity to conduct studies and gather data in pristine areas, potentially leading to significant discoveries. For example, scientists have been able to investigate the impact of climate change on the Antarctic ice sheet, a crucial factor in understanding global warming. Additionally, tourism in these regions can foster conservation initiatives and bolster local economies.Conversely, this development also presents serious challenges. An uptick in tourism can result in environmental damage and pollution, jeopardizing the ecosystems that researchers aim to study. A notable case is the growing number of tourists in the Galapagos Islands, where the introduction of invasive species threatens the islands' unique biodiversity. Moreover, the high costs associated with travel to such remote locations often restrict access to a privileged few, further entrenching social and economic disparities.In summary, while the ability to travel to remote natural environments offers substantial benefits, such as advancing scientific research and supporting conservation, it also poses significant challenges like environmental harm and social inequality. It is crucial to find a balance between encouraging tourism and protecting these areas to ensure that the benefits of exploration are distributed fairly and sustainably.
141;Write about the following topic.Many governments think that economic progress is their most important goal. Some people,however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;This is a world that fast developing and full of pollution.there is a worldwide problem whether economic progress is the most important goal when the other types problem are increasing. In my word is economic progress is important than other problems.Firstly,this is an economic world. human life condition is base on their income. For example,there have a village with poor people. They might working hard for live but they must have no time to think about other goal. This is reason why the governments to develop social economic . it is not uncommon that government have no money to solve the problem that environment pollution and others.Second, although economic progress is necessary for people but it also lead to other problems. With the increasing income it might need more resources to build the country. If it not solved correctly that give rise to more problems. The other types of progress will have a good developing when the economic progress finished and the government get enough money.Overall , i prefer economic progress to other types of progress. The better life come from money and the solution of the other types problem are come from the good economy.;The idea that economic advancement is the primary objective of governments has sparked significant discourse among academics and policymakers. Many governments, on one side of the debate, prioritize economic growth, viewing it as essential for a nation’s prosperity and its competitive edge in the global arena. A robust economy facilitates improved infrastructure and enhances living standards, which can lead to longer life expectancies, better education, and superior healthcare systems. Countries such as South Korea and Singapore exemplify this, having experienced substantial economic growth that has dramatically elevated the quality of life for their populations.Conversely, others contend that social, environmental, and cultural development are equally vital for a nation’s overall health. Critics argue that focusing excessively on economic growth can result in environmental harm, increased social inequality, and cultural uniformity. For instance, Bhutan and Costa Rica emphasize gross national happiness and environmental sustainability, respectively, achieving a distinctive equilibrium between development and the preservation of their natural and cultural legacies.In my view, although economic advancement is important, it should not overshadow other critical facets of development. A balanced perspective that integrates social, environmental, and cultural progress alongside economic growth is more sustainable and equitable over time. This comprehensive approach fosters more resilient and fulfilled communities. The Nordic countries exemplify this balance, regularly ranking high in happiness and quality of life, demonstrating that economic success and other forms of progress can coexist and complement each other. Consequently, governments should aim for a holistic development strategy that equally prioritizes the health of the economy and the well-being of society as a whole.
555;Write about the following topic.Many parents today organise extra classes for their children after school and at the weekends.Do you feel that this is a worthwhile thing to do or do you feel children have enough education at school?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays educational institutions are equipped with devices that were unimaginable only a few years ago, which offer many opportunities to children to study every kind of subject. In other words, the technology introduced in schools helps many children to learn various subjects with different gadgets, such geography, art, maths by computers or history by means of audio-visual-techniques. However, I believe that children thanks to these appealing methods of learning have enough education and they need some time to unwind and experience their life with other activites.To begin with, apply children to extra classes at the weekends has become an issue of debate by many people. I hold firmly to the belief that children after schools need to dedicate their free time on sports. However, sports and other physical activities help young people to enhance their concentration, self-esteem and cognitive skills, social skills with their peer group. For example the most popular and suitable to children are sports with teams, such as football, basketball etc... where children could learn how to collaborate with other mates and the leadership skills gained in sports can help kids to excel in school, life and in the workplace, such as organising a good teamwork.On the other hand, there are few parents who argue that children need to attend extra classes at schools during the weekends. For instance, the world is still facing a global pandemic of covid-19, which caused many problems of attendency of students in many educational institutions due to various measures introduced. However this led many students to lazyness and reduction of methods of gaining knowledge, because it is widely believed that online lessons are not interactive as the lessons in presence. Moreover using continously a technological gadget for hours may cause distraction and negative mental effects. So the better solution for some people is to let their children do extra classes in presence in order to make up for the hours lost during the online lessons.To sum up, children need to experience different activities afterschool in order to have a good educational career. However some parents consider the extra classes an acceptable opportunity to not lose the methods of studying.;The growing trend of parents arranging additional classes for their children beyond regular school hours has become increasingly prevalent. While some believe this approach gives children a competitive advantage, others contend that it places excessive stress on them. I believe that whether to enroll a child in extra classes should be based on their unique needs and circumstances.On one side, extra classes can greatly benefit children who either need further assistance or wish to explore a subject in more detail. For example, a child who is having difficulty with math might find extra tutoring sessions helpful for improving their understanding and performance. Likewise, children with a passion for subjects like music or art can take additional classes to refine their skills and foster their creativity.Conversely, some children may already receive a thorough education at school and may not need extra lessons. In such instances, attending additional classes could lead to exhaustion and a drop in motivation. Moreover, children require time to relax, have fun, and partake in extracurricular activities to maintain a healthy balance in their lives. Overloading them with extra classes can rob them of this necessary downtime, ultimately impacting both their mental and physical health.In summary, while extra classes can be advantageous for certain children, it is vital for parents to evaluate their child's specific needs and make thoughtful choices. By doing this, parents can ensure their children receive a comprehensive education that meets their individual requirements without compromising their overall well-being. Ultimately, finding a balance between academic pursuits and leisure time is essential for nurturing happy, healthy, and well-adjusted individuals.
305;Write about the following topic.Many people use written language in a less formal and more relaxed way. Why? Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, written language is used in comparatively more informal and relaxed way. I assume that it happens because of the need of making communication easier and faster. Without features of formal written language it is simplier to share your idea in a shorter period of time. This option is essential in a modern temp of life. This essay will cover both advantages and disadvantages of this development.The less formal and tense written language provides some pros. First of all, without formalization the process of communication requires less amount of time. Then letters consists of less number of symbols and can help to solve the discussed problem much faster. Moreover, this way of communication does not support formal borders between members of a dialogue. Then it is easier to come closer with the interlocutor and feel no pressure during the using of written language.On the other hand, development of making written language more informal and relaxed has some cons. Firstly, communication goes less respectful. Then interlocutors have almost no opportunity to pay a respect to each other. Formalized written language is significant in issue of social borders that can hihlight a paid respect. Secondly, sometimes the main gist of the letter goes unclear, because informal language is more relaxed. In these conditions, the quidity of the letter can be hidden with less formal features. If participants of the communication are not close, they will not understand each other correctly.In conclusion I would like to say that the process of using written language in a more informal way has both advantages and disadvantages. It can be revealed in different situations. That is why everyone should have their own opinion based on the information discussed in this essay.;In recent years, there has been a notable transformation in how people engage with written language. Many now adopt a more casual and laid-back tone in their writing, especially when it comes to digital communication. This shift is largely driven by the growth of social media, text messaging, and email, which have turned writing into a more informal and spontaneous practice.One factor contributing to this change is the increasing casualness of contemporary life. With the rise of digital platforms, individuals often write in a more conversational style, similar to how they would communicate in person. For example, social media sites like Twitter and Facebook promote short, friendly posts that frequently omit the formalities found in traditional writing. Additionally, the need for speed and conciseness in digital interactions has encouraged a relaxed approach, with writers using abbreviations, acronyms, and emojis to quickly convey their messages.This trend comes with both benefits and drawbacks. On the positive side, a casual writing style can enable quicker and more effortless communication, allowing for freer and more spontaneous self-expression. It also makes written language more inviting and relatable, particularly for younger audiences who are used to digital formats. Conversely, a decline in formal writing skills may lead to reduced clarity and precision in communication, potentially resulting in misunderstandings. Moreover, the casual tone of modern writing can detract from the significance of proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation, all of which are vital for effective communication.In summary, the movement toward a more relaxed and informal style of writing reflects the realities of the digital era. While it provides benefits in terms of speed and accessibility, it also poses challenges to clarity and precision in communication. As we navigate this evolving landscape of written language, it is crucial to find a balance between informality and formality, ensuring our writing remains effective, engaging, and respectful.
1161;Write about the following topic.More and more people are relying on the private car as their major means of transportation.Describe some of the problems over-reliance on cars can cause, and suggest at least one possible solution.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;That of trasportation is a question that have troubled all the people over the world, whatever it is the city or town in which they live. In the last years people used to relying on the private car to move around. . Although the possible reasons that persuaded people to use private cars, the problems that rise from their excessive use, such us traffic and pollution, are harsh consequences to be accepted. I think that an improvement of public trasportation and to incentive the use of ecological means of trasport like bicycle should be possible solution to those issues.Cars are considered the most confortable mean of trasport. In particular, if you have to move in a big cities like Milan. Indeed, means of trasports sometimes are late or full and also more unsafe. If you are a woman, for example, the use of public trasportation in some part of Italy is not safe mostly during the night hours. Another problem is that of comfort. If people use their car they can go whethever they want, when they want. If they have to spend more time in a place, they have not to be worried about the last bus they had to take to come back home.However, over-reliance of cars cause at least two big problmes: traffic and pollution. On the one hand, the problem of traffic will produce other issues such as anxiety and irritation. Indeed, if you have to go work in the morning and you live in a city like Rome you have to consider at least one hour spent in the traffic. Pollution is surely the most severe issue. Indeed, if all the people used to take a private car, then it is easely imaginable how much cars and fuel can be consumed daily. The two problems are linked, I want to underline, indeed, the noise pollution that derives from an intense traffic. It should be considered dangerous both for persons and animals.Two possible solutions to the problem of the over-reliance on cars are the following. Firstly, public trasportation should be improved. Indeed, if bus and tram were more safe and more confortable, then people would be more tent by their use. At least, they will solve the problem of traffic. On the other hand, I see the echologycal means of transport like bycicle as the new border to pass in order to save the world from pollution. One possible suggestion would be that of make cheaper the bycicle and also to give an economic subsidy to those people who decide to help the planet using them.In conclusion, I believe that the the use of private cars, because of the problems that it causes, should be discouraged. Two possible solutions rely on the improvement of public trasportation and on the incentive can be given to those using non-polluting means of trasport;The growing dependence on private vehicles as the dominant mode of transport has become a widespread phenomenon in various regions globally. This excessive reliance on cars can lead to numerous challenges, influencing both the environment and the quality of urban living. One of the most pressing concerns is the rise in traffic congestion, which results in lost time, elevated air pollution, and increased stress for commuters. Additionally, vehicle emissions contribute to climate change and worsen air quality, posing significant health risks to the community.Another consequence of car-centric culture is urban sprawl, where cities extend outward, creating less densely populated zones. This expansion can lead to the destruction of natural habitats and farmland, along with a heightened demand for extensive and expensive infrastructure projects, such as road widening and parking facilities.To address these challenges, one effective solution is to develop and enhance public transportation systems. A well-designed, reliable, and cost-effective public transit system can drastically lower the number of private vehicles on the road, thus alleviating traffic congestion and reducing emissions. For example, cities like Tokyo and New York boast comprehensive public transportation networks, including subways, buses, and trains, which encourage shared transportation over individual car use. Moreover, creating pedestrian and bike-friendly infrastructure can further support alternative, healthier, and more eco-friendly transportation options.In summary, the heavy reliance on private cars is a critical issue that demands urgent attention. By investing in strong public transit systems and promoting sustainable transportation alternatives, we can work towards building more livable, environmentally friendly cities for future generations. It is essential for governments, urban planners, and individuals to collaborate in identifying and implementing effective solutions to this challenge, ensuring a healthier and more sustainable transportation future.
1051;"Write about the following topic.Most people have forgotten the meaning behind traditional or religious festivals; during festival periods, people nowadays only want to enjoy themselves.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.";"In recent years, it is argued that many people have lost track of the meaning behind traditional and religious celebrations; Now, people seem to treat these celebrations as another holiday break. The following essay will fully endorse the statement and examine the reasons behind it.Firstly, there are several reasons why people forgot about the message behind celebrations. One of the most significant one is globalisation. As people start connecting with each other through social media worldwide, many people are too distracted with the latest trends and updates. A study from Yales University mentioned that 60% of the population on earth do not persuit the stories about their traditional roots and background. Hence, they do not celebrate festive or cultural events meaningfully. Another important reason is broken families. People who experienced a tough childhood without a male or female parent are not capable of understanding their own traditions and values. Therefore, they do not grasp the concept of cultural celebrations.Moreover, there are also cons to this arguments as people just want to take a holiday break. Although people may argue that it is important to remember the intention behind diverse celebrations, others just want to use the day for self-fulfillment purposes. For example, people would organise a party and invite friends over to their house so they can have a good time. Another argument that people only want enjoyment during festive periods is work-stress related illnesses. The majority of middle class workers are hardworking and dedicated to their job. However, the period of time for holiday breaks are significantly short and they just want to use the celebration events to rest at home. Despite the fact that they are neglecting their duties to demonstrate the meaning behind these celebrations to the younger generations, they also have a right to take care of themselves mentally and physically before others.In conclusion, there are both sides of the argument on why people think others have forgotten the meaning behind event celebrations and why this is not neccesarily true all the time. Personally, I agree that people should always find the meaning behind these celebrations in order to understand themselves better.";The idea that most people have lost sight of the meanings behind traditional or religious festivals, focusing solely on enjoyment, is a topic that invites discussion. While it’s true that many individuals today often concentrate on the festive aspects of these occasions, I only partially concur with this view.On one hand, the commercialization and secularization of festivals have altered how people perceive these events. Holidays like Christmas and Halloween have become heavily marketed, with a greater emphasis on gift-giving, costumes, and parties than on their original religious or cultural significance. Consequently, it’s common to find people celebrating these occasions without a profound understanding or appreciation of their historical and symbolic roots.On the other hand, numerous individuals and communities continue to honor the traditional and religious dimensions of these festivals. For instance, during the Lunar New Year, many Asian cultures emphasize family reunions, sacred rituals, and reflections on the past year, alongside the festivities and fireworks. Likewise, religious celebrations such as Easter and Diwali remain deeply entrenched in their spiritual contexts for millions around the globe.From my own observations, while some people might prioritize the entertainment value of these festivals, there are also many who actively seek to comprehend and respect the deeper meanings and traditions associated with them. This coexistence of enjoyment and reverence is indeed practiced by many.In conclusion, while it is correct to assert that some individuals have overlooked the original meanings of traditional and religious festivals, this is not a universal reality. Many still cherish these celebrations for their cultural and spiritual significance, alongside the joy they bring.
939;Write about the following topic.Music is played in every society and culture in the world today.Some people think that music brings only benefits to individuals and societies. Others, however, think that music can have a negative influence on both.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Music is the moonlight in the gloomy night of life.It is the universal language of mankind.There are mixed opinions about music on whether it is advantageous or not to individuals and society.This essay will discuss about pros and cons of music being part of our life.Some people have a perception that playing or listening to music is not beneficial in any manner. They feel music separates a person from socializing and that it is a form of addiction and distraction.Especially, parents feel that their child's concentration is impacted while multitasking with music and studies.For extroverts its a sort of discomfort or hindrance.Few extroverts feel better to share their feelings and difficulties with others than staying alone and listening to a song. Few recorded instances has suggested that sad music inculcates negative thoughts and aggression while in depression.On the other hand, there are people who think that music having a negative effect on individual and society is completely preposterous.They feel that tunes produces a kind of pleasure which human nature cannot do without.Music is a form of expression of feelings rather than being a hindrance.It greatly helps people to overcome their hurdles.Soothing and melodious music gives a refreshing effect.Jazz and Pop music facilitates society to come together and dance.Concerrts helps certain groups to spend time for relaxation from their busy schedule.Not only that, singing or playing instruments is a form of expression of their feelings.The essay argued that though music is considered to be a distraction , it is a form of rejuvenation to both society and individuals of all age groups.;The universal language of music is a vital component of every society and culture, bridging geographical and linguistic divides. While some individuals assert that music solely yields positive outcomes for both individuals and communities, others contend that it can exert negative effects. In this essay, I will explore both perspectives and share my viewpoint on the issue.On one side, music is often praised for its myriad benefits. It possesses the ability to evoke deep emotions, foster a sense of belonging, and serve as a medium for personal expression. For instance, music has historically been a catalyst for social change, with numerous artists leveraging their art to highlight social issues and encourage unity. Additionally, studies have indicated that listening to music can enhance mental well-being by alleviating stress and anxiety. Music also plays a crucial role in safeguarding cultural heritage, as traditional melodies and dances are integral to many cultural festivals and celebrations.Conversely, some individuals argue that music can have detrimental effects. Certain music genres, such as heavy metal or gangsta rap, may be seen as promoting violence, aggression, and misogyny. Furthermore, music can serve as a vehicle for propaganda, disseminating hateful ideologies and divisive themes. Excessive volume from music can also contribute to disturbances, impacting daily life and leading to noise pollution.In my view, music is a double-edged sword, with the potential to offer both benefits and drawbacks. While it can inspire and unify people, it can equally be exploited to manipulate and divide. Ultimately, the effects of music hinge on the context in which it is created and the intentions behind it. As conscious individuals, we must be discerning about the music we choose to engage with and promote, ensuring that it fosters a positive influence on ourselves and our communities. By doing so, we can leverage the power of music to cultivate a more harmonious and inclusive world.
587;Write about the following topic.Nowadays, sports is a big business with high earnings for professional sports people and companies involved both financially and other ways. Is this a positive or negative development for sports?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is argued that using mobile devices is as antisocial as smoking and that in certain areas smoking has been forbidden so mobile devices should be prohibited as well. I strongly disagree with this statement because this would not solve the initial problem and could turn out expensive as well.Firstly, banning mobile devices from certain places would be exagerated. This is because smoking actually damages your body, while the use of mobile phones is comparatively harmless. For example, a recent research found out that the risk of lung cancer grows by 0,02% with every cigarette, while high screen time has less damaging side effects like the loss of concentration. Altough the use of mobile phones is sometimes antisocial, I think that we should concentrate on the origins of this problem than simply prohibit it in certain areas.Secondly, banning mobile devices would have a regulatory side effect which could be expensive. The government would have to decide on new laws as well as implement them. Furthermore, it would be no easy task for the police to control these rules in an efficient way. As a result, police would struggle with a high workload. Admittely, I have enough faith in our legal system and I am sure that they could manage it but I think that we have more prescious und urgent tasks to concentrate on.In conclusion, I strongly disagree with banning mobile devices in certain areas. However, I admit that we use our phones too much which sometimes leads to antisocial behaviour. Nevertheless, prohibiting the phones in certain areas would not solve this problem and could as well be expensive for the government.;In recent years, the commercialization of sports has emerged as a significant trend, leading to substantial financial gains for both professional athletes and companies. I believe this shift carries both positive and negative consequences for the sports world.On the positive side, the influx of capital into sports has enhanced the quality of competitions. Elite athletes can now dedicate themselves to training and performance without the burden of financial stress. For example, renowned footballers like Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi generate millions through endorsements and salaries, allowing them to sustain their remarkable skill levels. Moreover, increased investment in sports infrastructure has resulted in the development of cutting-edge stadiums and facilities, which improve both the fan experience and athletic performance.Conversely, the commercialization of sports presents certain drawbacks. The emphasis on financial gain has often overshadowed traditional sporting values, leading to an unhealthy focus on winning at any cost instead of promoting fair play and sportsmanship. This trend is evident in the various doping scandals in sports like athletics and cycling, where athletes have jeopardized their health and reputations in pursuit of a competitive advantage. Additionally, the substantial earnings of professional athletes can create unrealistic expectations and pressures for young competitors, potentially harming their mental and physical well-being.In summary, while the commercialization of sports offers numerous advantages, including enhanced athlete performance and improved facilities, it also poses serious threats to the integrity and values of sports. To strike a balance between financial interests and the principles of sportsmanship, governing bodies and organizations must prioritize fair play and athlete welfare, ensuring that the true essence of sports remains intact amid the burgeoning commercial landscape.
1133;Write about the following topic.People in all modern societies use drugs, but today's youth are experimenting with both legal and illegal drugs, and at an increasingly early age. Some sociologists claim that parents and other members of society often set a bad example.Discuss the causes and some effects of widespread drug use by young people in modern day society. Make any recommendations you feel are necessary to help fight youth drug abuse.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The use of drugs has been a warning habit in modern day society. In some research, it shows that households are losing their financing easily due to the fact that one of the parents has been addicted to drugs. Although there are some drugs which were approved by the government to be used moderately, yet some people are using these drugs heavily.This has drawn the attention of the youth either by a drug addict parent or a friend. Moreover, the number of youngsters taking drugs has increased dramatically throughout the years as there are people who provide these drugs in the black market. This critical issue has caused serious issues both socially and mentally.The social and mental impact of using drugs by the youngsters have damaged the educational progress, the social participation such as family and friends gatherings. Additionally, lack of stamina, weight loss, and loss of appetite are key factors of excessive use of drugs.There is a number of contributing elements to the phenomena. One of these elements is the sense of belonging to a group. Since humans are social animals, young people want to have the feeling of being accepted and loved, and this can be sensible when it comes to a group of friends. Therefore, once someone introduces a drug, the rest of the group will try, and if one says no, then they will be rejected. However, this rejection can be helping to solve this alarming issue.The solution is to find a way to distinguish the types of drugs and legalize the ones that do not harm greatly and prepare in parallel the better ways to control the consumption of drugs.;The rampant use of drugs among youth in contemporary society is a critical issue that needs urgent attention. Sociologists emphasize that parents and other societal figures frequently model poor behavior, which can prompt early experimentation with both legal and illegal substances. A major contributor to this phenomenon is the normalization of drug use in daily life. Many adolescents encounter drug use through social media, peer pressure, and sometimes even their own families, fostering a belief that drug consumption is both acceptable and harmless.Additionally, a key element in this crisis is the insufficient education and awareness regarding the risks associated with drug use. Many schools and families do not equip young people with the necessary information and guidance, leaving them susceptible to the temptation of drugs. The pressures and stresses of modern life, such as academic and social demands, may also drive young individuals to seek relief through substance use.The repercussions of widespread drug use among the youth are dire. It can result in addiction, various health issues, and even fatalities. Furthermore, it adversely affects their mental and emotional health, relationships, and future opportunities. Research indicates that drug use can significantly lower academic performance and increase the likelihood of school dropout among teenagers.To tackle youth drug abuse, it is crucial to implement educational and awareness initiatives that clearly communicate the risks and repercussions of drug use. Parents, educators, and community leaders need to model positive behavior and foster open discussions with young people. In addition, governments and organizations should invest in evidence-based prevention and treatment programs that target the underlying causes of drug use, while offering support to those battling addiction. By collaborating, we can empower young individuals to make informed decisions and mitigate the severe consequences of drug abuse.
981;Write about the following topic.Psychologists have known for many years that colour can affect how people feel. For this reason, attention should be given to colour schemes when decorating places such as offices and hospitals.How true is this statement?How far does colour influence people’s health and capacity for work?;The colours and its affect on humans feelings always interested the psychologists and become a part of their researches. This researches get the attention of the organizations and help them to shape their designs of their offices or buildings. In this essay, I will talk about the affects of colour and its influence on some parts of human's life.It is true that certain colours are affecting our mental state and feelings at some level. Because of our visual plays an important role in our pyschology, colours are becoming important issue that needs to be point out. For example, the alertness effect of red colour on human's feeling is well known by the goverments. In order to alert people, stop signs or traffic lights are always include some level of red colour. This way, humans can be warned and accidents numbers can be decreased.Also, this affect of colours can play a big role in our health and work place. To give an example, the infinity effect of white colour is always used by hospitals. They paint their desks, tables, rooms, bathrooms or walls to white colour most of the time. This way, they calm their patients and help them to relieve their stress. Another example is grey. It is one of the favourite colour of the companies. They use this colour mainly in their office to make sure their employees are not distracted so they can finish their task.To conclude, colours are very affective in our mood and feelings. They are being used by the organizations to benefit from this effect.;"For decades, psychologists have explored how colour affects human emotions and behaviour. It is indeed vital to consider colour schemes when designing environments such as offices and hospitals. Research indicates that colours significantly influence mood, health, and productivity.In office settings, colour choices can energize or soothe employees, depending on the desired atmosphere. For example, shades of blue and green are associated with tranquility and calmness, making them ideal for high-stress work environments. In contrast, warm colours like orange and yellow can enhance energy and creativity, which are beneficial for spaces that prioritize innovation and problem-solving.In hospitals, the intentional use of colour can greatly affect patient recovery and the well-being of staff. Soft colours such as light blue and pale green foster a calming environment, helping to alleviate anxiety and stress in patients. Conversely, colours like red and purple can invigorate the brain, enhancing focus and alertness among healthcare professionals.The impact of colour on health and work performance is significant. Research has shown that certain colours can lower blood pressure, reduce heart rates, and diminish stress levels while enhancing mood and cognitive abilities. Moreover, thoughtfully chosen colour schemes can influence employee absenteeism, job satisfaction, and productivity.In summary, prioritizing colour schemes when designing offices and hospitals is not merely a matter of aesthetics; it is essential for the well-being and effectiveness of the individuals within these spaces. By leveraging the power of colours, we can create environments that foster emotional stability, promote physical health, and enhance mental clarity, ultimately leading to better health outcomes and improved work efficiency. Thus, it is clear that colour schemes should be a key focus in the design of these environments."
1173;Write about the following topic.Rich countries should allow jobs for skilled and knowledgeable employees who are from poor countries. Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"In development countries they must allow works for people who have skills and experience employees from poor countries. I agree with this point of view because everyone they should have a chance. There were a opportunities and benefits.The first point, I would like to make is that there were a great opportunities for both rich countries and people who came from poor areas. When people thinking to transfer abroad there were many reason but the most important when they want a chance to show of there craft and ability. Such as, Indian people they travelled many areas and they give them a lot of discoveries and skills; moreover, the rich countries need some people to help to make their country better place for living. For example, I have read an article in the newspaper they talked about development countries like UK, US and Arabic countries they need those people to improve their economy and life.The second point, I will clarify is that there were many benefits when this countries allow jobs for those. They will be equality for all ;furthermore, there will be a improvement in living. For instance, I have saw a T.V decomontry they say "" In United States there are a equality and improvement in live between people they came from Africaand citizens they help them to have good education, skills and experience also they contribute the US economy to growth "".Finally, we can say that there were a opportunities and benefits for both sides. I am with this to have good life for all. I hope in the future poor countries they can take benefits from those people and developed their country to came better than now .";"The debate over whether affluent countries should allow skilled and knowledgeable workers from less wealthy nations to enter their labor markets is a challenging one. Personally, I am in strong support of this idea. Enabling skilled individuals from poorer countries to find employment in wealthier nations offers numerous advantages for both sides.For starters, rich countries stand to benefit significantly from the arrival of skilled workers, who bring new ideas, diverse viewpoints, and specialized expertise that may be lacking domestically. For example, highly trained doctors and nurses from developing nations can help address shortages in healthcare, enhancing the overall quality of medical services available. Additionally, these workers contribute to the economic growth of their host countries through taxes and increased consumer spending.Conversely, skilled workers from less affluent nations gain substantial advantages by working in wealthier countries. They enjoy higher salaries and improved working conditions, as well as the opportunity to acquire valuable experience and skills that they can later take back home. This process, often referred to as ""brain gain,"" can aid in the development of the economies of their native countries and help alleviate poverty over time. For instance, Indian software engineers who work in the United States may eventually return to India to launch their own tech startups, thereby stimulating economic progress and creating jobs.In summary, allowing skilled and knowledgeable professionals from poorer nations to work in wealthier countries creates a mutually beneficial scenario. It promotes cultural diversity, fosters economic growth, and facilitates the transfer of skills. Therefore, affluent nations should embrace the opportunity to welcome skilled workers from less prosperous countries, as this can yield positive outcomes for both the host country and the workers’ countries of origin."
973;Write about the following topic.Some organisations believe that their employees should dress smartly. Others value quality of work above appearance.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Manners in the workplace have always been a topic that is discussed by many people as it is essential to know how we should behave in such a formal environment. Some companies give the opinion that their workers should have a smart look while others consider the attitude toward the job more important.To my mind, appearance should not the only thing to be considered. We can dress smartly and impress others, but it is only the first impression. Therefore, productivity, quality of work, and the way we are responsible for our tasks are things that make us outstanding workers. Moreover, it is obvious that the success of one company does not depend on how its employees dress but on how it is organized.In spite of the fact that dressing does not play a key role in the value of a worker, a neat and intelligent appearance still gives us significant benefits. I always suggest that one should dress suitably in different situations. In fact, it is not crucial for an organization to ask their employees to dress formally, but a set of smart casual clothes is something that we should wear when it comes to the working environment. It is because that wearing politely shows how we respect our jobs, our employers, and even our workmates. In some cases, a company's professionalism can be seen through the way its workers wear.To sum up, dressing smartly is not the best and only thing that one worker can do to have better performance. However, having a good appearance is something that great employees would do since it can be considered as their respect for the jobs.;The discussion surrounding whether employees should prioritize dressing smartly or focus on the quality of their work has generated significant debate among organizations. On one side, some companies argue that a professional appearance is crucial as it reflects the company’s image and professionalism. For instance, banks and law firms may enforce formal attire for their employees to convey trust and reliability to clients. Such a dress code can also enhance employees' confidence and motivation, making them feel more prepared for their tasks.Conversely, other organizations emphasize the importance of work quality over appearance, asserting that results matter more than how one dresses. This mindset is often found in tech companies and startups where innovation and creativity take precedence. Employees are encouraged to dress casually, fostering a relaxed and collaborative atmosphere, which may lead to increased productivity and greater job satisfaction.In my view, the quality of work should take priority over appearance. Although dressing smartly can create a positive impression, it is ultimately an employee's skills, commitment, and work ethic that determine their success. Additionally, overly strict dress codes can hinder creativity and individuality—elements that are vital for innovation and progress. For instance, companies like Google and Facebook have embraced casual dress codes, which have not impeded their success but have, in fact, contributed to their vibrant and innovative workplace culture. In summary, while there are advantages to dressing smartly, I believe organizations should prioritize quality of work, enabling employees to concentrate on their responsibilities and express their individuality rather than conforming to rigid dress standards.
495;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that it is good to share as much information as possible in scientific research, business and the academic world. Others believe that some information is too important or too valuable to be shared freely.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In recent years, some people believe that it is good to share information about scientific research, business and the academic field to many people. Others reckon that such informations are too important or too valuable to be share for free. Here are discussions of the statements and my opinion.By development of the technology, people can more likely to access to valuable information such as experimental results and interviewing results of citizens than before. Some people use it for their academic interests or for the business strategies, so that people believe that such information contribute to companies profits or individuals' advantages in academic. For example, many of the medical students read dissertation of diseases, which were written in the past. By reading and using the scientific information students will become excellent professionals.On the other hand, people can access informations from any countries via internet. Recently, increasing the cyber crimes is the serious problem all over the world. Therefore some people reckon that it is too risky to share valuable informations. If information on valuable national research results is leaked, the country would had enormous loss for the economy.To sum up ,sharing as much informations as possible is useful for the everyone to improve their academic skills and contribute to their companies, while easier access to every aspects of informations might bring disadvantages such as information leakage or cybercrime. In my opinion, I mostly agree with it is good to share information, but I believe the source of information needs to be careful not to misuse the sources.;The ongoing debate about information sharing in scientific research, business, and academia has ignited considerable discussion. Proponents argue that widespread sharing of information promotes collaboration, fuels innovation, and accelerates advancements. This philosophy has led to significant breakthroughs in diverse fields like medicine and technology, where open-source research and data exchange have empowered scientists to build on each other's discoveries and achieve impressive results.Conversely, some contend that certain types of information are too valuable or sensitive to be shared openly. In the business sector, for example, proprietary data such as trade secrets and intellectual property can represent a company’s most critical assets. Disclosing such information might result in unfair competition, financial harm, and potential bankruptcy. Similarly, in academic settings, researchers may be reluctant to share their findings too early for fear of others claiming credit for their work or misusing their ideas.From my perspective, a balanced approach is crucial. While the benefits of information sharing are evident, it's also vital to safeguard sensitive and valuable data. A selective sharing strategy, where information is exchanged among trusted individuals or via secure channels, can reduce the risks associated with unrestricted dissemination. For instance, in scientific research, data can be shared anonymously or published in peer-reviewed journals to ensure that contributors receive appropriate recognition. Ultimately, achieving success in information sharing hinges on finding a balance between collaboration and protection, enabling progress while safeguarding valuable and sensitive information. By embracing this approach, we can reap the advantages of information sharing while mitigating its potential pitfalls.
273;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Environmental problems are the biggest issue that people have to concern and by product form fossil fuels is one of causes. Someone think one way that can reduce result from fuels is sale car fuels in higher price. In my opinion, I disagree with this because highly price of oil leads to other problems such as financial problem and impact to food price, moreover, we can heal their environment by other ways.The negative effects of increasing the cost of vehciles fuels are improtant to human life. The significant points is price of basic requirements, for instance, foods and medicines which have to transportation by trucks that use oil fuels for movement. The expensive fuels increase business costs, so their products price are rising up. Futhermore, social problems follow by financial problems. When poor people do not have money but they still hunger, they will steal some food or water this situation roads to social problems.Other ways to reduce environment problems, the causes of this problem are not only fossil fuel but also agricultural or industial aspect which we have to focus on. Intustial areas are the top areas that make lot of pollutions such as air pollution, water pollution from thier procesing and chemical pollution which they use during process. Those of them lead to many problems and effect to qulity of human life. Moveover agricultural areas, there produce many of gas which result to global warming.In conclusion, the increasing car fuels might reduce some of environmental problems but also have drawback to population life. We should to chooce other ways to protect enviromant without effect to our life.;The idea that raising fuel prices for cars and other vehicles can effectively address environmental issues has gained considerable traction in recent years. Personally, I have a mixed viewpoint on this matter, as I believe that higher fuel costs can yield both positive and negative environmental outcomes.On one hand, elevating fuel prices may reduce the number of vehicles on the roads, which can subsequently lower air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. For example, countries like Norway and Sweden have experienced a significant increase in the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles due to high fuel taxes, which has resulted in a meaningful reduction in emissions. Furthermore, increased fuel prices can motivate individuals to utilize public transportation, walk, or cycle, thereby diminishing the ecological footprint of transportation.Conversely, raising fuel costs can negatively impact low-income families and businesses that heavily depend on transportation. In developing nations, where public transport options are scarce, higher fuel prices can trigger increased living expenses, adversely affecting many livelihoods. Additionally, such an increase might drive a shift toward alternative fuels, such as coal or wood, that are not necessarily eco-friendly, potentially worsening environmental issues.In summary, while raising fuel prices can be an effective strategy for mitigating environmental problems, it is not a simple solution. Governments should explore a variety of approaches, including investing in public transport systems, promoting alternative energy sources, and implementing targeted taxes and subsidies to encourage environmentally responsible behaviors. Ultimately, a comprehensive strategy that considers the social, economic, and environmental dimensions is essential for effectively tackling environmental challenges.
135;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that school children should not be given homework by their teachers, whereas others argue that homework plays an important role in the education of children.Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The issue that whether teachers should assign homework or not has attracted great attention recently.Some people believe that homework is a good way to consolidate students'learning effect.However,others argue that homework exerts huge pressure on students,which is bad for their long-term development.As for me,appropriate homework should be seen as the better choice.I will explain my idea from two aspects.Firstly,homework could examine student's learning results.After teaching the basic content,giving some homework is important to consolidate the knowledge.As an old saying goes,practice makes things perfect.Only doing many practices,can we master the knowledge proficiently.There is an example.In my teaching experiences,I found the students finishing their homework better would achieve higher scores in final examination,while those who couldn't finish their ordinary homework would gain lower grades in any examination.And my translation skills were also improved by practicing the homework from my guiders who gave the targeted examination to me.Secondly,too much homework will cause so many negative effects,such as making students tired very much,causing their depressed mood and their bored emotion.For example,my brother's daughter always suffered from the huge homework which was assigned by his Chinese teacher.She once complained with me that everyday she felt tired and bored after finishing Chinese teacher's assignments.So appropriate homework is reasonable for most students and those ideas that the more homework,the better students' scores ,are wrong to certain extent.Sometimes huge homework is the reason that why some students'scores are reduced.In sum,removing homework is not an ideal option for student's improvement in learning,and reasonable homework provides us a better way to deal with the problem.That is to say,we should strike a balance between assigning homework and removing homework.;The controversy surrounding the assignment of homework to schoolchildren has ignited passionate discussions among educators and parents alike. On one side, some argue that homework is unnecessary and may negatively impact a child's physical and mental health. They contend that children already dedicate substantial time to their studies and should have the opportunity to unwind and participate in extracurricular activities after school. This, they argue, could alleviate stress and mitigate the risk of burnout.Conversely, many believe that homework is an integral component of a child's education. They assert that it reinforces learning, cultivates critical thinking skills, and fosters self-discipline and responsibility. Additionally, homework enables teachers to gauge a child's comprehension of specific concepts and offer further assistance when necessary. For example, in my personal experience, completing homework has deepened my understanding of challenging mathematical concepts and enhanced my problem-solving abilities.In my view, homework is vital to a child's educational growth. While excessive homework can be detrimental, a reasonable amount can effectively reinforce learning and prepare children for future academic challenges. Furthermore, it equips children with essential life skills like time management, organization, and self-motivation. Nonetheless, educators should strive to ensure that homework is purposeful, pertinent, and manageable rather than merely a tedious task. By achieving a balance between classroom work and homework, children can foster a love for learning, reach academic success, and flourish in their future pursuits. Ultimately, homework is a valuable asset that can enrich a child's educational journey, and I strongly believe it should remain an integral part of their learning experience.
525;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child's development while others think that it is important for children to go to school.Discuss the advantages of both methods and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In regards to the notion 'it is important for children to go to school', there are two contrasting opinions of supporting it and also disagreeing with it. Schools are conceptually thought to be essential and compulsory for many parents while others may not despite of what the society says.There are people who suggest that going to school is indeed necessary for children and students as it enables them to develop social ability and make friends which will ultimately be useful in the future. Attending school, a microsom of society, itself already teaches young students how to interact with other people ouside of family tree. Those who did not attend school when they were young may have severly low EQ or lacking interaction ability. For instance, an adult who was studying at home might not know how to respect and share objects with others. By being enrolled in a school, children can make remarkable childhood memories that may help them in the future when they are in a slump or depression.On the other hand, some people may disagree to this notion as they think studying at home is far more effective. Their argument might be that going to school would be a waste of time as children usually play around at school. Teaching children can be much more efficient as transportation time and playing time can be eliminatied by not going to school. Furthermore, as children do not have to go out, there will not be any conflicts on bullying or fight with friends. They will not fall onto deviation such as smoking, drinking et cetera which are usually encountered at school due to bad friends. Also, money can be saved by teaching at home as uniforms, for example, do not have to purchased.All in all, although young students might have number of advantages by not going to school, it is nevertheless more important to attend school in a daily basis to improve their social ability and interaction with other people.;The ongoing discussion about the optimal method for a child's development has led to significant debate among parents and educators. Some advocate for homeschooling as the most effective strategy, while others contend that attending school is crucial for a child's growth. In this essay, I will examine the benefits of both approaches and share my perspective.On one side, education at home offers a customized and adaptable learning experience. Parents can adjust their teaching to suit their child's specific needs, interests, and learning styles, which can enhance the overall educational process. Additionally, homeschooling creates a safe and nurturing environment, free from bullying and peer pressure that can negatively impact a child's emotional health. For example, a friend of mine was homeschooled due to health issues and thrived both academically and socially without the strains associated with traditional schooling.Conversely, attending school brings numerous advantages, including opportunities for social interaction, exposure to diverse perspectives, and access to various resources and facilities. Schools allow children to engage with peers from different backgrounds, promoting empathy, tolerance, and essential life skills. Moreover, the variety of extracurricular activities, sports, and clubs available in schools can help children explore new interests and develop their talents. I have personally witnessed how my younger siblings have formed meaningful friendships and developed a sense of belonging through their school experiences.In my view, attending school is the most advantageous approach for a child's development. While homeschooling can offer personalized instruction, it often does not provide the socialization and diversity that a school environment fosters. Schools deliver a comprehensive education that equips children for the complexities of an interconnected world. However, I recognize that homeschooling can be an effective option for certain children, particularly those with special needs or unique circumstances that call for a more individualized approach. Ultimately, the choice between homeschooling and attending school should be based on the specific needs and situations of each child.
323;Write about the following topic.Some people believe women are better leaders than men. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is argued by some individuals that men aren't skilled enough as women in regard to leadership. This essay disagrees with the given statement as leadership skills are not depending on gender but are strongly related to people's personality and work experience.The role of a leader should not be stereotyped according to gender, for example, women might be considered more powerful than men because they could normally appear more organised and perfectionist. Indeed, several studies concerning leadership and the role of the leader, have demonstrated that some people have innate attitudes of a leader regardless of their gender. Some of those attitudes are related to active listening, emotional intelligence skills and great communication abilities. Thus, if effectively developed and fostered, those skills can support individuals to achieve higher roles in leadership and management.In the same way, the working experience also plays a crucial role in determining and further developing leadership skills. For example, a large number of women are still renouncing to their career paths in order to care for their families. Indeed, most of the women, apply for part-time roles which do not offer the opportunity to achieve a leadership role despite their abilities. For this reason, is difficult to affirm if women are better than men in leadership.To conclude, the role of a leader is shaped by innate characteristics and people's personalities regardless of their gender. Moreover, the poor presence of women employed in leadership roles does not create pieces of evidence to support such a point of view.;"The idea that women may be superior leaders to men has ignited a lively debate in recent years. While some individuals support this perspective, others contend that effective leadership is not a function of gender. Personally, I hold a balanced view; I acknowledge that women have exhibited remarkable leadership qualities in many cases, yet I also maintain that leadership is not confined to one gender.On one side of the argument, women often possess a distinctive array of attributes, such as empathy, strong communication, and multitasking skills, all of which are vital for successful leadership. For instance, Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany, has garnered acclaim for her steady and composed approach to managing crises, displaying exceptional leadership throughout the European financial turmoil. Similarly, Jacinda Ardern, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, has exhibited outstanding leadership in her response to the COVID-19 pandemic, approaching governance with both compassion and decisiveness.Conversely, there are countless examples of impactful male leaders who have made invaluable contributions in their fields. For example, Nelson Mandela was a transformative leader who instrumental in dismantling apartheid in South Africa, showcasing immense courage and leadership. Furthermore, leadership is shaped more by an individual’s abilities, experiences, and character rather than their gender.In summary, while I agree that women can be outstanding leaders, I do not believe they are inherently superior to men. Leadership is a multifaceted quality that cannot be simply defined by gender. Ultimately, what truly matters is a leader's capacity to inspire, motivate, and make well-informed choices, irrespective of their gender. By embracing and appreciating the diverse leadership styles and strengths present in all individuals, we can strive towards a more inclusive and impactful leadership landscape."
247;Write about the following topic.Some people feel that manufacturers and supermarkets have the responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging of goods. Others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Packing of goods has become a noticeable issue nowadays, especially in terms of environmental concerns and sustainable development of society. In order to reduce the amount of packaging, some people believe that manufacturers and supermarkets are more responsible for taking measures, while others insist that customers play a more critical role in reality. In my view, the effort needs to be made by the supplier and the consumer both to guarantee the achievement of the goal.On the one hand, the problem of over-packaging is often caused by commercial strategy. The supplier attempts to use beautiful packaging to make their products more attractive to customers. It is fairly easy to imagine that people would be more likely to choose a product decorated gorgeously than the same one with a plain appearance provided that there is thus no significant increase in price. Following that, producers would try to make every effort to obtain more competitive packaging for their products, which probably leads to excessive use of the wrap. Therefore, it is undoubtedly the duty of the producer to partake in reducing the amount of over-packaging by finding another way to improve the competitiveness of their products instead of merely attaching more value to their appearance.On the other hand, the behaviors of customers give rise to over-packaging as well. The more attention that people will pay to the appearance of goods, the more encouraged producers will be to exert themselves on wrapping. Moreover, the public awareness about the harmful influence of over-packaging is also profound in decreasing the amount of packaging. As customers take the problems caused by over-packaging into account, they would be more willing to purchase the goods with less packaging, which is a highly practical way to prevent producers from wrapping unduly.In conclusion, it is clear that suppliers and customers both are responsible for the trend of over-packaging. Therefore, the success of altering the situation needs the participation of them both.;The ongoing discussion about who should be responsible for mitigating packaging waste has generated considerable debate. On one side, there are those who argue that manufacturers and supermarkets bear a moral responsibility to lessen their use of packaging. This argument holds weight since these businesses possess the resources and expertise needed to develop and implement sustainable packaging options. For example, several companies have successfully transitioned to biodegradable or recyclable materials, leading to substantial reductions in waste. Furthermore, manufacturers and retailers have the capacity to influence the entire supply chain by encouraging eco-friendly practices among their suppliers and partners.Conversely, some contend that customers must take responsibility by making informed choices and steering clear of products with excessive packaging. This viewpoint is also valid, as consumer behavior can significantly shape market dynamics. When shoppers consistently opt for items with minimal or environmentally friendly packaging, it signals to manufacturers and retailers the demand for sustainable alternatives. For instance, many personal care brands have begun offering refillable products, which not only cut down on packaging waste but also provide consumers with more economical options.In my view, both manufacturers and consumers share the responsibility for reducing packaging waste. While manufacturers have the ability to innovate and create sustainable packaging solutions, consumers can drive market demand through their purchasing choices. Ultimately, a collaborative approach involving producers, consumers, and policymakers is essential for effectively addressing the issue of packaging waste. By working together and embracing a comprehensive strategy, we can significantly diminish the environmental impact of packaging and foster a more sustainable future.

Others, however, think that change is always a good thing.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people rather doing the same things over and over avoiding change, meanwhile others consider change as a positive thing. Some people are probably afraid of change and for this reason they prefer staying in the confort zone because it's something familiar. On the other hand, others believe that change is a good opportunity to grow and discover new things.Changing it's not for everybody, because there are people that doesn't like it, so they try to avoid it. Spending the whole life doing the same thing is not as bad as change for some people. This is probably linked to the fact that sometime change is something unknown. So, sometime people prefere to stay in their confort zone because even if it's not the best at least is something familiar. For example, people that hate their jobs but are stuck with it, is because they're too afraid to change it and land in a worse place or position. So they rather stay in that place because they're too afraid to lose it and end up worse. I believe that this is an understandable and common reason around people, however i believe that change can give more chances for improvement.Other people believes that change is always a positive thing. Changing is an opportunity to grow and discover new things, It's a chance to achieve something better and improve. There are people who doesn't like to be in the same place (phisically, economically or emotionally) and prefer changing. For instance, going to a new country because the idea of living in the same place forever is not charming enough, so find out new places to see, and places to feel confortable ,emotionally and economically for instance, is something that only people who are hungry enough of change would do it. I believe that sometime it's better risk it than live the same life everyday.In conclusion, the preference about change depends on people and wheter is beneficial or not depends on the different point of views and situations. I think, that change is important, everything change even if try to avoid it. So, it's better embrace it because no matter how things go it will leave you either with an experiece or with a lesson. So, in my opinion change is a good thing.;The discussion surrounding the impact of change—whether it is advantageous or harmful—has ignited passionate debate among people. Some individuals cling to routines and resist change, valuing the comfort and security that familiarity offers. They contend that stability stems from consistency, and shifting one’s circumstances can usher in uncertainty and disorder. For example, someone who has spent their whole life in the same community may feel a profound sense of belonging and may be reluctant to move to a different city.Conversely, many argue that change is inherently positive, as it opens doors to fresh experiences, opportunities, and opportunities for personal development. They maintain that a life devoid of change becomes stagnant and monotonous, resulting in boredom and unhappiness. Take, for instance, an individual who has never ventured beyond their hometown—such a person may feel motivated to explore new cultures and forge new connections, broadening their perspective and enhancing their self-assurance.I firmly believe that change is crucial for personal growth and progress. While routines may provide comfort, they can also lead to complacency and inertia. Change—whether it involves a new job, a fresh hobby, or relocating—compels people to adapt and grow, fostering resilience and self-understanding. Moreover, change often presents new opportunities and experiences that can enhance life and instill a sense of fulfillment. For instance, someone who dares to launch their own business may face challenges, but they also gain a true sense of pride and accomplishment.In summary, even though some might prefer to evade change, I strongly advocate for its necessity and benefits in life. Change introduces novel experiences, opportunities, and avenues for personal growth, contributing to a richer and more meaningful existence. By embracing change, individuals can step outside their comfort zones and uncover new facets of themselves, leading to greater confidence and self-awareness.
149;Write about the following topic.Some people think living in big cities is bad for people’s health.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In the past decades, the rise of urbanization has brought trends of moving into the cities. While some people believe that the availability of resources and welfare in metropolises can outweigh the unhealthy environment, I strongly believe that the fancy infrastructures come in exchange for health sacrifice.To begin with, most megacities are overpopulated. With scarce resources and higher demands in every aspect, products and services received in these bustling locations usually come at a higher price, lower quality and longer waiting time. For example, it could take up to weeks or months to queue up for non-urgent medical services while it takes only a few days or even without booking in non-busy areas. Moreover, the nature of crowded areas accelerates the spreading of transmittable diseases during the pandemic.Another undeniable health factor for those residing in cities is pollution. Most cities come with traffic issues where there are exceeding amounts of cars which create air pollution. It is proved that, in long term, smog in the air could result in respiratory diseases such as lung cancer. Furthermore, the number of the city's population is equal to the extremely large amount of waste and without an appropriate waste management system, it could lead to several more problems. One of them is pests such as mice and bugs which are the perfect mediums for severe diseases such as rabies.All in all, urbanization has tremendous benefits to human society as a whole and is unavoidable in the present context. Thus, governments should focus on addressing these issues to ensure the sustainable progress of cities and the citizens' quality of life.;The idea that residing in large cities can harm people's health has ignited a lively discussion. Personally, I have a mixed opinion on this matter. While major urban areas provide a plethora of advantages, including access to top-notch medical facilities and a variety of employment options, they also present considerable health challenges.On one side, large cities often suffer from air and noise pollution, which can result in respiratory issues and other health complications. For example, research conducted in Tokyo, Japan, showed that elevated levels of air pollution were connected to a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases among the city's inhabitants. Furthermore, the hectic and demanding lifestyle typically associated with city living can adversely affect mental health, increasing the likelihood of anxiety and depression.Conversely, metropolitan areas serve as centers for medical advancement and excellence, granting residents access to specialized healthcare services and innovative treatments. Many cities are also filled with parks, green spaces, and recreational facilities that encourage physical activity and relaxation. For instance, the High Line in New York City, an elevated park constructed on a former railway, offers a serene retreat from the busy urban environment, fostering both physical activity and mental wellness.In summary, although living in large cities can negatively impact health, it is not wholly detrimental. With the availability of advanced medical care and opportunities for physical engagement, urban living can promote health if individuals are aware of the potential risks and take steps to address them. Ultimately, striking a balance between the advantages and disadvantages of city life is essential for maintaining good health.

While some advocate for art as an indispensable aspect of a child's education, others view it as a frivolous activity. In this essay, I will explore both perspectives and share my stance on the subject.On one side, there are those who consider art a luxury that educational institutions cannot afford, particularly when they feel compelled to prioritize more ""practical"" subjects such as math and science. They contend that art lacks relevance in preparing students for the job market, seeing it as an inefficient use of time and resources. Consequently, in many schools, art programs are often the first to be eliminated when budgets tighten.Conversely, I am firmly convinced that art is a crucial area of study for children. It nurtures creativity and self-expression while also developing critical thinking, fine motor skills, and hand-eye coordination. Art classes offer children a platform to convey their thoughts, gain confidence, and unleash their imagination. Additionally, art is a fundamental part of our cultural and historical narrative, and engaging with it enables children to understand and appreciate their surroundings. For instance, art projects can illuminate various historical eras, cultural movements, and social challenges, fostering empathy and open-mindedness in young learners.In summary, while some may dismiss art as unimportant, I strongly assert that it is a key component of a well-rounded education. The unique advantages and skills acquired through art education cannot be replicated elsewhere. By integrating art into school curricula, we can cultivate a generation of innovative, empathetic, and well-adjusted individuals prepared to thrive in all aspects of life."
221;Write about the following topic.Some people think that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is believed that responsibility for the rise in obesity in children is on government. I strongly disagree with this opinion. I think that state policy cannot lead to the people's obesity. Moreover, I am sure that only parents are responsible for their children diseases.First of all, it is important to say that government's actions can not be followed with the obesity. It is responsible only for control that all available products are not dangerous for people's health. Food that consist of a lot of fats do not put your health under the threat after the first consumption. Only overeating of this kind of food can be harmful for your health leading obesity. For instance, there is no government's responsibility if you go to the mall and buy 6 cans of beer providing health problem for yourself. I am sure that government is responsible only for making 1 can of beer acceptable for your health.Secondly, children's actions and potential consequences of these actions should be controlled by their parents. Obesity can be a result of a permanent overeating. Because of their age, chilldren cannot control themselves. That is why this responsibility goes on their parents. As it was mentioned before, there is no product that can be harmful for the healh after the first and the only consumption. There is no reason to condemn government because of the permanent consumption of any products. For example, child could eat 3 pieces of cake insted of 1 just because of his wish. In this case, his parents should stop him after the first one to avoid potential obesity.In conclusion, I would like to say that I do not see any reasons to say that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children. It has no responsibility for people's overeating and lack of parents' control over their children.;The growing issue of childhood obesity has ignited a passionate discussion regarding who bears the responsibility for this trend. While some individuals attribute the blame to the government, I hold a more nuanced viewpoint. I believe the government does have a significant role, but it is not the only party accountable.On one hand, the government can indeed be seen as partly responsible for the surge in childhood obesity through its policies and regulations. For example, it can influence the food industry by establishing standards for nutritional values and advertising techniques. When the government does not enforce strict regulations, companies may continue to market unhealthy foods aimed at children, exacerbating the obesity crisis. Additionally, funding decisions related to physical education and recreational resources in schools can greatly affect how much physical activity children can partake in. Limited funding often results in fewer opportunities for children to exercise and maintain an active lifestyle.Conversely, I contend that parents and individuals play a crucial role in combating childhood obesity. Parents are responsible for ensuring their children eat a balanced diet and are encouraged to be physically active. Furthermore, schools and communities can foster healthy lifestyles by providing sports programs, cooking classes, and other initiatives that promote wellness. For instance, several schools have implemented gardening programs where students learn to cultivate and prepare their own fruits and vegetables, thereby nurturing healthy eating habits.In summary, while the government has an obligation to foster an environment that supports healthy living, I do not believe it is solely responsible for the rising rates of childhood obesity. Addressing this issue requires a collaborative effort involving parents, schools, communities, and individuals to educate and inspire children to make healthy choices. By joining forces, we can build a society that prioritizes and promotes the health of its youngest members.
565;Write about the following topic.Some people think that it is more beneficial to take part in sports which are played in teams, like football. But others think taking part in individual sports is better, like swimming. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"There are lots of benifits in both party of sports which is group sports and individual sports. Many argue that one is better than another. By analyzing my personal experience, both side advantages and disadvanteges will be discussed.Health, the main factor that make people doing the sport in some extent. Many sports help body to increase the metabolism and keep our figure look slim. For example, like swiming, the sport is well-known for beauty body buidling, many reaserch show that water pressure form muscle into more dynamic beautiful shape than any other sport regardless of safty issues which part of events were practice in open water.Compare to swiming, a group sport like soccer game need 22 players participate into the field. Average soccer player have very powerful core strenth, in order to compete in this match, soccer player need to wear certain protection to prevent from injury such as foot pad to reduce the impact from side kick from other players and ankel protector. Undoubtly, soccer players have most strong body among many sports. However, they are the group of people most likely get injuryed more frequently.Sport also can build trust and friendship between people. In this aspect, both individual sports and group sports are proven that partipating in group games or competing with another player on a 1v1 match can increase the improvement of sportsmanship between people. Like olympic motto, ""stonger, faster and higher"", a good sport can bring people together and compete each other in a fair and friendly enviornment. However, individual sport may get boring faster than group sports due to lack of competition.In conclusion, neither group sports nor individual sports are perfect in every aspects. It is important to found a sport suit for each individual personal interest. All kinds of sports always carry benifits with dangerous if people do not do it well.";The discussion about the advantages of team sports versus individual sports has persisted for years. While some advocate for the benefits of team activities such as football, others contend that individual pursuits like swimming hold greater value. In this essay, I will examine both perspectives and share my viewpoint.On one side, team sports offer a variety of advantages. They encourage camaraderie, collaboration, and effective communication among players. These sports teach individuals how to strive for a shared objective, foster trust, and leverage each other’s strengths. For example, in football, players must synchronize their movements, provide mutual support, and devise strategies collectively to secure victory. This aspect of teamwork can cultivate strong connections among teammates and enhance their social skills.Conversely, individual sports such as swimming bring their own unique benefits. They allow athletes to concentrate on their personal performance, establish individual goals, and cultivate self-discipline. Individual sports also alleviate the pressure of depending on others, enabling athletes to take complete ownership of their achievements and setbacks. For instance, a swimmer can focus solely on perfecting their technique, pacing, and endurance without any concern regarding their teammates’ performances.In my view, team sports are more advantageous because they present a distinctive blend of physical and social benefits. Engaging in team sports not only enhances physical fitness but also develops social skills, emotional intelligence, and mental resilience. While individual sports do have their merits, team sports offer a more comprehensive experience that can positively impact various aspects of life. Furthermore, team sports often foster a sense of community and belonging, which can serve as a strong motivator for athletes to strive for improvement and persistence. Overall, I believe that team sports such as football are more beneficial than individual sports like swimming, as they provide a wider array of benefits that enhance both physical and emotional well-being.
189;Write about the following topic.Some people think that we should divide students based on their academic ability, while others think we should educate all students together. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people argue that students who have noticeable abilities and nice educational skills in academics should be separated during the learning process. The other says that it is no object who a better in education who not they should study together. I believe that it is terrible idea to include separation among students.On the one hand, when students with strong and weak academic abilities educate separately, teachers could control the learning process more thoroughly. In this way the teacher could give them more difficult tasks and focus on really relevant topics. A good example of this are private schools with fees and entering exams. It is the fact that there students in final classes have better knowledge than in common schools.On the other hand, when students with different skills educate together the strong students will help weak ones. In these classes there are standards and all students should follow them and there are opportunities to ask schoolmates how to solve some task correctly. The nice example of this is my school. If I did not know how to solve a task I would have a chance to wait for help from my more wise mate.In conclusion, although separate education will give a chance to learn a lot of difficult tasks and it helps teachers, the losing way of asking help if you do not know how to solve the task would be devastating for the educational process. In addition, it could be separated by abilities and wisdom, anyway it is an awful idea.;The ongoing debate regarding whether students should be grouped by academic ability or taught in mixed-ability classrooms has persisted for years. Proponents of ability-based grouping argue that it enhances teaching and learning effectiveness. This method allows educators to customize their lessons to meet the needs of different groups, leading to improved academic performance. For example, advanced students can engage with challenging material, while those who are struggling can receive additional support. Such an approach helps alleviate boredom and frustration by enabling students to learn alongside peers with similar abilities.Conversely, others contend that educating students together fosters social skills, equality, and inclusivity. When students of varying abilities learn side by side, they can cultivate essential life skills such as teamwork, communication, and empathy. Mixed-ability classrooms also help dismantle social barriers and challenge stereotypes, as students learn to appreciate one another's unique strengths and weaknesses. For instance, a student who excels in math may assist a classmate having difficulty with the subject, while the latter can offer help in areas like language arts.Personally, I believe that integrating all students in the same classroom is the more advantageous approach. It not only nurtures a sense of community and social responsibility but also equips students for real-world scenarios where individuals from diverse backgrounds and abilities collaborate. Furthermore, with effective teaching strategies and adequate resources, educators can address the varying needs of all students, regardless of their academic proficiency. This creates a more inclusive and supportive educational environment that values the unique talents and strengths of each learner. Ultimately, teaching all students together is crucial for enhancing academic success, fostering social unity, and promoting personal development.
569;Write about the following topic.Some teachers think that international student exchange would be beneficial for all teenage school students.Do you think its advantages will outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The international student exchange is getting more popular in many high schools in big cities. This operation brings many advantages which would be beneficial for teenager students. Though, here some disadvantages still exist.Firstly, I think one of disadvantages is that lack of supervision on the international exchange teenagers as they are living in other countries. In general speaking, the youths felt strange and inadaptable at initial period. They can’t speak well foreign language, can’t communicate well with other classmates or teachers, so they might feel alone and isolate from a new circumstance. If they can’t adjust themselves well to fit in with groups as soon as possible, they will encounter more difficult things, such as studying, social and daily routine. The worse situation is that they might give up their studying, even they will mislead them into crime.On the contrary, the advantages are far more than disadvantages. For example, youths will extend their horizons. They will see and know many new things what they never seen in domestic. They would easily accept those new things than adults, because youths have curiosities all long. Furthermore, the teenagers easier to make new friends in other countries, because they are always passion and single-minded. In order to communicate with different background students from all over the world, they must cultivate their social capacities harder than before. It is the best way to elevate their skills of the foreign language is communication. Moreover, through the different viewpoint collisions the international exchange students have gained multiple and scientific logics, which will have a profound impact at the rest their lives. However, I think the simplest advantage is that most the international exchange students have possessed with an excellent foreign language ability after then come back.At the end of my essay, I think it is not suit for all teenagers to be the international exchange students. Here the teenagers must accept some selection processes under the fair and effective principles.;The idea of international student exchange has gained considerable traction in recent years, with many educators asserting that it offers invaluable experiences for teenage students. I believe that the benefits of such programs far surpass any potential downsides, and they can profoundly influence the lives of young individuals.A key advantage of international student exchange is the chance for cultural immersion. Living and studying in another country allows students to gain a richer understanding of diverse cultures, societies, and lifestyles. This experience can expand their viewpoints, nurture empathy and tolerance, and help them evolve into more open-minded and globally conscious citizens. For instance, a student coming from a conservative background who spends a semester in a more liberal nation may return home with a renewed perspective on social issues and a heightened appreciation for diversity.In addition, these programs can equip students with essential language skills and academic experiences. By attending school in a foreign country, students can enhance their language abilities, discover new educational methodologies, and tap into a broader array of academic resources. For example, a student who participates in a language exchange in Japan might return proficient in the language, along with competencies that make them highly attractive in the job market.While some may contend that international student exchange can be expensive, logistically complex, and emotionally challenging for young people, I firmly believe that the advantages significantly outweigh these concerns. With proper planning, guidance from educators and host families, and a readiness to embrace new experiences, teenagers can thrive in international exchange programs and gain transformative experiences that shape their futures. In conclusion, I strongly advocate for international student exchange as an enriching opportunity that empowers teens with the skills, knowledge, and perspectives needed to excel in an increasingly interconnected world.
1003;Write about the following topic.Some universities now offer their courses on the Internet so that people can study online.Is this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It has become a popular trend that many universities have sent online courses for people to acquire knowledge through the Internet, which makes it more and more available for people to gain valuable resources and improve themselves. From my perspective, such a trend contains much benefits and it is undoubtedly a positive development.On the one hand, people can have more access to their interested expertise and delve into related fields with the help of online courses offered by universities. It is comparatively hard and inconvenient for people to attend courses in the university if they are not college students. Luckily, with myriads of online courses which are usually free and of high quality, learners merely need to register and sign in to find out some interesting courses ranging from academic knowledge to practical skills, which can afford a challenging but exciting experience for those attend the lessons.On the other hand, it is a good way for the universities to improve the quality of the courses as well as make some adaptation to the content of the courses. In order for people outside the universities to acquire knowldege effectively, online courses should cater to people's preference to some extent. It is expectable that some courses which is of great necessity and closely connected with people's daily life would be popular. Thus, universities would therefore release more high-quality courses by innovating teaching skills to meet people's needs.In conlusion, I think online courses provided by universities can surely make a positive impact on society because people who have the desire to acquire knowledge can enjoy sufficient resources without boundaries, which enhances individual's rights to grasp knowledge and facilitates the improvement of higher education in the long run.;The rise of online courses from universities has ignited a lively discussion regarding their implications. I believe that this trend is predominantly beneficial. One significant advantage of online courses is their ability to enhance educational accessibility. Students from remote locations or those with physical disabilities can now access a wide array of courses without needing to relocate or compromise their well-being. For example, a friend living in a rural area was able to enroll in an online program offered by a prestigious university, something that would have been unfeasible for her had she needed to attend in person.Another key benefit of online courses is their flexibility. Learners can arrange their study schedules to accommodate work or family obligations, allowing for a better balance of various responsibilities. This flexibility is especially advantageous for working professionals seeking to improve their skills or continue their education without taking a break from their careers. Additionally, many online courses offer self-paced learning, permitting students to progress at their own speed and alleviating the anxiety often linked to traditional classroom environments.On the other hand, some critics argue that online courses lack the personal interaction and hands-on experiences found in conventional classrooms. While this concern holds some validity, numerous universities are now integrating virtual discussions, online labs, and various interactive tools to address these shortcomings. Furthermore, online courses often connect students and instructors from around the globe, creating an invaluable network for exchanging ideas and gaining diverse insights.In summary, the proliferation of online courses represents a positive advancement with the potential to democratize education, enhance flexibility, and deliver a quality learning experience. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that online courses will grow increasingly advanced and effective, further narrowing the divide between traditional and online education.
531;Write about the following topic.The issue of gay marriage remains controversial. Some people think that this trend has adverse effects on the society while others believe that it is seen as a natural trend and right for people to choose this type of marriage. Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Recently, many countries have legalized gay marriage. However, there are many people who do not agree with that, and claim that it has a bad influence on the education of children, and the evolution of society. However, in my opinion, I think it is a good opportunity for homosexual people as they are now understood by others, and have the right to have children despite of their situation.To begin, there are many parents, for example, who tend to believe that because of the access to gay marriage, their children will find it normal to fall in love with a person from the same sex. As a result, more and more children will become homosexual, which is unconventional as far as the parents are concerned. However, I believe that it is not because children understand the fact that being gay is normal, that they will be influenced by this. In fact, they will be able to compassionate for people who struggle to express their homosexuality, so they will help them to feel more comfortable with that. Moreover, they will be more open-minded which is very important for children development.Secondly, many other people are convinced that gay marriage will inevitably tends towards a decrease of the young population as gay individuals can not have their own kids. As a consequence, This phenomenon represents a threat because young people will not be able to take over for the future. However, I am not of this opinion. I think that such a decrease in young people population will not occur as the vast majority of the world's population in not homosexual. Moreover, by allowing gay marriage, gay couples will be able to adopt children. Indeed, due to the fact that they are not able to give rise to new-born, they can adopt children who are abandonned, and give them the opportunity to live in a new family with good conditions.To conclude, I firmly believe that gay marriage is a good opportunity for the development of the society. Indeed, not only it makes children more open-minded, which is important for their own development, but also gives for those who are unfortunately abandonned, a safe environment to thrive in.;The topic of gay marriage has ignited vigorous discussions in recent years, with some individuals staunchly opposing it while others ardently advocate for it. I believe that gay marriage should be legalized, as it represents a fundamental human right for people to choose their partners without regard to sexual orientation.A prominent argument against gay marriage is that it threatens traditional family values and societal norms. However, this viewpoint stems from outdated and discriminatory beliefs toward the LGBTQ+ community. In contrast, legalizing gay marriage fosters equality, acceptance, and inclusivity—qualities essential for a healthy and progressive society. For example, nations like Canada, the UK, and Australia have embraced gay marriage, resulting in positive effects on the mental health and overall well-being of LGBTQ+ individuals.Additionally, denying same-sex couples the right to marry constitutes discrimination, which can severely impact their emotional and psychological health. It may also lead to social isolation and stigma, hindering their ability to integrate within society. Conversely, legalizing gay marriage can enhance social cohesion, diminish prejudice, and promote acceptance of diversity.In summary, gay marriage should be recognized as legal, as it pertains to human rights, equality, and personal freedom. It is crucial to understand that love and commitment transcend boundaries, and individuals should have the freedom to choose their partners, irrespective of their sexual orientation. By legalizing gay marriage, we can build a more inclusive, accepting, and equitable society where everyone can lead their lives with dignity and respect. Ultimately, it is vital to prioritize love, acceptance, and equality over outdated societal norms and biases.
293;Write about the following topic.The most important function of music is that it helps people reduce stress. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many today have come to the conclusion that the most significant effect on people of music is to relieve stress. While I agree that music also has more important positive functions other than reducing stress.On the one hand, I have to admit that music is a good way to reduce stress and it do plays an important role in our daily life. A good example of this can be seen in Shanghai, where has a large number of single karaoke rooms in the office buildings. As we all know, compared to the others cities in China, the people living in Shanghai face more stress, like the surprisingly high price of house and the fierce competition of work. Those public karaoke rooms, which were provided by the government for the public, become a good place for people to enjoy the music and have fun.On the other hand, for many people, music is an ideal career to persue in their life, like the job as an accountant, which can bring them with incomes and improve their living standard. For example, the TV programs related to music attract more and more people to participate in, like The Voice. Most of the participants wish to show their excellent peformance in music through these stages with the purpose of having access to more business opportunities and making more money at the same time. It is undeniable that the following income would be exponential increased than before if they succeed finally.In conclusion, it is not doubt that music is very essential for us, not only for its spiritual meanings, but also for its more important role in our society which could allow the person to relise their dream while creating more economical benefits.;The idea that the primary function of music is to help individuals reduce stress is a topic of considerable debate. While I acknowledge that music plays a significant role in alleviating stress, I believe it is not the only or even the most important function it serves. Music fulfills a variety of roles, such as self-expression, entertainment, and reflecting cultural identity, all of which are equally vital.On one hand, it is irrefutable that music can effectively reduce stress levels. Studies have indicated that listening to calming melodies can decrease cortisol levels and promote relaxation. For instance, research has shown that patients who listened to soothing music during surgical procedures experienced less anxiety and required lower doses of anesthesia. Personally, I have found that listening to classical music during exam seasons has helped me concentrate and ease my exam-related stress.Conversely, music also serves as a powerful means of self-expression, cultural preservation, and societal commentary. It has the unique ability to stir emotions, foster a sense of identity, and challenge societal norms. Events like music festivals, concerts, and live performances create opportunities for people to come together, promoting a sense of community and social connection. Additionally, music has historically been a catalyst for social movements, inspiring change and encouraging unity.In conclusion, while music certainly plays a crucial role in stress relief, its significance goes far beyond this one function. The varying purposes of music—including expression, entertainment, and cultural preservation—make it an integral and multifaceted aspect of human existence. Thus, I can only partially agree with the assertion that stress reduction is music's most important role, acknowledging its value in alleviating stress while recognizing its deeper and broader influence on human life.

Finding solutions to reduce traffic is very crucial. I totally agree that if people travel less from home to work or to education or even for shopping can reduce the amount of traffic. With the covid 19 outbreak pandemic we saw how much the working from home and using the zoom application for studying reduced the traffic in cities. People now are using online for shopping too. We know that traffic can be reduced if less consumers are using the roads. However, I dont agree that this is the only way to reduce traffic. Other strategies to reduce traffic are :1. Planning the roads and building the road bridges in a smarter way with special lanes for public transportation.2. Encourging people to use light trails, public transportations and to use car pools.3. Building special lanes for motorcycles and electric bikes.4. The governoment can put more regulations regarding how many cars each family can have.5. Increasing the vehicles prices and reduce the public transportation tickets.6. Educate people on the consequences of traffic and how it can inadverntly affect their life.7. Encourge people to walk more and to choose a work that is close to your home.As I mentioned above there are many strategies that can help in reducing tranffic and only by reducing the need for people to travel from home. I think i people travel less it abviously can reduce the traffic but we need a multi strategy with the collaberations of many sectors to successfly reduce traffic in cities.;The idea that the only way to reduce traffic congestion in cities is to minimize the need for individuals to travel from home for work, education, or shopping is a subject of debate. While I recognize that cutting down on daily commutes can help ease traffic, I don't entirely agree that it is the only available solution.On one side, decreasing the necessity for travel can lead to a significant reduction in traffic volume. For example, the increase in remote work and flexible job arrangements has resulted in fewer vehicles on the roads. Likewise, the growth of online education and virtual shopping options further lessens the demand for physical travel. Cities like Tokyo and Singapore illustrate this approach, promoting remote work and offering online services, which have contributed to less traffic congestion.Conversely, there are alternative and effective strategies for alleviating traffic congestion. Enhancing public transportation systems, investing in infrastructure that caters to pedestrians and cyclists, and employing smart traffic management techniques can also make a substantial impact. Cities like Copenhagen and Vancouver have successfully integrated these methods, demonstrating a reduction in traffic without exclusively depending on the minimization of travel needs. Additionally, traffic congestion often stems from deeper issues, such as urban planning challenges and insufficient green spaces, which also require attention.In summary, while decreasing the necessity for daily commutes can help to mitigate traffic congestion, it is not the only answer. A comprehensive strategy that includes improvements in public transportation, urban planning, and infrastructure is essential for effectively reducing traffic in urban areas. By recognizing and implementing a blend of these approaches, cities can strive to create more sustainable, efficient, and less congested environments for their residents.
235;Write about the following topic.There are several factors that motivate people to stay in the workforce, and money is the most important reason/factor. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The topic of motivation for work has merely failed to be discussed. Someone elaborate that the most significant factor is money while others suppose it is not. As far as I am concerned, although money is of great importance, it cannot always be the most valuable one.Undoubtedly, money can be a crucial factor to diminish the financial burden of families, especially for those who were born in a poverty-stricken area. To be more specific, only by earning sufficient money can they raise their later generations and keep the elderly. Provided that they cannot find a decent job that allow them to own some disposable money, it would add insult to injury.However, there are a great number of factors that may be considered as worthwhile to be the motivation of stay in the staff by some people. First of all, being in the workforce can help to strengthen an individual’s interpersonal skills. It is widely acknowledged that there are a colossal number of activities as well as team programmes that require people to collaborate, compromise and compete with the others. Thus, individuals will tend to learn some social skills and become gregarious and sociable, which can help them better adapt themselves to the mainstream society. In addition, people may also get a chance to broaden their horizons and lay a firm basis for future development by staying in the workforce. For instance, under the circumstance that numerous companies may provide the staff with the opportunity to go abroad and get involved in some international programs, people are able to get access to different cultures. As a result, people can develop panning-for-gold thinking rather than sponge-feeding thinking in the process of understanding divergent cultures, which can be beneficial for their future careers.In conclusion, although money is valuable for individuals to be in the workforce, there are many other factors that cannot be overlooked. Only by treating all the factors rationally can we enjoy the pleasure rather than pressure.;The idea that money is the primary motivator for individuals to remain in the workforce is a topic of much discussion. Although I acknowledge that financial compensation is an important aspect, I do not believe it is the only or the most critical reason. In my view, there are several other elements that are essential in encouraging people to stay in their jobs.On one side, it is clear that money serves as a crucial motivator, as it is necessary for survival and allows individuals to provide for themselves and their families. Many people work to meet their financial needs and attain stability, which is a basic human necessity. For instance, someone in a low-wage job might feel compelled to remain in their position solely for the financial benefits, especially if they lack alternative means of support.Conversely, I hold that various other aspects, such as personal fulfillment, job satisfaction, and a sense of purpose, are equally significant. Numerous individuals choose to stay in their jobs because they derive meaning and pleasure from their work, or they experience a sense of achievement and acknowledgment. For example, a teacher may continue working because they find joy in educating and inspiring students, rather than just seeking financial rewards. Likewise, someone in a creative profession might be driven by the chance to express themselves and realize innovative ideas, rather than focusing solely on monetary gain.In summary, while financial considerations are certainly a vital element in motivating individuals to stay in the workforce, I argue that they are not the most important factor. Elements such as personal fulfillment, job satisfaction, and a sense of purpose significantly influence people’s decisions to remain in their roles. Ultimately, a combination of financial and non-financial motivators drives individuals' choices, and it is the interaction of these factors that shapes their decisions to stay in or leave the workforce.
115;Write about the following topic.To meet the growing need for food to support an increasing population, a country should make use of edible insects as a food source. However, some people believe that insects are not only unhealthy but harvesting them will also negatively affect nature. What are the benefits and drawbacks of eating insects?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some countries and culture already utilize insects as part of food source. As such, it can be relatively inexpensive to consume insects - which are often freely found in certain environments and do not take much skill to be collected, killed and consumed - as compared to the cost and manual labor involved in raising animal livestock, butchering, as well as preparing the meat for consumption. Similarly agriculture also involves consistent manual labor, and has costs associated with it, including for machinery and materials needed. However, people may be against the idea of consuming insects due to the novelty of it, and they may also feel disgust around it. As the prompt states, some may find it unhealthy. Harvesting insects on purpose will also require some physical and psychological work - but the benefit here is that it may be easier than harvesting large animals or cultivating crops.I have never consumed an insect product - and my father has mentioned to me that had lived in such-and-such country, I would not be so scared of cockroaches - viewing them as a food source. He intended this to be an ironic comment, meant to comfor me somewhat due to my strong aversion to cockroaches. However, he may be correct! For individuals socialized in such a society, their aversion to roaches may be lower than mine. Hence, part of the issue here is socialization and accepting this new food norm, should it be novel to the individual and/or the country.I have tried an octopus for the first time when I was around 20 years old - as I was curious about this dish called Takoyaki, and had heard good reviews of it. It was not unpleasant to eat the ocotpus, per se, but I likely will not go back to it. All in all, new experiences, including consumption of new types of food, may create strong aversion at first, but once dip your toes into it, so to speak, it may be tamer than the experience you were expecting - even if you never go back to eating it again.;The global population is anticipated to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, which will put pressure on existing food resources. To tackle this challenge, some experts propose that edible insects could be a practical alternative. Although concerns exist regarding the health and ecological effects of entomophagy—the consumption of insects—there are several advantages and disadvantages to take into account.On the positive side, edible insects present a sustainable and nutritious source of food. Insects like crickets, mealworms, and grasshoppers are packed with protein, vitamins, and fiber. They also require far less land, water, and feed to produce compared to conventional livestock. For instance, producing one kilogram of beef demands approximately 1,000 liters of water, while only one liter of water is necessary for the same amount of crickets. Furthermore, insect farming can contribute to lower greenhouse gas emissions and support eco-friendly agricultural practices.Conversely, there are valid concerns regarding the health and environmental impact of insect harvesting. Some individuals worry that insects may harbor allergens, bacteria, or toxins that could pose risks to human health. Additionally, large-scale insect harvesting might disrupt natural ecosystems and threaten the survival of beneficial insect species. For example, excessive collection of wild insects could adversely affect vital processes like pollination and decomposition.In summary, while valid apprehensions regarding the health and environmental consequences of consuming insects exist, the advantages of entomophagy deserve attention. With appropriate farming and processing methods, edible insects can serve as a nutritious and sustainable food source. It is essential for governments, researchers, and farmers to collaborate in establishing guidelines and regulations that assure the safe and environmentally responsible production of insect-based foods. By investigating this alternative protein option, we can help satisfy the increasing food demand while fostering sustainable agriculture and minimizing our environmental impact.
131;Write about the following topic.With the improvements in today’s health care, society has to care for more and more elderly people.Do you feel that society will be able to cope with the increase in numbers of elderly people today and how can it be managed?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;I believe that all improvements in health care increase the number of elderly people, but those improvements also brings benefities in an way to care then.First of all, looking for a financial perspective, in generaly way, people became capable to work for a bigger period, getting retired older. So they could contributed more for any pension plan or those kind of program. We need to guarantee that our next governants will be capable to redesign the retire's program in an way to guarantee those beneffits to whole population.Looking by a health care perspective, all the improvments and medicine advance, it brings the possibilite to have a good life even allthough the years.For instance, we can see many people that healed from a bad ill like cancer or other ones and have a good life nowadays.This is the reason that elderly people is not a problem to our society, but in fact their represents more knowledge and we have all tecnology to take care about theirselfs.In other way we can see that our society open more space and are more concern with elderly population. We can see some places speciallyzed to take care of their and also a kind of intertainement focused on them, like some hotels, restauurants, clinics.In whole way our society are looking for treaty our elderly society in a decent way, respect them, make a enviroment friendly for their deficient and any dificult of mobility and any other issue that we need to cope to guarantee their activities.;"Recent advancements in healthcare have significantly extended human lifespans, leading to an increasingly large elderly demographic. Consequently, society now faces the challenge of providing adequate care for a rising number of older adults. I believe that with careful planning, management, and resource allocation, society can effectively address this growing need.A major concern is the financial strain associated with elderly care. As a larger segment of the population requires healthcare and social services, governments and healthcare systems will need to adapt to these demands. For example, Japan, which has a rapidly aging population, has introduced innovative solutions like robotic caregivers and elderly-friendly infrastructure to assist its senior citizens. Other nations can draw valuable lessons from Japan's experience to develop their own strategies for managing the financial and logistical hurdles of caring for older adults.Additionally, societal attitudes towards aging and elderly care must evolve. By encouraging intergenerational connections, community involvement, and volunteer initiatives, we can cultivate a sense of responsibility and kindness toward older individuals. One successful approach has been the introduction of ""adopt-a-senior"" programs, where younger people establish friendships with elderly neighbors, providing them with emotional support and practical assistance. These programs not only benefit seniors but also enhance the lives of the younger participants.In summary, while the growth of the elderly population poses significant challenges, I am confident that society can manage this shift through a comprehensive strategy. This includes investing in healthcare infrastructure, enhancing community engagement, and nurturing a culture of respect and care for older adults. By learning from examples like Japan and exploring innovative solutions, we can ensure our societies are well-prepared to support and empower the expanding elderly population."
933;Write about the following topic.Young people in the modern world seem to have more power and influence than any previous young generation.Why is this the case?What impact does this have on the relationship between old and young people?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"In modern times, the younger generation appear to be more powerful and influencial compared to the generations in times past. I believe this is as a result of younger people being more ascertive, stepping up to question and change existing societal norms and archaic cultures. At first, this may negatively affect their relationship with the older generation as a result of how unfamiliar they are to these changes but subsequently, the tension is bound to resolve, when the older generations come to accept these changes.To begin with, it is an open truth that young people these days tend to be very bold and outspoken and unlike their predecessors, are better at questioning norms that do not sit right with them and even going an extra mile to change these norms or cultures. A good example of this is seen in women empowerment and rights activism. In my part of the world, some years back, it was believed that a woman's place is in the kitchen and her sole job was to birth and rear children, therefore, women were not allowed to be educated or have paying jobs. Women in the older generation complied to this because it was the norm, but this is not the case in modern times, because many young women opposed to it and now, homes are even headed by women; the power of activism.Many people in the older generation are not familiar with young people being more outspoken and this is understandable because in their time, they were taught to only follow rules and not to question them. Therefore the fact that young people have become more outspoken and powerful is foreign to them and just like every human nature, whatever is foreign or different is automatically hated. As a result, there is likely going to be a tension between the 2 generations, however, with constant advocation and learning the tension is bound to resolve. For example, going back to women's rights activism, at the start, many older people were not on board as they did not think it was normal, however, there are now a lot of older people who have become activists.In conclusion, I believe that the power and influence the younger generation has is as a result of their ascertiveness and will to effect changes in their societies and even though it may cause a negative relationship with the older generation at first, subsequently, their differences is likely to be ironed out when the older generation learns to accept these changes.";The contemporary world has undoubtedly granted young people unprecedented power and influence. A significant factor behind this trend is the rise of social media and the internet, which have provided young individuals with a platform to voice their opinions, share their thoughts, and connect with peers around the world. This connectivity allows them to mobilize, organize, and advocate for the causes they are passionate about, thereby wielding considerable influence over societal issues.Additionally, the evolving landscape of work and education has played a crucial role in enhancing the agency of young people. With the emergence of entrepreneurship, freelancing, and online education, young individuals can pursue their interests and passions free from the constraints of traditional structures. This newfound freedom enables them to innovate, create, and lead across various fields, encompassing technology, the arts, social activism, and politics.The repercussions of this shift on intergenerational relationships are complex. On one hand, it has narrowed the generational divide, as older generations increasingly seek the insights and ideas of younger people. Many companies, for example, actively solicit feedback from younger employees to maintain innovation and competitiveness. Conversely, this dynamic can also generate tension, as some older individuals may feel intimidated by the growing influence of youth or struggle to comprehend their values and communication styles.In summary, the augmented power and influence of young people today stem from the digital revolution and the transformation of work and education. While this evolution has the potential to cultivate collaboration and understanding between generations, it also necessitates effort and willingness from both young and older individuals to adapt to the changing dynamics of their interactions. By valuing and learning from one another, both age groups can capitalize on the advantages of this shift, ultimately fostering a more inclusive and progressive society.
351;Write about the following topic:In many countries, not enough students study science subjects. What are the causes? What will be the effect on society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, there are many courses available to take, from arts that include theatre and music to scientific topics such as mathemathics, physics, chemistry, biology and medicine. There is an evidence that the amount of students willing to learn science subjects is not sufficient. In this essay I will discuss the causes of the issue and the possible effect on society.There are several casues for the fact that students tend to skip science subjects. First, studying science can be hard and exhausting. The complexity of some subjects such as math and physics requires from the student to study many hours at home. Secondly, there are students who do not only find those courses difficult, but also get low marks even after studying long hours. As for chemistry classes, some courses include labratory lessons which may not appeal to some students.The importance of people having knowledge in science is great. The society relies on science on a daily basis. For instance, doctors who study medicine, must know mathematics, biology and chemistry well, because biology is relevant to the patient's body. In addition, doctors prescribe medications so they must know chemistry well. Another example is architects whose job is to plan and design buildings. Without a proper knowledge in physics, they could not plan buildings.Discussing those facts, studying science can be challenging. However, it is vital for the society that students will study science. Without doctors, nurses, scientists and other professions that rely on science, the health of the society might be effected negatively.;The declining number of students choosing to study science subjects is a significant issue in numerous countries. A key factor contributing to this trend is the common perception that science subjects are exceptionally challenging, which discourages many students from pursuing them. Moreover, the shortage of qualified and motivating teachers in these disciplines often renders the subjects uninviting and unattainable for learners. Additionally, the focus on rote learning over hands-on experimentation and critical thinking in science education can dampen student interest and creativity.The repercussions of this trend will be extensive and significant. A decreasing number of science graduates will result in a lack of skilled professionals in crucial areas such as medicine, technology, and engineering, all of which are vital for fostering innovation and economic development. For instance, countries like Japan and South Korea, which have heavily invested in their science education systems, have seen substantial technological progress and economic success. Conversely, nations with weaker science education frameworks will find it challenging to meet the needs of an ever-evolving global landscape.If this pattern persists, society will face a shortage of expertise in significant fields, leading to reduced competitiveness and potential stagnation. To address this issue, governments and educational institutions must collaborate to reform science education, making it more engaging, accessible, and relevant to students' experiences. This can involve integrating more practical and project-based learning opportunities and enabling students to connect with professionals in scientific fields. By taking these steps, we can inspire and prepare the next generation of scientists, innovators, and leaders to confront the complex challenges of the 21st century.
1185;Write about the following topic:Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Poverty has been always a major issue around the world. Due to viruses, natural disasters, and poor management in the country and overpopulation, each day the poverty increases. In addition, some developed countries ignore the help or just give a temporary solution. Poverty has a great effect on the income that can lead to serious problems.To begin with, developed countries shouldn't only support with financial aid, as that kind of solution will not help the people. In my opinion, rich countries can stop poverty in such way to look for the natural resources of the poor country and to help and develop its resources. For example, in Africa they are famous for their large area of land. A rich country can take this opportunity to implement a long-term plan to benefit and fight poverty, such as to start expanding the lands of agriculture to use their natural resources such as cocoa, rice, and coffee. Furthermore, this idea can also help the people of the country where they can work on the land and be employed.Also, developed countries can donate and build health care centers and schools to prevent the dangerous disease from spreading. Schools can empower children to grow up and help the country's economy to rise and to fight poverty.In conclusion, developed countries can unite and discuss this significant concern rather than helping with financial support as poverty is taking the lives of many children. Poor countries just need better solutions and understanding from the world to prevent such problems from continuing to happen.;The idea that wealthy nations should offer non-monetary forms of support to poorer countries instead of just financial aid has ignited significant discussion. While I agree that money alone may not be enough to eliminate poverty, I also contend that it plays an essential role in a holistic development approach.On one side, financial aid has several disadvantages. It can foster dependency, disrupt local economies, and may be misappropriated by corrupt officials. Additionally, it has the potential to distort market signals, causing inefficient resource distribution. In some African nations, for instance, food aid has been known to undermine local farmers, making it increasingly difficult for them to compete. Thus, it is sensible to explore alternative support mechanisms such as technical training, education, and infrastructure enhancement.Conversely, financial aid can serve as a critical lifeline for countries facing poverty, conflict, or natural disasters. It can offer immediate relief, stabilize economies, and sustain essential social services like healthcare and education. A notable example is the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, where financial support from developed nations was crucial for emergency assistance and reconstruction efforts. In these instances, financial aid can act as a vital stopgap to avert humanitarian crises.In summary, while I agree that developed nations should explore alternative types of support, I don’t believe that financial aid should be completely dismissed. An integrated approach that combines financial support with technical assistance, capacity building, and investment in human resources is likely to be more effective in combating poverty and encouraging sustainable development. Ultimately, the most appropriate type of assistance will vary based on the unique needs and circumstances of each impoverished nation, necessitating a flexible and adaptable strategy to confront the complex challenges of global poverty.
343;Write about the following topic:Some people believe that it is important to spend a lot of money on family celebrations. While others think it is a waste of money. Discuss both views.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Spending money in family celebrations can be seen as a way of appreciating where one comes from. Although some people say it is a total waste of money, l assert that it is wiser.To begin with, many people feel that it is of no importance to consume money on family gatherings. This is because people usually have more pressing issues in life like urgent health cases that require money. Also, some struggle to provide basic needs for their families, for example, tuitions, decent meals and shelter. For these reasons, it seems using money on family gatherings is just a luxury.Despite the merits of the arguments above, although many say it is wasteful to financially cater for family parties, l assert that it is crucial. One reason is that, it unites families and a sweet spirit is maintained if family members are recognised for their special days such as wedding anniversaries, birthdays and graduations where money is spent. Further, appreciation to others within the family cannot be expressed in many ways without forking out some money.Furthermore, money has to be spent on family get togethers where everyone is in a joyous mood so that people can catch up and release stresses from their straining personal lives. What is more, culture, closeness and love is easily displayed when families come together for such celebrations and use money for their own satisfaction. For instance, when my childhood birthdays were celebrated, l felt so much loved and l still cherish the memories as l vividly can recall.To conclude, although others feel that it is money consuming to fund family gatherings, l advocate that it is a wiser option. Should this be the case, love within families would not wax cold and family members would feel more appreciated.;The discussion surrounding the necessity of spending substantial amounts on family celebrations has generated considerable debate. Proponents argue that investing in such events is crucial, as they foster lasting memories and enhance family connections. For example, a lavish wedding or a significant birthday celebration can serve as unique experiences that unite relatives and friends, cultivating a sense of unity and happiness. Additionally, extravagant gifts or elaborate decorations can heighten the excitement and make the occasion particularly memorable.Conversely, some individuals believe that spending extensively on family celebrations is an ill-advised use of resources. They argue that those funds could be better allocated toward more practical goals, such as saving for a child's education or making a down payment on a house. Furthermore, the pressure to overspend can lead to financial strain and debt for some families. A simple, intimate gathering can be just as enjoyable and meaningful as a grand affair, without the associated financial burden.In my view, both perspectives hold validity, and the choice to invest heavily in family celebrations ultimately hinges on individual circumstances and priorities. While it’s important to celebrate special occasions with enthusiasm, it’s equally essential to maintain awareness of one’s financial situation and prioritize necessary expenses. Ultimately, the strength of love and connection among family members is what truly matters, rather than the cost of the festivities. A balanced approach that takes into account both emotional significance and financial considerations can enable families to create enjoyable and meaningful celebrations without excessive spending.
1199;Write about the following topic:Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Is competition instructive or toxic for children? There is a debate around this topic. There are those who believe that a sense of competition should be supported. On the other standpoint, there are those who believe that rather that compete children have to learn how to co-operate. I believe that supporters of competicions are partly right but also that co-operation between children is essential. The two strategy can be taken together to give to childrens all the tools they need to became useful adults.On the one hand, there are people who believe that to compete is essential for the growth of children. They believe that competitions rise the ambitions of children. They develop certain attitudes thanks to which they will have always bigger dreams and desire. The idea, therefore, is that children who have grown making competiions will became important managers because of their instinctive desire to be winners and successful persons. It is true that competitions permit childrens to develop their ambitions and to do the best they can in order to win. However, I strongly believe that a good understanding of the aim of competitions should be taught before they start to compete. Indeed, children have to understand the instructive role of competition and how manage the possible distructive consequences that could derive if a child is not ready to lose. Children should start a competition being aware of the possibility of lose and the possibility to win. I believe that is important to stimulate children in doing competitions but teaching them the important role of defeats and the role of coperation. This lead me to analyse the second standpoint.There are, indeed, people who dislike competitions at all. They believe they are toxic for the growth of children. According to them, it is negative to teach children to be against between each other. Rather, children should learn how to work together and co-operate. Surely, co-operation is a vital skill in workplaces. The ability to work in team is one of the most searched by different businesses. To learn how to work together means for children to understand their role in a group and also to think about the ideas that should support the team itself. Co-operation then permits children to develop fundamental social skills. However, co-operation alone is not enough for children's instruction. I believe that co-operation is possible just if a child is also learning how to work and produce something alone. Children, in order to advances ideas and give a good support in a team, have to learn to be ambitious and this is possible thanks to competitions.In conclusion, I believe that an instruction in which single competitions as well as team-works are encouraged is the most useful and productive in order to grow up efficient adults.;The ongoing debate over whether children should be encouraged to compete or cooperate has persisted for years. Some argue that nurturing a sense of competition is crucial for their development. They believe that competition motivates children to work diligently, achieve more, and strive for excellence, effectively preparing them for the competitive realities of adulthood. For example, schools that emphasize competitive sports and academic contests often see students achieving higher levels of success, making them better suited for their future careers.Conversely, there are those who contend that teaching children to engage in cooperation is more advantageous. They assert that cooperation fosters teamwork, values, and social skills necessary for cultivating strong relationships and reaching shared goals. When children collaborate towards a common objective, they learn to recognize and value each other's strengths and weaknesses while developing empathy and understanding. A good illustration of this is a classroom project that requires students to work in groups to accomplish a common task, helping them build essential collaborative and communication abilities.In my view, a balanced approach that incorporates both competition and cooperation is the most effective strategy. While competition can motivate children to excel, excessive rivalry may lead to stress, anxiety, and an emphasis on individual triumph rather than group success. Similarly, while cooperation nurtures teamwork and social skills, it might not provide the necessary impetus for children to push themselves fully. By integrating both competitive and cooperative experiences into their upbringing, children can cultivate a strong work ethic, teamwork abilities, and a sense of social responsibility, ultimately becoming more capable and well-rounded adults.
397;Write about the following topic:Some people think that hosting an international sports event is good for the country, while some people think it is bad. Discuss both views and state your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;International sports events are one of the most trendy interactions at any hosting country. Depending on the hoster, the events could represent a virtue or a slip. This dependence is associated with the costs, logisitcs, marketing, etc. I tend to be of the opinion, that the virtues outweigh the disadvantages and that they shall be considered as opportunities to exploit.Some people think of the international sport events as being disadvantageous, because for example of being a pressure on the countries' infrastructure as well as the provided services and facilities. Another reason might emerge as some countries also might not be well-suited for such events. For instance, despite spending a big budget on the organisation of the event, the lack of qualified personnel or needed objects and materials shall cause a massive distruction of the hostees' experiences.The other perpective of the usages and utilization of such events could be clear through the massive amount of virtues, which these events normally brings to the hosting countries. For example, these events are regularly sponsored from international organisation, which provide the financial means not for only the logisitcs of the events, but additionally fees for the hosters. Furthermore, the financial benefits shall not stop by the provided fees through the owning organisation, but also the global or regional branding of such country will affect the tourism and the local service providers absolutely positive.Concluding, international sport events could be absolutely virtous, if the hosting countries were to implement their strategies successfully. Should such countries be willing to give the event the raw focus on the organisation and the user-experience, that would absolutely lead to massive benefits financially, marketing-wise and from intercultural perspective.;The ongoing debate about the advantages and disadvantages of hosting international sports events has ignited fervent discussions among people. Some argue that such events can bring significantly positive effects to a country. For example, they can enhance tourism, generate employment, and drive economic growth. The surge of visitors and media coverage can also highlight a nation's culture, history, and natural attractions, potentially enticing future investments and tourists. Notable instances, like the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2012 London Olympics, illustrate how hosting these major events can yield substantial financial returns and elevate a nation's profile on the global stage.Conversely, others contend that the negative repercussions of hosting international sports events can be considerable. The soaring expenses tied to constructing and maintaining cutting-edge infrastructure, including stadiums and venues, can impose a heavy strain on a nation's economy. Additionally, resources may be siphoned away from crucial public services, such as healthcare and education. For instance, the 2014 World Cup in Brazil triggered significant protests, as many felt that funding prioritized the event over pressing social and economic challenges.In my view, with careful management, hosting an international sports event can indeed be advantageous for a country. Thoughtful planning and budgeting can help ensure that the benefits of increased tourism, job opportunities, and global visibility outweigh potential downsides. Moreover, investment in infrastructure can lead to long-lasting benefits for national development, including improved transportation and sports facilities for the local population. However, it is essential for the host nation to uphold its commitments to public services and ensure that the event does not compromise the well-being of its citizens. Ultimately, a measured approach that takes into account both economic and social factors can transform hosting an international sports event into a significant opportunity for growth and advancement.

Each medium has its distinct merits, but I believe the Internet is the most superior for news consumption.To begin with, the Internet excels in convenience and accessibility. With just a few clicks, users can explore a massive range of news websites, blogs, and social media platforms that deliver real-time updates on unfolding events. This level of accessibility is particularly important in our fast-paced society, where being informed is essential. Unlike radio and TV, which operate on fixed schedules and offer limited coverage, the Internet allows for on-demand news browsing at any time, day or night.Additionally, the Internet provides a wealth of diverse news sources, allowing users to verify information and develop a comprehensive viewpoint. Online news platforms often present in-depth analyses, opinion pieces, and multimedia content, which enrich a reader’s understanding of complex topics. In contrast, radio and TV news usually deliver brief, superficial reports, lacking the depth and detail that online content provides.Furthermore, the interactivity afforded by online news is a significant benefit. Readers can comment on articles, participate in forums, and engage with content via social media, which fosters a sense of community and stimulates public discussion. This interactive aspect is mostly missing from traditional radio and TV news, which function as one-way communication channels.In summary, while radio and TV are still valuable news sources, the Internet’s convenience, variety, and level of interactivity make it the most effective medium for staying informed about current events. As technology progresses, it’s likely that online news will evolve further, cementing its status as the leading source of information.
1377;should children grow up in the city or countryside (advantages/disadvantages)?;Some people think it is better for children to grown up in the city, while others think that life in the countryside is more suitable for them. What are the advantages and disadvantages of both places?Living in the rural area is the best option for children by a group of people, while others believe that cities offer more opportunities. In my opinion, if the city offers security and green areas, I agree it is a better place to raise the next generation some advantages both sides.Firstly, the countryside in touch with nature, taking care of animals and helping with the gardening. Because of that, they learn how to protect the environment and to live without any technological equipment. Besides that, they have more freedom to play outside the house without any security worries, whereas in the city they are kept at home smartphones and computers for this reason. On the other hand, schools usually have lower quality and it is hard to find extracurricular classes. Therefore, children difficulties trying to develop their abilities besides the school curriculum.However, schools at metropolitan areas tend to have better quality and offer all kinds of activities. Even if there is a sport or an art course that the institution does not offer, it is possible to look for it in another place around the city. As a result, all children’s talents and passions can be easier to develop. On the other hand, security, pollution and contact with nature are issues that we have to worry about. The better option would be a city with an excellent quality of life where children could play in parks and gardens.To sum up, growing up in the countryside can be very positive for someone’s childhood, but the city will usually offer better opportunities for their talents’ development.This is a well written essay. It talks about all parts of the task and the arguments and ideas are extended and supported by some examples. The information is sequenced in a logical way and most of the ideas are linked using appropriate connective words. The choice of vocabulary is suitable to express the meaning of the writer, though in some instances word choice can be improved further (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows suggested corrections). Most sentences are error-free and demonstrate various levels of complexity. Overall this essay seems good enough to deserve IELTS Band 8.;The question of whether children should be raised in urban or rural settings has been a topic of discussion for many years. Each environment presents distinct advantages and disadvantages that can greatly influence a child’s growth and well-being.On one side, urban life offers numerous benefits. Cities are rich in educational and cultural resources, including museums, libraries, and theaters. Children in these areas are exposed to a variety of cultures, cuisines, and lifestyles, which can expand their worldviews and promote acceptance. Furthermore, cities generally provide better access to healthcare, schools, and vital services.Conversely, rural life has its own compelling advantages. The countryside offers a tranquil and peaceful atmosphere, free from the hustle and bustle of urban noise and pollution. Children in rural settings often have more room to play, explore, and connect with nature, fostering healthier lifestyles. Additionally, rural communities tend to be closer-knit, with familiar neighbors who provide support and create a safe environment for children to grow up in.Nonetheless, both settings come with their challenges. Urban areas can be crowded, noisy, and polluted, potentially harming a child’s physical and mental health. The fast-paced nature of city life might also induce stress among children. On the other hand, rural areas can be isolating, with limited access to essential services and fewer educational opportunities, which may restrict a child's social and academic development.Ultimately, whether a child thrives better in the city or the countryside depends on specific circumstances and family priorities. While both environments offer unique pros and cons, a combination of both could give children a well-rounded upbringing. Most importantly, what truly matters is providing a caring, nurturing, and stimulating environment for children, whether in urban or rural settings.
1379;should unpaid community work be mandatory in high school (agree/disagree)?;"Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programs (for example working for a charity, improving the neighborhood or teaching sports to younger children). To what extent do you agree or disagree?It is argued that voluntary services charity, cleaning the neighborhood, imparting knowledge to the underprivileged, should be made mandatory in the high school curriculum. I strongly agree as it not only helps in students becoming socially responsible adults but also in shaping their character.Firstly, community service inculcates a sense of responsibility towards the society, something that is needed to shape a good society. For instance, the introduction of Swatch Bharath scheme in my school, The Hyderabad Public School, ten years ago taught me not only to keep the surroundings of the school clean but also to never litter wherever I go. Hence, now I feel responsible to maintain cleanliness everywhere. Such services are needed to develop a better society in the future.Secondly, voluntary services cater to the overall character development of an individual. It a feeling of empathy in children which is needed to build a better character. For example, an alumnus of Montessori High School, who indulged in petty law-breaking activities during school confessed that it was the charity service that he did in high school; which in his mind; him in becoming a better person for his family and refrained him from committing socially irresponsible acts. Thus, such voluntary activities teach us to value what we have and in turn to our personality development.That being said, we cannot deny the fact that many students misuse the time allocated for these services by considering it as an excursion to enjoy with friends rather than a learning .In conclusion, although compulsory voluntary community service has its drawbacks, it is still useful in shaping a child as a socially responsible citizen and also in their overall personality development. Therefore, pupils should be encouraged to involve themselves in such activities.This is a well written essay. It addresses all parts of the task and the arguments and ideas are developed and supported. The information is presented in a logical order and the ideas are linked by appropriate connective words. The use of vocabulary conveys the exact meaning of the writer and there are only minor instances of a word being used somewhat unnaturally. Sentence formation demonstrates a high level of control and very few errors (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows suggested corrections). Overall this essay seems good enough for IELTS Band 8 level.";I firmly believe that mandatory unpaid community service should be a requirement in high schools. Integrating community work into the curriculum can have a tremendously positive effect on students. It cultivates a sense of social responsibility while also equipping them with essential life skills and experiences that are difficult to achieve in a conventional classroom.Requiring community service allows students to actively engage with their surroundings, grasp the needs of others, and develop empathy. This type of involvement can expand their perspectives, turning them into more compassionate and engaged members of society. Additionally, community work introduces students to various career options they may not have previously considered, including social work, healthcare, and environmental conservation.Furthermore, participating in unpaid community service helps students hone vital skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. Collaborating toward a shared objective teaches them to depend on each other’s strengths and support one another’s weaknesses, reflecting real-life professional settings. These competencies are advantageous not only for their future careers but also for their personal lives, making them more adaptable and resilient.Some critics argue that imposing mandatory community work adds an extra burden on students who are already stressed with academic demands. Nevertheless, the advantages significantly outweigh the drawbacks. Even a modest expectation, such as 20 hours per semester, can lead to substantial positive outcomes. This approach enables students to balance their academic responsibilities with community engagement, ensuring they gain valuable insights from both.In summary, mandating unpaid community service in high schools is a progressive educational approach. It prepares students to take active roles in their communities, provides them with necessary skills, and fosters a sense of responsibility and compassion. By weaving community service into high school education, we are not only developing better students but also nurturing responsible citizens for the future.
917;‘Failure is proof that the desire wasn’t strong enough’To what extent do you agree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Failure is what nobody wish for, but it could occur secondarily to an unsuccessful attempt towards ones goal, for various reasons. I am in the view that, failure is not a proof of lack of desire, rather it is more to do with improper techniques, less allocation of time and lack of proper attitude.It is the general view that, ultimate success in any field is taught through the failures in life. One can be subjected to multiple failures due to lack of ability to develop essential skill set, also known as techniques, that would be essential to achieve a certain goal. One classic example is Thomas Alwa Eddison, the great inventor of all time, who went through nearly 100 unsucessfull experiments, before inventing the light bulb. He was brave enough to accept the failure experiments had taught him 100 different impossible ways not to discover the light bulb.On the other hand, time plays one of the most crucial factors in obtaining a goal/success. By this I meant, the time that is allocated towards full filling tasks that are directed towards preparing for the goal. The little time is spent during the preparation, the further away the goal felt like. For an instance, one cannot expected to win a marothon with just one day preparation.Similarly, attitude plays by far the most striking part of the success. This is simple as, one cannot dream of becoming a good physician, having shown no interest in paying attention to people and their health related complaints.In a nut shell, failure is not a proof for inadequate desire in fact, failure is due to improper practices of techniques,failure of managing time in preparing and attitudes that fires the drive.;"The phrase ""Failure is proof that the desire wasn't strong enough"" implies that the level of one's desire is the only factor in achieving success. While I appreciate the sentiment behind this idea, I only partially agree. I believe that the connection between desire and success is more intricate.On one hand, it is true that a powerful desire can motivate individuals to pursue their goals relentlessly, which can lead to eventual success. For example, Thomas Edison's determination in developing the light bulb exemplifies how strong desire can help overcome obstacles. Despite numerous setbacks, his firm commitment ultimately resulted in success. In situations like this, one could argue that his desire was indeed potent enough to triumph over challenges.However, failure can arise from numerous factors that may be beyond an individual's control, such as insufficient resources, lack of proper guidance, or simply bad luck. For instance, a student may possess a strong desire to excel in a subject but may still struggle due to ineffective teaching or personal issues. In these instances, it would be unjust to deduce that their desire was lacking.Additionally, failure often provides valuable lessons and does not necessarily indicate insufficient desire. Many successful individuals, including J.K. Rowling and Stephen King, have recounted how their early failures ultimately contributed to their later achievements. Their experiences illustrate that failure can serve as a stepping stone to success rather than a sign of weak desire.In summary, while having a strong desire is certainly crucial for achieving success, I do not agree that failure alone indicates a deficiency in that desire. Various elements, such as circumstance, guidance, and luck, play a vital role in determining success. Thus, it is important to approach failure with a nuanced understanding, acknowledging both its capacity to reflect weak desire and its potential as a valuable learning opportunity."
1419;“Some people say that the education system is the only critical factor to development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?”;Education plays a vital role in the development of a country. Therefore, some people think that the education system is the only important factor to the development of a country and they may be right.Education is the foundation of developed society. It is rightly said, ‘education is a ladder success’. If all the people of any country are educated then they becomes broadminded, civilized and progressive. An educated society improves the standard of life as well., education also creates a good employment opportunity and therefore country does not have to suffer from big problems like unemployment. Educated peoples are more aware of such as pollution and many more. A country becomes technologically advanced because of educated people.Not only this, but also by giving importance to education, the nations can get rid of problems like , poverty, unemployment and population growth that delay the progress of a nation. The crime rate can also be kept under . The standard of living of the people will go up. If the nations to be progressive it is very important that the people are more educated and progressive. Any country can become more technologically advanced and developed because of education.However, there are other factors that also play an important role in the development of a country. Such as governments have to encouraged people to do soIn conclusion, I would like to say that a good education system will lead to a developed country.;The idea that the education system is the sole key factor in a country's development is a contentious issue. While I recognize the importance of education in promoting growth and advancement, I contend that it is not the only essential component.On one side, education is crucial in determining a nation’s future. It provides individuals with the skills, knowledge, and critical thinking abilities necessary for driving innovation, economic progress, and social improvement. An educated population is more apt to contribute to a nation's development by actively participating in the workforce, engaging in civic responsibilities, and adopting healthier lifestyles. Additionally, education creates a multiplier effect, empowering individuals to make informed decisions, challenge societal norms, and strive for enhanced living conditions.Conversely, many other elements contribute to a country's development, such as infrastructure, healthcare, governance, and economic policies. For example, a strong infrastructure facilitates the movement of goods, services, and people, enhancing trade and commerce. Likewise, a reliable healthcare system fosters a healthy workforce, which is essential for productivity and economic expansion. Effective governance and sound economic policies also cultivate an environment conducive to investment, innovation, and entrepreneurship—key factors in development.In summary, while the education system is undeniably a crucial aspect of a nation's development, it is not the only significant contributor. Other vital elements like infrastructure, healthcare, and governance also play essential roles in shaping a country's growth trajectory. Thus, adopting a comprehensive approach that encompasses multiple dimensions is necessary for fostering overall development and driving a country toward prosperity.
