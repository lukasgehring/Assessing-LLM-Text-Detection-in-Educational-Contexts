1095;A country becomes more interesting and develops more quickly when its population includes a mixture of nationalities.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is belived that countries are developing faster and become more inspiring when their populations consist of variety of people with different nationalities. In my opinion, it is very controversial question, but I believe that nations who are tolerant to others and friendly are able to succeed in constracting better world not only for themselves and their surroundings but also for future generations. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view about attractiveness and development of countries based on national diversity.On the one hand, people of different nationalities are hardly able to understand each other and can be impatient for people who have another nationalities, that can create difficulties in communication, making agreements, sovling of problems. For example, people with different backgrounds can strat arguing about better governmental constitutions and politics, religions, educational system, traditional and another types of medicine, and so on. It worths to mention that none of those people will be completely right, if they deside to show off their experience instead of accepting ideas of others and just giving advice. Moreover, some disputes can even lead to quarrels, but not to finding the better dessisions, that can influence on safety of people with different nationalities. So, for living peacefully and sharing some ideas of better developmental practice, people should first of all respect each other independantly of their nantionalities.On the other hand, people of various nationalities are able to create not only interesting and diverse community, but also share knowlege and experience in order to achieve the best results in countries' development. For achieving this, people should follow several basic rules, which are usually unwritten, but those mental and behavioral lows should be understood by everyone. Firstly, they should be tolerant to each other and accepting some differences. Secondly, they should be polite when they want to share their knowlege and experiences, not showing off. Thirdly, it would be wonderful if they are able to create international community where people can communicate and make friends. Last but not least, they should remember that their attitudes for each other influence on the world as a whole where they and their children live, so they should be responsible for their words and behavior.In conclusion, countries which managed to connect people of different nationalities and create a friendly surroundings, in my opinion, are able to develope faster and look like fascinating diverse community which consist of people of various backgrounds.;It is believed that countries progress more swiftly and become more inspiring when their populations are comprised of individuals from diverse nationalities. While I find this a debatable topic, I contend that nations that practice tolerance and foster friendliness towards others are better equipped to create a positive environment not only for themselves and their communities but also for future generations. In this essay, I will explore both perspectives regarding the appeal and development of countries shaped by national diversity.On one hand, individuals from different nationalities often struggle to understand one another, leading to impatience towards those from different backgrounds. Such misunderstandings can create barriers to effective communication, hinder collaborative efforts, and complicate problem-solving. For instance, people with varied backgrounds might engage in arguments about governance, political systems, religious beliefs, educational practices, and medical traditions. It is important to recognize that no one perspective is entirely correct when individuals prioritize showcasing their own experiences over embracing the ideas of others and offering constructive advice. Furthermore, disagreements can escalate into disputes rather than fostering productive solutions, jeopardizing the safety and harmony among individuals from diverse backgrounds. Thus, to live peacefully and share promising developmental ideas, it is essential that people respect one another, regardless of their nationalities.On the other hand, a mix of nationalities can lead to vibrant and multifaceted communities that promote the exchange of knowledge and experiences, ultimately driving national development forward. To realize this potential, individuals should adhere to a few fundamental, though often unwritten, principles. Firstly, embracing tolerance and accepting differences is crucial. Secondly, it is important to approach the sharing of knowledge with humility, avoiding a showy demeanor. Thirdly, fostering international communities where individuals can interact and build friendships would be highly beneficial. Lastly, it is vital that people recognize that their attitudes toward one another have a broader impact on society, influencing the world in which they and their children will live. Therefore, individuals must be accountable for their words and actions.In conclusion, I believe that countries which successfully bring together people of various nationalities and cultivate a friendly atmosphere have the potential to develop more rapidly and reflect the beauty of a diverse community enriched by varied backgrounds.
1374;Advertising affects what people think is important and has a negative effect on their lives (agree/disagree);Today people are surrounded by advertising. This affects what people think is important and has a negative impact on people’s lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?With the advent of the Internet, advertisements, originally displayed only on TV, billboards, posters and so on, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and commonplace for the general public. In my view, this kind of impact could be both crucial and, on a certain level, detrimental.On the one hand, this phenomenon could denote that although we have already had a diverse range of , people are still capable of inventing innovative approaches catering for all kinds of requirements of advertising. It is a symbol that demonstrates the creativity rooted in human beings. Apart from that, it also represents that the speed of spreading information is conspicuously escalating. More purposeful is, therefore, the fact that, besides booming of the advertising, it constitutes a major reason why people could be so prosperous in this digital age.On the other hand, there are various unpleasant consequences as well. Firstly, with the omnipresent , it could potentially cause people to do impulsive shopping. Secondly, the , if regulated in a mismanaged , could make people constantly feel uncomfortable or annoyed. In this sense, instead of being an instrumental tool to promote amenities, advertisements could be considered a hindrance when people are frequently blocked by them. Furthermore, it would cost one precious time to have to sift the helpful ad from a host of others.In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, advertising is a beneficial phenomenon for all with a number of insignificant drawbacks. I believe that in the future we can improve the way advertising is done at present, and embrace the positive influence of advertising even further in the long run.This essay is another example of what Band 8 writing may look like. It’s weak point is that the author goes slightly off-topic while trying to discuss whether advertising affects what people view as important and instead talks about the reason advertising is spreading and about human creativity. However, the other part of task type (negative effects of advertising) is covered well, the ideas are well-developed and supported. There is a clear logical flow of information and a range of transitional words is used appropriately to sequence ideas. The way author uses synonyms to rephrase the task topic in the intro paragraph demonstrates their lexical skill, which is also evident in other parts of this essay. There are many complex sentences and very few errors. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.0.;In today's world, advertising is an omnipresent force. This saturation influences what individuals prioritize and can have adverse effects on their lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree? With the rise of the Internet, traditional advertisements—once confined to mediums like television, billboards, and printed materials—are now everywhere, becoming a common sight for the general public. In my opinion, this widespread presence can be both significant and, to some degree, harmful.On one hand, this trend indicates that while we already encounter a diverse array of advertisements, there remains an ability to devise creative strategies that address various advertising needs. It reflects the inherent creativity found in humanity. Additionally, this surge in advertising signifies a remarkable acceleration in the dissemination of information. Importantly, beyond just the proliferation of ads, it plays a substantial role in why people can thrive in today's digital landscape.Conversely, there are several negative repercussions as well. Firstly, the constant presence of advertisements may lead individuals to engage in impulsive buying. Secondly, if poorly regulated, advertising can create a sense of discomfort or annoyance among consumers. In this regard, rather than serving as a useful tool for promoting products, ads can become an obstacle when people are constantly interrupted by them. Additionally, individuals may waste valuable time trying to discern useful ads amidst the overwhelming volume.In conclusion, I believe that advertising is largely a beneficial phenomenon, despite its minor drawbacks. I am optimistic that we can enhance current advertising practices in the future, further harnessing the positive effects of advertisements in the long term. This essay exemplifies Band 8 writing, though it slightly deviates from the main topic by discussing the reasons behind the rise of advertising and human creativity rather than solely focusing on its impact on values. However, it effectively covers the negative aspects of advertising, with well-developed and supported ideas. The essay maintains a clear logical progression, utilizing a range of transitional phrases to organize thoughts effectively. The author's adept use of synonyms in the introduction reflects their lexical proficiency, which is evident throughout the essay. It features numerous complex sentences and minimal errors, making it deserving of an IELTS Band 8.0 rating.
1395;Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone’s life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is a negative one. Discuss both views and include your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. You should write at least 250 words.;Many people wonder about . Some people think that it has negative impact in our life. However, positive effect on this world.? Of Course for several reasons: firstly, it motivates the psychological point in everyone, and women in particular. They will run to buy this advertised product especially if it’s from , just to show their beauty to men, which may lead to negative effects of too much sexual attention. Secondly, you can sit comfortably with your family and suddenly the telephone is ringing, but it’s nothing important, it’s just another company to convince you to buy one of their products. It is a real . Lastly, sometimes you do not have the financial ability to buy something, but with these new methods of advertisement, you run to buy it, which affect your budget.On the other hand, there are some good sides to advertising. For instance, it compares the prices of many companies which the consumer. Besides, it really see more products which we unless the TV or Radio advertised them. , it breaks our daily routine and allows us to see new faces and learn the language better with the help of the daily updates they deliver through .In conclusion, as we can see there are many aspects to this . I feel that we gain no benefits at all from advertisement, it plays buy more things that they do not need it at all.;Many people have mixed feelings about advertising. While some believe it has a negative impact on our lives, others argue that it can have positive effects on the world. The reasons for this viewpoint are numerous. Firstly, advertising can have a powerful psychological influence, particularly on women, who may feel compelled to purchase marketed products to enhance their beauty in the eyes of men. This can lead to an unhealthy amount of sexual attention. Secondly, when you're comfortably sitting at home with family and the phone rings, it’s often just another sales call trying to persuade you to buy something unnecessary—a true annoyance. Lastly, even if you may not have the financial means to buy something, new advertising methods can create an urge to purchase, putting a strain on your budget.On the flip side, there are certain advantages to advertising. For example, it allows consumers to compare prices across different companies. Additionally, commercials can introduce us to products we might not have discovered otherwise, as they highlight offerings we wouldn't see without advertising on platforms like TV and radio. Advertising also adds variety to our daily routines by presenting new ideas and languages through their constant updates.In conclusion, advertising has its pros and cons. Personally, I believe that it often leads people to purchase unnecessary items, ultimately offering little benefit to our lives.
845;Boxing is a blood sport which often results in physical injury. It is inappropriate for this sport to exist in the modern age.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;There is debatable issue as to whether boxing, a seemingly bloody sport, should be excluded from the modern society. As far as I am concerned, the attempt to remove boxing from the current age is utterly unjustified.Admittedly, boxing is often associated with various disturbing factors, such as foul language, disregard to rivals, violent punches and inelegant appearance as a result of intense physical contacts. However, such gory scenes may frequently take place in underground boxing games which are barely recognised by the professional community of boxing and by the legal system. Unlike underground boxing, professional boxing upholds moral principles and universal values, for examples, respect to opponents, obedience of rules, etc. Also, professional boxers are protected by safety equipment and judges who may stop the game when witnessing any player suffering serious injuries. Therefore, the health hazards involved in boxing games may not be as severe as the public assumes.Another reason reinforcing my position is that boxing already enjoys considerable popularity around the world and plays an important part in people's entertainment, as exemplified by the successful ticket sales of most boxing games and high audience rating of TV programmes broadcasting boxing matches. Given such popularity of boxing, the removal of this sport may cause widespread dissatisfaction and complaint.To draw a conclusion, the exclusion of boxing is completely groundless and irrational, given the safety protection, sportmanship and popularity as reflected in this sport. I expect in the future, more views could arise to furnish the understanding in this regard.;The question of whether boxing, a sport often perceived as brutal, should be excluded from modern society is a contentious one. In my view, the push to eliminate boxing is entirely unwarranted.It is true that boxing can be linked with disturbing elements, such as foul language, disrespect among competitors, aggressive punches, and a rough appearance resulting from the sport's physical nature. However, these violent scenes are typically associated with underground boxing events that lack acknowledgment from the professional boxing community and the legal system. In contrast, professional boxing adheres to ethical standards and core values, such as respect for opponents and adherence to rules. Furthermore, professional boxers are equipped with safety gear and overseen by referees who can halt a match if a competitor sustains serious injuries. Therefore, the health risks associated with boxing may not be as severe as the public often believes.Another point in support of my stance is that boxing enjoys significant global popularity and is a key form of entertainment for many, as evidenced by the successful ticket sales for boxing events and high viewership ratings for televised matches. Removing boxing could lead to widespread dissatisfaction among its fans.In conclusion, excluding boxing lacks sound reasoning and is irrational considering the safety measures in place, the spirit of sportsmanship, and the sport's popularity. I hope that in the future, more perspectives will emerge to enhance our understanding of this issue.
1429;Boys are most influenced by their fathers and girls are most influenced by their mothers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons to support your opinion.;It is true that nowadays have a great influence children. Some people hold the opinion that the same sex is the major determination of influencing parent, but others . As far as I am concerned, . My arguments for this point are listed below.First of all, a father is the person who have already passed ways his son is passing now, in other words, sons are following their father’s footsteps. , based on experience it is easy for a father to notice his sons’ drawbacks and to influence them.Secondly, it is true that a boy is , a girl is a subtle and fragile one. It is hard for mothers to influence their sons, because it is not likely that can affect a strong one.In conclusion, it seems to me unfair that boys are most influenced by their mothers. Based on at least two points above I strongly agree that children are influenced by a parent of the same gender.;It is true that children today are greatly influenced by their parents. Some people argue that the same sex is the primary factor in this influence, while others disagree. In my view, I believe that the gender of the parent plays a significant role. Here are my reasons for this perspective.Firstly, a father has experienced the same challenges that his son is currently facing. In other words, sons often follow in their father's footsteps. With this shared experience, fathers are more attuned to their sons' weaknesses and can guide them effectively.Secondly, boys and girls perceive the world differently. Boys tend to be more resilient, while girls may be more sensitive and delicate. As a result, it can be difficult for mothers to influence their sons, as they might struggle to connect with their strong-willed nature.In conclusion, I find it unfair to claim that boys are primarily influenced by their mothers. Based on the points I've mentioned, I strongly believe that children are more influenced by a parent of the same gender.
1364;Changing drivers age limits is the best way to reduce traffic accidents (from Target Band ;This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskThe best way to reduce traffic accidents is to raise the age limit for younger drivers and to lower the age limit for elderly ones. Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsIn today’s world the number of traffic accidents is constantly rising as well as the number of injuries and deaths they cause. A better regulative approach is required traffic accidents can be reduced. Some people say that changing the drivers’ age limits is the best solution to the problem. However, there are other, more practical ways to deal with this problem.One alternative is imposing heavier fines the drivers who exceed the permitted alcohol consumption. According to recent , a great proportion of traffic accidents has alcohol as its reason. Utilising technology and installing devices that detect drunk drivers and lock car ignition can be used to keep people with track record of drunk driving off the roads. On some occasions and for repeat offenders in particular, a prison sentence may also be considered.Furthermore, people should be better educated and more careful while behind the wheel. To be more specific, people should learn to obey road rules and respect the other drivers instead of causing tension or submitting to road rage. In addition, heavy fines should also be levied for exceeded speed limits. Last but not least, safer and wider roads should be constructed to make for easier and more comfortable driving.Tightening age limits for drivers can be a complementary approach. For example, the elderly with vision problems or other important health issues should be excluded from driving. Besides, young people under 18 years old are considered immature to drive. However, maturity does not necessarily always increases with one’s age, which is why other measures are needed dangerous driving.In conclusion, I believe that stronger measures should be implemented for the prevention of traffic accidents, and drivers should have a more responsible attitude. Setting age limits could be helpful but should not be considered the optimal and only solution to the problem.The writer’s position is clear throughout the essay. There is a logical organisation of information and effective use of paragraphing. The range of vocabulary is wide enough for the student to show flexibility and accuracy of expression. Overall, the control of grammar and punctuation is good, with only a few errors made. The essay is up to the mark and is likely to get Band 8 in IELTS.;"This essay addresses a topic from the book ""Target Band 7"" (page 54, reprinted with permission). You should allocate approximately 40 minutes to complete this task. The assertion is that the most effective way to decrease traffic accidents is to raise the age limit for young drivers while lowering it for older drivers. Do you agree or disagree? Provide justifications for your answer, including examples from your own experience. Write at least 250 words.Nowadays, the incidence of traffic accidents, along with the associated injuries and fatalities, continues to escalate. A more stringent regulatory approach is essential for reducing these accidents. Some individuals argue that adjusting the age limits for drivers is the most effective solution. However, alternative strategies may prove to be more practical in addressing this issue.One such strategy is to enforce harsher penalties on drivers who exceed legal alcohol consumption limits. Recent statistics indicate that a significant percentage of traffic accidents are alcohol-related. Additionally, leveraging technology by installing devices that can detect intoxicated drivers and disable vehicle ignition can help keep habitual offenders off the roads. In some cases, particularly for repeat violators, imprisonment may also be warranted.Moreover, enhancing driver education is crucial. Individuals should be trained to adhere to traffic regulations and show respect for other road users, rather than succumbing to road rage or creating unnecessary conflict. Imposing severe fines for speeding is also essential. Lastly, the construction of safer and wider roads can facilitate more comfortable and secure driving experiences.While tightening age restrictions for drivers may be a supplementary measure—such as preventing elderly individuals with significant health issues or young drivers under 18 from operating vehicles—it is important to recognize that maturity is not always contingent upon age. Therefore, additional measures are necessary to tackle dangerous driving.In conclusion, I advocate for stronger preventative measures to mitigate traffic accidents and urge drivers to adopt a more responsible mindset. While establishing age limits may be beneficial, it should not be viewed as the sole or most effective solution to this complex issue.The writer’s perspective is consistently clear throughout the essay, with logical organization and effective use of paragraphs. The vocabulary range demonstrates sufficient flexibility and precision. Overall, the control of grammar and punctuation is solid, with minimal errors observed. This essay meets the criteria for a Band 8 in the IELTS exam."
1366;Childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents (agree/disagree);"Childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion and include relevant examples.It is true that parents need some knowledge and experience in order to raise their in an appropriate way. In this regard, many families attend different training courses. While I agree that these courses might be useful for some of them, I totally disagree with the recommended obligatory of such training.On the one hand, training courses usually offered by governments could be very useful for those guardians who have a with special needs. For example, if a child has a birth defect or has been diagnosed with any mental or musculoskeletal disorders, these kinds of training could be lifesaving. Additionally, as we know, the first few months after birth are really a crucial period of a child’s life; parents should obtain different information related to their child’s vaccinations, common health problems, different developmental issues and so on, which can be delivered through such training courses.On the other hand, I believe that making these programs a mandatory option would cause several problems for societies and individuals as well. To begin with, in order to achieve this goal, many professionals should be trained which may not be affordable for some governments. From an individual’s point of view, this kind of programs could be very time-consuming for some families who have other at home or who work long hours. The other important consideration is that parent training courses may not provide all the necessary information for each and every family. To be more specific, parents could get more beneficial information through different websites such as YouTube according to their own preferences.In conclusion, although I believe that many families can take advantage training courses, I do believe that making them a compulsory option for everyone is too time and money-consuming for individuals and governments.The introduction is very good and relevant. The writer’s position is balanced, relevantly and properly developed in two body paragraphs. The conclusion summarizes both sides of the argument and logically finished the essay. To maintain the necessary level of formality the word ‘kids’ should be replaced with ‘children’ everywhere in this essay. The use of prepositions needs more attention as some are inappropriate or incorrect. The length could be reduced – it’s not necessary to write a very long essay to get a higher score, and often it is better to write a shorter essay (no shorter than 250 words though!) but spend more time proofreading, correcting errors and improving the quality of writing. Overall this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.";"Childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Share your opinion and provide relevant examples.It is undoubtedly important for parents to possess knowledge and skills to raise their children effectively. In this context, many families participate in various training programs. While I acknowledge that these courses can be beneficial for some parents, I firmly disagree with the idea that such training should be compulsory.On one hand, government-sponsored training programs can be incredibly valuable for caregivers of children with special needs. For instance, if a child is born with a congenital issue or has been diagnosed with mental or physical disorders, such specialized training could be essential. Moreover, the initial months following a child’s birth are critical for their development; parents can gain crucial insights about vaccinations, common health concerns, and developmental milestones through these training sessions.On the other hand, enforcing mandatory training programs could lead to several challenges for both society and individuals. Firstly, implementing this requirement would necessitate extensive training for many professionals, which may strain governmental resources. From an individual perspective, these programs can be quite time-consuming, especially for families with existing commitments or those who work long hours. Additionally, not every family will benefit from the same information provided in a standardized course. Parents may find more personalized and relevant guidance through various platforms, such as websites or online videos tailored to their individual needs.In conclusion, while I believe that many families can benefit from childcare training courses, I argue that making them compulsory would place an undue burden of time and resources on both individuals and governments. Overall, the introduction effectively sets the stage for the argument. The author's position is presented in a balanced manner, with relevant points developed in two clear body paragraphs. The conclusion effectively encapsulates the discussion while providing a logical resolution. To maintain a formal tone, it is advisable to replace the term ""kids"" with ""children"" throughout the essay. Attention to preposition usage is also necessary, as some applications may be incorrect or inappropriate. Additionally, the essay's length could be more concise; often, a shorter, well-edited essay can be more impactful. This essay has the potential to score a Band 8 in the IELTS exam."
1384;Children should be engaged in paid work, agree or disagree?;"In many countries children are engaged in different kinds of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?The issue of whether or not children should be engaged in some paid work has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that having some employment experience is conducive to a child’s learning and development, I contend that it would bring harm to the child’s and learning.First of all, a workplace designed for adults normally child-friendly facilities. Desks and chairs are too high for a child; the light switches are installed on the walls unreachable children; also emergency training and facilities such as phones are only provided to adults. Furthermore, various hazards such as polluted air and chemical fumes are still produced in factories and farms. Undoubtedly young people would suffer in such workplaces.Also, children would find it frustrating when they are not properly inducted before starting a job. A child working in a cement factory would feel a setback when he could not get immediate support while struggling with the procedures of recording different raw materials that required by the job. Further, without sufficient support, a child’s misunderstanding or inappropriately communicating with adults would only disappoint him and prevents him from active learning and interacting with other people.To conclude, a child’s paid employment experience would lead to a negative impact on their health and active learning. However, recognizing the importance of children’s learning and their awareness of responsibility, it is advisable to encourage them to be involved in some volunteering opportunities where they can meaningfully learn and interact with other people with sufficient care and support in place for such jobs.This is a good essay. There are only a few errors (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections), but otherwise this work seems worthy of Band 7.5 or 8. Remember to always proofread your essay before submitting it. Keep up the good work!";In numerous countries, children partake in various forms of paid labor. Some individuals view this practice as entirely unacceptable, while others see it as a beneficial opportunity for gaining work experience, essential for personal growth and responsibility. What is your perspective on this matter? The question of whether children should engage in paid work has ignited a passionate debate. While some believe that such employment can aid a child’s development and education, I argue that it can ultimately be detrimental to their health and learning.Firstly, workplaces designed for adults often lack child-friendly features. Desks and chairs are typically too tall for children, light switches are mounted out of their reach, and emergency equipment and training are primarily aimed at adult employees. Additionally, hazards such as pollution and chemical exposure are prevalent in many factories and farms, posing significant risks to young workers.Moreover, children may feel overwhelmed when they are not adequately trained before starting a job. For instance, a child employed at a cement factory could become frustrated when unable to seek immediate assistance while trying to navigate the process of tracking various raw materials required for the position. Without proper guidance, a child may struggle to communicate effectively with adults, leading to confusion and disappointment, which detracts from their opportunities for active learning and social interaction.In conclusion, engaging in paid work can have adverse effects on a child’s health and educational experience. While it is important to foster a sense of responsibility in children, encouraging them to participate in volunteer opportunities would be more beneficial. Such experiences allow for meaningful engagement and learning while ensuring they receive adequate support and care. This essay is well-structured and demonstrates thoughtful arguments, with only a few minor errors. Overall, it merits a score between Band 7.5 and 8. Always remember to proofread your work before submission. Keep up the excellent effort!
1383;Children these days are suffering from obesity, why and how can it be solved?;Modern children are suffering from the diseases that were once considered to be meant for adults only. Obesity is a major disease prevalent among children. What are its causes and what solutions can be offered?Nowadays, the increasing rate of overweight children and adults is a worldwide health issue. Obesity is a major problem which is increasing day by day in children. There are various reasons behind it. This essay will discuss the causes of obesity and offer some solutions.The first cause of obesity is junk food. It is often seen that mostly children are fond of burgers, pizzas, noodles and . These types of foods are easily available to them in school canteens. Children love to purchase chips, , ice-cream for lunch. Moreover, in this modern era, parents are working and they do not have time to cook at home. Parents often buy dinner for their children instead of preparing food at home. This calorie-rich diet is making children obese. This problem can be solved by teaching children to cook healthy foods for themselves and banning junk foods and fizzy drinks in schools. This diet can be replaced by milk, juice and fruits for lunch.The second cause of obesity is . It is true that the use of computers and television is increasing children. They spend most of their time watching television or playing video games on a computer. This technological advancement has reduced the level of physical activity in this specific age group. This issue can be resolved by encouraging children to do physical exercises. Parents can take their children to park to encourage playing with friends. Furthermore, schools can add sports in their curriculum to maintain physical fitness in their students.To sum up, it is clear that main causes of obesity are unhealthy eating and not enough physical activities. This ailment can be prevented and treated by healthy eating and physical exercises.This is a good essay. There are only a few minor errors that could have been easily prevented by proofreading this essay one last time before submission (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). Overall, this work seems worthy of IELTS Band 8. Keep up the good work!;Contemporary children are increasingly facing health issues that were once thought to affect only adults. One of the most significant concerns is obesity, which is becoming more prevalent among children. This essay will explore the underlying causes of this condition and propose potential solutions.The rising rates of overweight individuals, both children and adults, present a global health crisis. Among the various contributors to this problem, junk food consumption stands out. Many children have a penchant for fast foods such as burgers, pizzas, and noodles, which are readily available in school cafeterias. Additionally, children often enjoy snacks like chips and ice cream during lunch. Furthermore, in today's fast-paced world, many parents are busy with work and lack the time to prepare home-cooked meals. As a result, they frequently opt for takeout, leading to a diet high in calories that contributes to obesity among children. To combat this issue, it is essential to educate children about healthy cooking practices and restrict the availability of junk food and sugary drinks in schools. Replacing these unhealthy options with nutritious alternatives like milk, juice, and fruits during meals can significantly improve their diets.Another significant factor contributing to obesity is the growing screen time among children. Increasingly, they spend excessive hours watching television or playing video games on computers, leading to a sedentary lifestyle.

Parents can take their children to parks to encourage outdoor play with their peers. Additionally, schools can integrate sports programs into their curricula to help students stay physically active.In conclusion, the primary causes of obesity in children are poor dietary choices and insufficient physical activity. However, this condition can be effectively prevented and managed through healthier eating habits and regular exercise. Overall, this essay is well-structured and insightful. While there are a few minor errors that could have been corrected with another round of proofreading, the work is still deserving of an IELTS Band 8 rating. Keep up the excellent work!
857;Competitiveness is a positive quality for people in most societies. How does competitiveness affect individuals? Is it a positive or negative trend?;Life is full of competition. Soon after the release from competitive university exams, the hard fighting for higher positions in a company will be waiting for you. While the competitiveness has been bringing us a convenient society, no small number of employments have been tired of never-ending competitions. No doubt about a positive effect on societies, but when we start to argue about the effect on individuals, it becomes more controversial. This essay will argue the drawbacks of competitiveness for individuals, especially from the perspective of Japanese modern society and typical Japanese office workers. I believe that cooperativeness and uniqueness are sometimes more important attitude than competitiveness.Firstly, competitiveness causes less diversity. If there is a competition, there must be the same evaluation metrics to differentiate winners and losers. The evaluation procedure needs to limit the metrics into specific aspects of the human being. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to prove that the metrics are proper for all of the possible cases and effective for the HR evaluation. For example, Japanese companies are likely to judge quantitatively based on the numbers related to performance. However, how can we evaluate the cooperativity or the non-quantitative performance like in creative jobs? Most Japanese companies adopted the HR evaluation methods based on average working hours per day and number of reports monthly. That’s why the Japanese tend to overwork to fulfill this requirement. In addition, as a result of placing more importance in quantity of reports, rather than quality, Japanese employees are prone to choose easy and short-term tasks or outsourcing instead of building by their own methods. This tendency causes fewer complicated and long-term tasks.Secondly, competitiveness causes less cooperativeness. Fewer people volunteer to play a disadvantageous role for smooth teamwork. Moreover, some people play an evil role by blaming or cheating the competitors in order to be superior to them. As a consequence, overall efficiency will decline and some people will be overestimated. Even if there are no problems temporarily, the long-lasting large companies will eventually become corrupt, and those who have the most political power, rather than real power, will remain at the top.Consequently, competitiveness is the basis of capitalism which brings us a brighter and more convenient society, however, biased evaluation and less cooperative working environment possibly drive people into nervous breakdowns. Karoshi, overwork death derived from too much stress and less sleeping, is one of the most serious social problems in Japan. We may need to rethink about the competitiveness.;Life is rife with competition. Following the intense battles of university entrance exams, individuals soon find themselves vying for top positions in the corporate world. While competitiveness has contributed to a more convenient society, many employees are exhausted by the relentless nature of these contests. Despite its positive impacts on society, the effects of competitiveness on individuals are more contentious. This essay will explore the drawbacks of competitiveness for individuals, particularly within the context of modern Japanese society and the experiences of typical Japanese office workers. I argue that traits like cooperativeness and individuality can often hold more value than competitiveness.First and foremost, competitiveness often leads to a lack of diversity. Competition inherently requires uniform evaluation criteria to distinguish between winners and losers. Such criteria tend to focus on narrow aspects of individual performance, making it challenging to determine their adequacy across various situations. For instance, many Japanese companies often rely on quantitative assessments of metrics tied to performance. However, how can we fairly evaluate qualities like cooperation or the non-quantifiable contributions found in creative roles? Predominantly, Japanese firms use HR evaluation methods based on daily working hours and the number of reports submitted each month. Consequently, many employees in Japan find themselves overworking to meet these standards. This emphasis on the quantity of reports over quality pushes employees to gravitate toward easier, short-term tasks or even outsourcing, instead of developing their unique methods for problem-solving. As a result, there’s a decline in complex, long-term projects.Additionally, competitiveness diminishes cooperativeness. Fewer individuals are willing to assume less advantageous roles that facilitate effective teamwork. Furthermore, some may resort to underhanded tactics, like blaming or sabotaging their colleagues, in their quest for superiority. This behavior ultimately leads to reduced overall efficiency, placing undue focus on superficial accomplishments rather than genuine contributions. Even in the absence of immediate issues, long-established companies can become plagued by corruption, where individuals with political influence—not actual merit—climb to the top.In summary, although competitiveness is a foundational element of capitalism that fosters a brighter, more efficient society, the resultant skewed evaluations and diminished collaborative environments can contribute to significant stress among individuals. The phenomenon of karoshi—death from overwork due to excessive stress and lack of sleep—is a stark reminder of the serious social challenges faced in Japan. It may be time to reconsider the value placed on competitiveness.
425;Computers are now the basis of the modern world. They should therefore be introduced into classrooms, and their programs used for direct teaching purposes. However, dependence on computers in teaching may carry a certain degree of risk to students.Discuss both sides and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Computers are presntly an integral part of the civilized world and are essential to daily living. Some individuals believe that they should be introduced into the classroom and used for teaching purposes while others are of the opinion that dependence on computers in teaching may pose a risk to students.Introducing computers and their programs in educational instuitions for learning purposes is a beneficial thing to students. The world is fast changing and students need to meet up and be at par with others in the world. The globe is becoming a more digital place and computers are the core of that, teaching using computers will open students' minds to new possibilitiies, faster approaches and more advanced ways of solving problems. A recent study showed that 75% of students who were taught using computers are currently more successful than others in their work places.It is understandable that people also think that dependence on computers in teaching may be detrimental to students. The students may become lazy and may not necessarily want to use their brains to calculate or understand things because the computer has already done that for them. Also using computers to learn in the school environment is also just adding to screen time for the learners; they are already being exposed to lots of wrong things at home adding school to it may not neceesarily the best option.Personally, students have a lot to learn using computers but truthfully speaking most of them already have the technological know how when it comes to using computers and if they actually want to learn more about how to use them, they can do so at home using the popular learning sites, it doesnt necessarily have to be introduced into the school learning system.In conclusion,computers are currently the foundation of the modern world and have their advantages and disadvantages, if they are put to the right use at the appropriate place and time, its benefits are beyond measure.";"Computers have become an essential component of modern society, playing a critical role in our everyday lives. While some advocate for their integration into classrooms for educational purposes, others caution that reliance on computers may hinder students' learning.Incorporating computers and their software into educational settings can significantly benefit students. As the world rapidly evolves, it is crucial for students to keep pace with global advancements. A digital landscape is emerging, and computers are at its forefront; leveraging technology in education can expose students to new possibilities, expedite learning, and provide innovative methods for problem-solving. Recent research indicates that 75% of students educated with computers have achieved greater success in their professional endeavors compared to their peers.Conversely, there are valid concerns regarding the potential downsides of heavy reliance on computers in education. Critics argue that reliance on technology may lead students to become complacent, as they may not engage their critical thinking or problem-solving skills when computers perform these tasks for them. Additionally, increased screen time in school could compound exposure to negative influences already prevalent in their home environments, making it a less-than-ideal situation.From a personal perspective, while computers offer substantial learning opportunities, many students are already familiar with technology and can enhance their skills through popular online learning platforms at home, without necessarily requiring their introduction into formal education.In summary, computers form the backbone of contemporary society, providing both benefits and drawbacks. When utilized appropriately and in the right context, their advantages can be invaluable."
1329;Crime rates are likely to decline due to the advancements in technology, which will help prevent and solve crimes in an easier way. Do you agree or disagree?;"Nowadays technology is advancing faster than ever and many fields are benefitting from the opportunities this trend presents. Some think that crime prevention can be one possible application of new technologies, by allowing to deter offenders or solve crimes in a faster and easier way. In my opinion, innovation in crime prevention can be a game-changer that will reduce both the number of crimes committed and the time it takes to catch those responsible for them.Not everyone is optimistic about the prospects of the use of new technologies in crime prevention, and those who subscribe to the more pessimistic view say that advanced technologies can be accessed by criminals, therefore raising the crime rates. Such tools can, indeed, cause more damage if they fall in the wrong hands; however, it would require the offenders to be highly skilled to be able to use the modern technologies. Statistically, many of them tend to have a lower level of education, and for that reason they are likely to stick to the old ways of committing crimes, whereas the minority of highly skilled criminals are unlikely to make a big difference to the crime levels.Law enforcement workforce, on the other hand, has a much better grip on modern technology. Nowadays police officers and detectives undergo special training, take regular skill update courses, and use high-tech equipment. Facial recognition and thermal imaging are just two examples of the important tools that police are already using to find and catch offenders faster. Ordinary citizens can do their part in preventing burglaries by installing sophisticated systems with sensors, CCTV video feed and various alarms to detect and deter thieves. The combined effort will, no doubt, push the crime curve down.To sum up, even though the wonders of technology are available to everyone, it seems to me that they will better assist law enforcement in solving crimes, and law-abiding citizens in protecting themselves and their property, rather than felons. This will tip the balance in favour of reduction in crime rate and make the world a safer place.";In today's rapidly advancing technological landscape, many sectors are reaping the benefits of these developments. One potential application of new technologies is in crime prevention, where they can help deter offenders and facilitate quicker resolution of criminal cases. I believe that innovations in this area could significantly decrease both the incidence of crimes and the duration needed to apprehend those responsible.However, not everyone shares this optimistic perspective regarding the role of new technologies in combating crime. Some skeptics argue that criminals can exploit these advanced tools, potentially leading to an increase in crime rates. While it is true that such tools could be misused if they fall into the wrong hands, it demands a level of skill that most offenders may not possess. Typically, many criminals have lower educational backgrounds and are likely to rely on traditional methods to commit their acts, while the minority who are more technologically adept are not sufficient to substantially impact overall crime rates.In contrast, law enforcement personnel are increasingly proficient with modern technology. Today’s police officers and detectives receive specialized training, participate in regular skill enhancement courses, and utilize advanced equipment. Tools such as facial recognition and thermal imaging are already in use, enabling law enforcement to locate and apprehend offenders more efficiently. Additionally, citizens can contribute to crime prevention efforts by installing sophisticated security systems equipped with sensors, CCTV cameras, and alarms to deter potential burglars. This collective initiative is bound to lower crime rates.In conclusion, despite the widespread availability of technological advancements, it appears that these innovations will more effectively aid law enforcement in solving crimes and helping law-abiding citizens protect themselves and their property, rather than benefiting criminals. This shift will ultimately contribute to a reduction in crime rates, creating a safer environment for everyone.

1417;Dieting can change a person’s life for the better or ruins one’s health completely. What is your opinion?;Almost of the women today want a beautiful figure. That is why we are able to find a diet programme almost everywhere in the country. Most of the women have and gone on a diet before either to or just health problem.A proper diet programme will help you not only to slim down but also to have a eating habits. For instance more vegetables and fruits meat, fried food and carbonated drinks. For a diet programme we shouldn’t food and water. There are some diet programmes from the doctors that help you to have a heart like the “Three day diet” which we can find on the Internet. This programme allows you to eat fruits and also some meat. This way of dieting will help you to avoid some of the health problems in the future like or a heart attack.However some people do not only go on a diet but they avoid eating and hungry for the whole day. All they have is just either water or juices. Also there people who buy special diet programmes over the counter which are not approved by the health department and they are doing so without consulting a doctor first. They do not follow the basic rules of dieting and this will lead them to some serious health problems like of some body parts or, even worse, death.In my opinion there is wrong with going on a diet as long as we follow the correct way of eating and .;"Many women today aspire to have an attractive figure, which is why diet programs are widely available across the country. A significant number of women have tried dieting before, whether for weight loss or health reasons. A well-structured diet program can not only help you slim down but also encourage healthier eating habits, such as incorporating more fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins, while reducing fried foods and sugary drinks.It is important to remember that a successful diet should not involve extreme restrictions on food or water intake. There are medically-recommended diet programs, like the ""Three-Day Diet,"" which can be found online. This plan allows for the inclusion of fruits and some meats, helping to reduce the risk of future health issues such as heart disease.However, some individuals take dieting to extremes—foregoing meals entirely and surviving only on water or juice. Additionally, there are those who purchase diet programs over the counter without proper approval or medical consultation. Ignoring fundamental dieting principles can lead to serious health consequences, including organ damage or even death.In my view, dieting is perfectly acceptable as long as it is done in a safe and healthy manner, focusing on balanced nutrition."
1409;Dieting can change a person’s life for the better or ruins one’s health completely. What’s your opinion?;Dieting seems to be of our life in this modern society, especially for those who are health conscious. Different people choose different type of dieting methods, trying to achieve what they believe to be good for either their health or physical appearance. In general, most of the people who diet are focusing on controlling their weight.In our urban society, most of the working class not have the opportunity to consume . Their daily meals consist of fast food which contains large amounts of fat and salt. The most significant of this unhealthy lifestyle is the weight gain especially among those middle age working professionals.Therefore, most of these young and energetic people have to control their diet in order to stay in shape either for their appearance or health. The most common and proper method of maintaining one’s weight is eating less oily food, preferably more green vegetables, fruits and alcohol.However, some have resorted to losing weight by taking their diet to the extreme, not eating at all for days. Others will make themselves vomit after each meal. Many others will go for dieting medication and beverages that help them to lose their appetite. These unhealthy will cause internal damage in the long run.In my opinion, dieting for better health is more important than solely for looking attractive. Individuals who wish to control their weight should seek professional if they are unable to reduce their weight after switching over to a healthy diet for a period of time. Losing weight and losing your health at the same time does not benefit any individual.This essay needs some work. The first body paragraph explains the reason people have for dieting, whereas it should explain what are the advantages or the dangers of it. The second body paragraph explains how to diet, whereas it should present arguments for or against dieting. Therefore, the task is only partially covered here.;In today's modern society, dieting has become an integral part of many people's lives, particularly for those who prioritize their health. Individuals adopt various dieting methods in pursuit of what they believe will enhance their health or physical appearance. Generally, most dieters aim to manage their weight. In urban environments, many members of the working class find it challenging to maintain a balanced diet due to their fast-paced lifestyles. Their meals often consist of fast food, which is high in fat and salt. This unhealthy eating pattern has led to a noticeable increase in weight gain, particularly among middle-aged professionals. As a result, many young and active individuals feel compelled to regulate their diets for both health reasons and aesthetic concerns. The most common and effective approach to weight management involves reducing the intake of oily foods while increasing the consumption of green vegetables, fruits, and minimizing alcohol.However, some individuals take extreme measures in their quest for weight loss, sometimes resorting to fasting for days or inducing vomiting after meals. Others may rely on diet pills and appetite-suppressing beverages, which can lead to serious internal damage over time. In my view, prioritizing health through dieting is far more important than simply aiming for an attractive appearance. Those struggling to lose weight despite adopting a healthy diet should consider seeking professional guidance. Achieving weight loss at the expense of one’s health is a dangerous path that offers no real benefits.The essay as it stands requires further development. The first body paragraph addresses the reasons behind dieting but should highlight its advantages and potential dangers instead. The second body paragraph discusses methods of dieting, yet it should focus on presenting arguments for or against the practice. Thus, the current task is only partially fulfilled.
1323;Discipline is a growing problem in modern schools. Some people think that parents should discipline their own children, while others think it should be the responsibility of the government. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;While some people argue that parents should take sole responsibility for disciplining their children, others take the view that the government should be in charge of such matters. In my opinion, the young generation should be primarily guided by their parents where rules of behavior and moral principles are concerned. However, in some instances government intervention is necessary.On one side of the argument, there are people who hold the opinion that the responsibility of disciplining a child falls squarely on parents’ shoulders, since they are their first educators, and it is their duty to equip their children with good manners and morals even before their first day at school. In addition, every family has a unique understanding of what a suitable form of discipline entails. Therefore, some parents are concerned that any form of punishment meted out at school might be too harsh. To overcome this issue, they believe that parents should be informed by the school of their child’s wrongdoing so that they could decide an appropriate consequence for their behavior at home.Unfortunately, not all parents are objective enough to make the right decisions when it comes to the upbringing of their children. Some may lack information or sound moral background to discipline their children in a meaningful way. Therefore, the state should shoulder some of the responsibility by implementing a strict set of guidelines and policies on how to discipline children at school. I believe that such policies result in children who flourish and are more likely to become productive citizens that actively contribute to a prosperous nation. Also, this would help both parents and teachers understand which punishments are suitable for minor infractions like missing an assignment or major incidents like bullying or skipping school.In conclusion, while both views are commonly held in society, I believe that the government must be actively involved in the policies related to discipline at schools as this would ensure the well-being and successful development of the youth.;Some individuals contend that the responsibility for disciplining children should rest solely with parents, while others argue that the government should manage this duty. In my view, parents should primarily guide the younger generation concerning behavior and moral values, although there are situations where government involvement is necessary.Proponents of parental responsibility argue that it is the parents who bear the primary duty of instilling good manners and morals, as they are the first educators their children encounter, even before school begins. Additionally, families often have distinct perspectives on what constitutes appropriate discipline, leading some parents to worry that school-imposed punishments could be excessively harsh. To address this concern, they believe that schools should inform parents of their children's misbehavior, allowing parents to determine suitable consequences at home.However, not all parents approach child-rearing with the necessary objectivity or knowledge to make effective disciplinary choices. Some may lack the insight or moral foundation required to discipline their children appropriately. As a result, the government should assume some responsibility by establishing clear guidelines and policies for disciplining children in schools. Such policies can foster the development of children who thrive and are more likely to become contributing members of society. Additionally, they can help both parents and teachers understand what types of punishment are appropriate for minor infractions, such as missing an assignment, versus more serious issues like bullying or truancy.In conclusion, while both perspectives have merit in society, I believe that active government involvement in school discipline policies is crucial for ensuring the well-being and successful development of our youth.
1066;Eating sweet foods produces acid in the mouth, which can cause tooth decay. (High acid levels are measured by low pH values)Describe the information below and discuss the implications for dental health.;The given graph shows the level of acidity in the mouth from consuming food that contains fruit or cane sugar and honey.To start with, if we take a look at honey-consistent food, we will notice that the acid level increases within the first 5 minutes. After that, the level of acidity remains at the rate of less than 5 pH, and, then goes down to a normal level. So, it is unlikely tooth decay to occur within such a short period of time.Regarding fruit and cane sugar-consistent food, it is quite noticeable that the acidity level increases dramatically at a level of less than 5.5 pH and 4.5 pH, respectively. However, the main difference between fruit and cane sugar is that the acid level of fruit sugar decreases within a bit more than 15 minutes. In contrast to it, the acid level of cane sugar goes down to a normal level within more than 25 minutes, which is more likely to get tooth decay.;The graph illustrates the acidity levels in the mouth resulting from the consumption of foods containing fruit, cane sugar, and honey. Initially, when examining honey-based foods, we observe a rise in acidity during the first five minutes. Following this peak, the acidity stabilizes at a level below 5 pH before gradually returning to normal. This suggests that the risk of tooth decay within such a brief time frame is minimal.In contrast, foods containing fruit and cane sugar show a significant spike in acidity, reaching levels below 5.5 pH and 4.5 pH, respectively. A notable distinction between fruit and cane sugar is that the acidity from fruit sugar decreases after slightly more than 15 minutes. On the other hand, the acidity from cane sugar takes over 25 minutes to return to normal levels, indicating a higher likelihood of contributing to tooth decay.
1362;Education in financial management should be a mandatory component of the school program, agree/disagree (from Target Band ;This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskEducation in financial management should be a mandatory component of the school program. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsMore and more young adults in our country are heavily indebted. Thus, it is considered by some that it should be mandatory to educate school children the administration of money. In my opinion, people should not leave school without a sound knowledge of financial management.To begin with, a country’s development is strongly upon the purchasing capacity of its inhabitants. That is to say, people who are in debt or financially vulnerable, would not be able to spend freely or invest, for example, in a new house, thus hindering the economic growth of the country. As a consequence, the rate of inflation would rise and people would be able to afford even less, which could ultimately result in the collapse of the entire economy. A good example of this vicious circle can be seen in countries such as Argentina, where people have to buy household items in the black market, because they cannot afford to buy them in regular stores due to skyrocketing prices. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to teach children early money management.Another point to consider is the low standard of living that people have when they mismanage their finances. Individuals who are constantly short of money could eventually end up being socially isolated and unhappy, because they couldn’t afford to participate in leisure activities, such as going to the cinema with a friend, resulting in their from social life. However, this could be avoided with ease by offering courses in money management.In conclusion, I strongly believe that school children should be taught how to manage their finances to prevent social isolation later in their life as well as to maintain the economic force of their country.The writer’s position is clear throughout the essay. Paragraphing is used effectively to organise ideas and information, however the paragraphs could have been balanced better in terms of the amount of content. The advanced vocabulary the writer uses creates a good impression of mature and fluent writer. Overall, the control of grammar and punctuation is fine, and the number of errors is small. The essay could achieve Band 8 in IELTS.;This essay is based on a topic from the “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission). You should allocate approximately 40 minutes to this task. The statement argues that education in financial management should be a compulsory part of the school curriculum. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view? Provide reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience. Write a minimum of 250 words.An increasing number of young adults in our country are burdened with significant debt. As a result, some believe that it is essential to teach financial management to schoolchildren. I strongly contend that no student should graduate without a solid understanding of money management.First and foremost, the economic development of a nation heavily relies on the purchasing power of its citizens. Individuals who are financially struggling or in debt are less likely to invest in significant purchases, such as homes, which can stifle national economic growth. This, in turn, can lead to rising inflation, making goods and services even less affordable and potentially triggering an economic downturn. A prime example of this detrimental cycle can be observed in countries like Argentina, where citizens frequently turn to the black market for basic necessities because they cannot afford the exorbitant prices in regular stores. Hence, instilling money management skills in children is crucial.Additionally, poor financial management can lead to a lower quality of life. People who consistently find themselves short on funds may experience social isolation and unhappiness, as they cannot afford to engage in leisure activities like going to the movies with friends. This situation could be easily mitigated through the introduction of financial education programs in schools.In conclusion, I firmly believe that teaching schoolchildren about financial management is essential not only for their personal well-being but also to sustain the economic vitality of our nation. The writer's viewpoint is consistently clear throughout the essay. Although the paragraphs are well-organized to convey ideas effectively, there is room for improvement in balancing the content across them. The use of advanced vocabulary indicates maturity and fluency in writing. Overall, the grammar and punctuation are well-controlled, with only a few minor errors. This essay could potentially achieve a Band 8 in the IELTS assessment.
1421;Even though Globalization affects the world’s economics in a very positive way, its negative sides should not be forgotten. Discuss.;Everything has sides in the world, and so has the of globalization . The effects of globalization on the world economy are .We must acknowledge that the negative effects are from a different kind than the positive ones. the negative sides, like low in less developed countries are important to .If we take the Eurozone for example, the economic changes the process are huge. Many companies have transferred their factories into cheaper production to in the world . The results are rising unemployment rates in the “old industrial countries”.In regard to the other countries on the world market, such as China, this job transfer is a big opportunity. But no one can that the consequences for the less developed countries where economy flourished, based on availability of cheap employees are highly important: globalization based on this facts brings problems.Nevertheless, there are also . In general it is remarkable that there is a new tendency in “Thinking Global”. For instance, people are willing to more languages and get educated about cultures. Countries as undeveloped, such as India, are getting chances to be the in a certain field.All in all it can be said that the effects of globalization are enormous. The of economic processes has changed completely. It is important to think in bigger terms, not just about the country. The positive things that this globalization process have brought us for the negative sides. The should be a world in balance, but this has yet to come.;"Everything in the world has multiple dimensions, and globalization is no exception. Its impact on the global economy is significant and multifaceted. It is crucial to recognize that the negative consequences differ from the positive ones. The adverse effects, such as declining wages in less developed countries, warrant serious attention. Take the Eurozone as an example; the economic transformations occurring there are substantial. Numerous companies have relocated their factories to regions with lower production costs, resulting in increasing unemployment rates in traditional industrial nations. For countries like China that are part of the global market, this shift can present valuable opportunities. However, it is undeniable that the repercussions for the less developed countries that relied on a workforce of cheap labor are severe: globalization in this context creates significant challenges. On the flip side, there are also positive aspects to consider. Generally, there is a growing trend towards ""Thinking Global."" People are increasingly eager to learn foreign languages and become culturally educated. Developing nations, such as India, are finding new opportunities to excel in specific sectors.In summary, the effects of globalization are profound, and the nature of economic processes has been completely transformed. It is essential to adopt a broader perspective that transcends national boundaries. While globalization brings about numerous benefits, we must also address its downsides effectively. The goal should be a balanced global environment, but achieving that balance is still a work in progress."
1319;Even though experts believe that walking is a great way to improve one’s health, very few people walk nowadays. Why aren’t people walking? What can be done to encourage them to walk more?;The benefits of walking are numerous, and experts recommend it as a good way to keep healthy and fit. Despite this, the number of people who walk on a daily basis is on the decline. The reasons for this are manifold, but there are also several solutions that may help people walk more.Lack of time is the most common reason people cite for not engaging in any form of physical activity. These days most people have hectic schedules that involve juggling their work and home responsibilities. As a result, they are often too exhausted or pressed for time and therefore opt for faster and more comfortable forms of transport, such as cars, bikes or public transport. Another major reason for the reduced number of pedestrians on the roads is a lack of safety. Most full-time workers are not free to walk during the day, and will skip it in the evenings or early morning hours, if they do not feel safe enough to do so.Fortunately, there are quite a few solutions to this issue. One is making walkers safe, which means the government should ensure that there are enough sidewalks and streetlights available in every suburb, so that pedestrians can walk or jog safely whenever time allows. Another useful option is to create special walking tracks and parks in neighbourhoods where people can get some much-needed exercise in the evenings. The added benefit of promoting the healthy lifestyle and walking in the community makes this solution even more attractive.To conclude, the pressures of daily life and lack of safely while walking reduce the popularity of this healthy practice. Governments can reverse this trend by creating more green spaces for people to walk in and addressing their safety concerns.;"Walking offers numerous health benefits, making it a highly recommended activity for maintaining fitness. However, the number of individuals who walk daily is decreasing. Various factors contribute to this decline, but there are several strategies that could encourage more people to take up walking.A primary reason many people cite for their lack of physical activity is time constraints. Nowadays, many individuals lead busy lives that require managing both work and home responsibilities. Consequently, they often feel too exhausted or pressed for time, opting instead for quicker and more convenient modes of transportation like cars, bikes, or public transit. Additionally, safety concerns significantly impact walking habits. Many full-time workers find it difficult to walk during the day and may avoid it in the early mornings or evenings if they feel unsafe.Fortunately, there are several solutions to address this issue. One approach is to enhance pedestrian safety; governments should ensure ample sidewalks and streetlights in all neighborhoods, allowing people to walk or jog securely whenever they find the time. Another effective strategy is to develop designated walking paths and parks in communities, providing residents with the opportunity to exercise in the evenings. This not only promotes physical health but also fosters a culture of walking within the community.In conclusion, the demands of modern life and concerns about safety diminish the appeal of walking as a healthy activity. By investing in more green spaces and addressing safety issues, governments can help reverse this trend and encourage more people to embrace walking."
1410;Even though globalization affects the world’s economy in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. Discuss.;Everything has two sides and the globalization is not exception. Our first thoughts about this topic include the process of global “McDonaldisation” and, generally speaking, spreading across the whole Globe.Firstly, I would try to concentrate on the positive aspects of globalisation. As far as economy is concerned, like the Global Bank or IMF are always focused on developing the ‘Third World’ and helping poor people to combat their life obstacles (through loans and donations). Moreover, the world becomes an area of sharing thoughts (e.g. philosophical or economical doctrines), which become popular due to lack of barriers.However, disadvantages of globalization are also widely known. Some people insist that because of this process, the spirit of countries and nations rapidly disappears. The integrity, established years ago is on the verge of collapsing. Furthermore, there’s a strong lobby of communists who , that the globalization indicates an uncontrolled reign of capitalists and slave work of lower labour-class. We should never forget about the detrimental impact of global investments on the environment – the green house effect or soar rains are triggered by globalization.To sum up, globalization has both positive and negative influence on our everyday life. I can’t agree with the popular statement that we should try to avoid being affected by it. However, we must not forget about our surroundings and local communities. They have a great value which should last forever.;"Everything has its pros and cons, and globalization is no exception. When we think about this topic, we often consider the phenomenon of global ""McDonaldisation"" and its widespread influence across the world. To start, let's focus on the positive aspects of globalization. Economically speaking, institutions like the World Bank and the IMF work tirelessly to support developing countries, assisting vulnerable populations in overcoming their challenges through loans and aid. Additionally, globalization fosters a space for the exchange of ideas—be it philosophical or economic—that can flourish without significant barriers.On the flip side, the drawbacks of globalization are well-documented. Critics argue that this process threatens the distinct identities of nations and cultures, with long-established traditions facing erosion. The social fabric that has been woven over years seems to be fraying. There is also a strong perspective from some communist factions that globalization represents the unchecked dominance of capitalism, leading to exploitative labor practices for the working class. Moreover, we cannot overlook the harmful effects of global investments on the environment, contributing to issues like the greenhouse effect and acid rain.In conclusion, globalization carries both positive and negative implications for our daily lives. I disagree with the notion that we should strive to shield ourselves from its influence. However, it's essential to remain mindful of our local surroundings and communities, as they hold intrinsic value that we should seek to preserve."
1306;Every household should have a government-imposed limit on the amount of rubbish it can throw away. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"The amount of waste people produce can be quite shocking, with every person generating kilograms of rubbish in a single day, and all this can be difficult to manage. This has given some people the idea that there should be a limitation on the amount of rubbish produced per household; however, opinions are divided as to whether this would be the the most effective option.Having a limitation on the amount of waste produced sounds like a fine solution to a significant problem, with over two hundred and fifty million tons being generated in 2016 by the U.S. alone. Taxing households that break limits would push people to produce less waste and make them more mindful of what can be recycled or composted. However, forcing people to produce less waste might not be attainable.Households produce as much waste as they need to live their lifestyles. The waste people generate is only a result of the products they purchase, and will most likely wish to continue to purchase. Taxing people may be a cause of resentment, with many of them already struggling to pay their usual bills. In addition, if people produce more than they are allowed, this will encourage littering and dumping, so that they are not caught with more waste than entitled, and this in turn will damage the environment.Though controlling the amount of waste produced is important, there could be other ways of encouraging lesser output. In my opinion, governments should encourage composting and recycling, which will also reduce wasted material. People should also be more aware of what waste they produce and how it can be reduced. An education drive on these issues would perhaps be more likely to succeed in reducing rubbish than imposing limitations.";The volume of waste generated by individuals can be quite alarming, with each person producing several kilograms of trash daily, making it challenging to manage effectively. This has led some to propose imposing limits on the waste output per household, although opinions remain divided on whether this would be the most effective approach. While limiting waste production appears to be a reasonable solution to a pressing issue—especially considering that the U.S. alone generated over 250 million tons in 2016—implementing such rules might not be feasible. Taxing households that exceed waste limits could encourage people to be more conscious of their waste and increase recycling and composting efforts. However, it is important to recognize that households generate waste based on their lifestyle needs. The waste produced stems from the products they buy and are likely to continue purchasing.Moreover, imposing taxes might lead to resentment among those already facing financial difficulties. If households find themselves exceeding their allowance, there is a risk they may resort to littering or illegal dumping to avoid penalties, which could further harm the environment. While managing waste production is crucial, alternative strategies might more effectively encourage reduced waste output. I believe that governments should focus on promoting recycling and composting efforts, which would naturally help minimize waste. Additionally, raising awareness about waste generation and reduction techniques could be beneficial. An educational campaign on these topics may prove to be a more successful method for reducing waste than implementing strict limitations.
1406;Every year an increasing number of students choose to go to another country for their higher education. Do you think the benefits of this development outweigh the problems associated with it?;The past twenty years have seen a dramatic change the number of students who go abroad . In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of this trend.On the one hand, both students and their country can benefit from this trend. First, students can choose more suitable methods for themselves because there are more options. The and teaching methods are quite different . According to foreign experts, Secondly, people can improve their foreign language, they can contact with when they are in a foreign country, and they quickly master the foreign language. Thirdly, it helps to promote the mutual understanding between their mother land and their destination countries. These students exchange information with the locals. Students can get better understanding of the countries. People in their home country will get more vivid information about other countries . Similarly, the locals also can get more clear recognition about other countries.On the other hand, there are disadvantages too. Firstly, it costs people a lot of money to begin college in foreign countries. Many families have to take out all their savings to support their children abroad. Secondly, some students cannot stand the big difference the new environment, they quit their study and come back home.To conclude, given the fact that in foreign countries helps students with their studies and promotes the mutual understanding countries, even if there are some drawbacks, I think the benefits outweigh the problems.;Over the past two decades, the number of students studying abroad has significantly increased. In this essay, I will examine the advantages and disadvantages of this phenomenon. On one hand, this trend offers various benefits for both students and their home countries. Firstly, students have access to a wider array of educational options, allowing them to find methods and disciplines that suit them best, as teaching styles can vary greatly. According to international experts, this diversity enhances the learning experience. Secondly, studying in a foreign country provides students with immersive opportunities to improve their language skills, enabling them to quickly achieve fluency through constant practice with native speakers. Thirdly, this exchange fosters greater mutual understanding between their home nation and the host country, as students engage with locals and acquire firsthand insights about different cultures. This sharing of experiences enriches the understanding for both the students and the communities they interact with. On the other hand, there are notable drawbacks. Firstly, attending college abroad can be extremely costly, prompting many families to deplete their savings to support their students. Secondly, some students struggle to adapt to the significant differences in their new environment, leading some to withdraw from their studies and return home.In conclusion, while there are challenges associated with studying abroad, the positive impacts—such as enhanced educational opportunities and increased cultural understanding—ultimately outweigh the negatives.
1305;Everybody today should pay a small amount from their income in order to help people who are homeless and / or suffering great poverty. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Homelessness and poverty is a terrible but topical issue in both more economically advanced and less industrialised countries. To deal with this, many people feel that a small proportion of everyone’s income should be used to aid the homeless and poor. This could create more opportunities and change the lives of many disadvantaged people for the better.Though there are certain facilities such as shelters and soup kitchens to aid the poor and homeless, it is clear that this is not enough. In the U.S. alone, a very developed country in itself, nearly two million people are homeless. These facilities can lend a helpful hand; however, they do not help eradicate the problem. Those people who are homeless or poor can have trouble finding jobs, or, if they are lucky to gain employment, the pay may not be enough to support them and their families.If a small percentage of everyone’s income was used to help build more aid facilities and fund organisations to help the homeless and poor, the suffering of many people could be alleviated. However, this is not a perfect world, and taxes are high enough for many people. A similar argument could be that a portion of the taxes already paid to the government should then be set aside for this cause, but of course government funds are usually stretched to breaking point as it is, as governments have so many financial responsibilities already.Though the fundamental idea that people should pay a small percentage of their income to help the homeless and poor is admirable, it is unlikely that enough people would agree to it. People need all the money they earn after taxes anyway and, although governments already have too many calls on their available funds, in my view they should prioritise support payments for the homeless.";Homelessness and poverty represent significant and pressing challenges in both developed and developing nations. To address these issues, many believe that a small portion of everyone's income should be dedicated to assisting the homeless and those in poverty. This funding could provide new opportunities and improve the lives of numerous disadvantaged individuals. While there are existing resources like shelters and soup kitchens aimed at helping the homeless and impoverished, these services alone are insufficient. In the United States, a wealthy nation, nearly two million individuals experience homelessness. Although these facilities offer vital support, they do not resolve the underlying problem. Many homeless individuals struggle to secure employment, and even when they do find work, the wages may not be sufficient to sustain themselves and their families.If a small percentage of everyone’s income were allocated to develop additional aid facilities and support organizations for the homeless and impoverished, it could significantly ease the suffering of many. However, this is not a utopian scenario, and many people already face high tax burdens. An alternative perspective could argue that some of the taxes currently paid to the government should be earmarked for this purpose. Yet, government budgets are often stretched thin due to numerous financial obligations.Although the concept of individuals contributing a small percentage of their income to assist the homeless and low-income families is commendable, it seems unlikely that a sufficient number of people would agree to such a measure. Many individuals require all of their post-tax earnings to meet their own needs. While governments already have numerous demands on their finances, I believe that they should prioritize support for the homeless.
1407;Financial education should be a mandatory component of the school program. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;In many countries the discussion about financial education getting more serious due to financial problems of young generation. Some people that financial education should be considered a mandatory subject at school.The common problem for those young people is that they don’t know how to spend money in right way. As we can see many advertisements often carry out the message, “Only 10 dollars a week, no deposits” which is misleading think that living in debt is normal. Financial education is one of the solutions for . The basic idea of financial education as a core school subject is to teach those young ones to understand the concept of using money and to estimate a risk of borrowing money to buy something in the future.However, another factor we need . In my opinion, the role of financial education is getting more important and it should be a part of the school program but the parents are also important and have responsibility to how to manage the money. More than 70% of young people’s money is from their parents. In addition, it has to be considered that a student might become person, talking about money all the time in class or even in a public place. It can be harmful for some students and affect their normal social life.In conclusion, I that financial education will have a positive effect on all young ones and other such social commutations should be considered just as important as financial education.;In many countries, the conversation surrounding financial education is becoming increasingly urgent due to the financial challenges facing the younger generation. Some advocate for making financial education a mandatory subject in schools. A common issue among young people is their lack of knowledge on how to spend money wisely. Numerous advertisements promote the misleading notion that taking on debt is acceptable, often stating, “Only 10 dollars a week, no deposits.” Integrating financial education into school curricula could help address this issue. The primary goal of teaching financial education as a core subject is to equip young people with a fundamental understanding of money management and the risks associated with borrowing for future purchases. However, we must also consider the influence of parents in this matter. While I believe that financial education is increasingly essential and should be incorporated into school programs, parents also play a critical role in guiding their children on money management. It’s important to note that more than 70% of young people's financial support comes from their parents. Additionally, we should be cautious that a focus on financial topics doesn't lead to students becoming overly fixated on money discussions, which can negatively impact their social interactions.In conclusion, I believe that implementing financial education will have a beneficial impact on young people. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize that other social skills and communication should be prioritized alongside financial education.
1404;Full time university students spend most of the time studying. They should be doing other activities too. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Full time study in university is a great experience in life but in parallel to that students other activities such as working for their pocket money, sports, participating in debates and . People differ in their opinion if students must in other things or stay concentrated on their studies only. The discussion will be presented below, followed by my opinion.Some people say that mere studying does not youth for a country. This way, students only earn theoretical knowledge not practical. For instance, students can be their studies but at the same time when they , they fail and cannot develop their confidence and work as brilliantly as they were in university. Hence, the best approach for them to be engaged here and there for practical experience.On the other hand, others believe that building a better career is the foremost thing in today’s world. So, they are targeted to their studies and gain as much knowledge as they can. Furthermore, if they are diverted from their studies, they will not be able to their .In my point of view, there must be blending of full time education and extra activities. It refreshes students’ minds and provides more energy . Moreover, by this way, they will learn how to with other people in the society.To summarize, it can be said that it is important to concentrate on but on the other hand there must be something to keep active and relaxed being involved in games, music, work and other extra activities.;Attending university full-time can be a rewarding experience, but it often coincides with a variety of other student activities, such as working part-time, participating in sports, and engaging in debates. Opinions vary on whether students should focus solely on their studies or involve themselves in these additional pursuits. This discussion will explore both perspectives, along with my own viewpoint.Some argue that solely immersing oneself in studies does not contribute to a country's youth development. They contend that students gain primarily theoretical knowledge, lacking practical experience. For example, while students may excel academically, they can struggle in real-world situations if they have not balanced their studies with other activities that build confidence and practical skills. Therefore, engaging in various experiences is essential for their growth.Conversely, others assert that in today's competitive landscape, prioritizing education is crucial for building a successful career. They argue that students who become distracted by extracurricular activities may struggle to achieve their academic goals and miss opportunities to maximize their knowledge.In my opinion, a healthy blend of full-time education and extracurricular activities is the best approach. Such a balance refreshes students' minds and boosts their energy levels. Additionally, this involvement helps them learn to collaborate and interact with others in society.In conclusion, while focusing on education is vital, it is equally important for students to engage in activities that keep them active and relaxed, such as sports, music, and part-time work.
1293;Having a salaried job is better than being self-employed. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;If one wants to work for money, there are really only two options, working for someone else for a salary and being self-employed. Most people are involved with these two options and they both have advantages and disadvantages.Being self-employed means that the worker owns the business that is being done. This might be a small one-person business or a large company with hundreds of employees. The first advantage of this is the capacity to earn more money. If the business does very well, the income can be considerable and the owner of the company will receive the benefits. On the other hand, if business is not good, the owner’s income will be low. Self-employed people also have the benefit to some extent of choosing their working hours and holidays and they have the right to change anything within their business. With this autonomy, however, comes the pressure to succeed and the reliance on one’s employees, if there are any, to do their best to make the business thrive.Salaried workers do not experience the same stress as the self-employed owners of companies. They might have stress in their duties, but the pressure that comes with keeping one’s own business operating successfully in order to support oneself and one’s family is just not felt by an employee. The employee also has a certain knowledge of his or her income, as the salary is usually fixed every month. The self-employed owner’s income often depends on how successful the business is. The employee’s fixed income, however, does not give much scope for earning large amounts more. In addition, an employee does not have the freedoms of the owner or the autonomy, and for many people, having control over their lives is a significant factor to their well-being.It is certain that there are advantages and disadvantages for both being self-employed and salaried. I personally disagree that being salaried is better than being self-employed. I prefer the autonomy that being self-employed brings and, although there is more risk and pressure, this can lead to greater and more fulfilling rewards.;"If someone is looking to earn money, they generally have two main avenues: working for another person in exchange for a salary or being self-employed. Most individuals either pursue one of these paths, each with its own set of benefits and drawbacks.Self-employment means that individuals run their own businesses, which can range from a small solo venture to a large enterprise with numerous employees. One major advantage of self-employment is the potential for higher earnings; if the business thrives, the owner can reap significant financial rewards. However, the flip side is that if the business struggles, the owner's income can suffer. Self-employed individuals also enjoy some degree of flexibility in choosing their working hours and vacation time, as well as the freedom to make changes within their business. This freedom comes with the responsibility to succeed, and for those with employees, it also means relying on their team's performance to ensure the business flourishes.On the other hand, salaried employees generally face less stress compared to self-employed business owners. While they may experience pressure related to their specific tasks, they do not carry the burden of ensuring that a business remains profitable enough to support themselves and their families. Employees benefit from a predictable income, as salaries are usually fixed monthly. In contrast, a self-employed individual's earnings can fluctuate significantly based on the business's success. However, the stability of a salary can limit opportunities for earning beyond a certain amount. Moreover, employees lack the same level of autonomy and freedom that business owners enjoy, and many people find that having control over their lives is crucial for their overall well-being.Ultimately, both self-employment and salaried positions come with their pros and cons. Personally, I believe that being self-employed offers more advantages than being salaried. I value the independence that comes with self-employment, and while it involves greater risks and pressures, it can also lead to more rewarding and fulfilling outcomes."
1339;High-rise vs. low-rise buildings, which solution is better for a growing population?;Some cities create new housing for their growing populations by constructing a smaller number of high-rise buildings. Other cities create more of low-rise buildings. Which solution is better, in your opinion?Sample EssayRising population in urban areas leaves governments with no choice but to build more houses to meet the demand. However, when it comes to construction, there is more than one way to build new homes. Some cities prefer to construct fewer residential towers, while others build a larger number of low-rises for their residents. In this essay both options will be discussed and a viable solution will be suggested.One advantage of tall buildings is that they can accommodate a large number of people while having a small footprint. This type of construction is popular in central city areas where land is scarce and expensive. For example, in New York City high-rise buildings have significantly reduced housing problems, by as much as 55% in the last few years. As a result of this strategy, rents tend to decrease which has a further positive impact on the economies of such cities. However, tall buildings offer little or no privacy, they force certain rules and regulations upon residents, and attract higher maintenance costs.Given a chance to voice their opinion, many individuals would prefer to live in low-rise buildings or even build their own houses. This option might be more attractive for big families and for older generation people who like to have their own personal space. Accessibility is also a concern for the elderly as taking the stairs when the lifts break down may not be an option for them. In addition, one or two-story houses are easier and cheaper to maintain compared to modern apartment towers. The downside of this type of dwellings is that they occupy much more land, and since land is cheaper on city fringes, new estates tend to be built away from city centres. This increases commute time to work for their residents and negatively affects their quality of life.In conclusion, high-rise and low-rise buildings have their unique advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, high rises are more suitable for younger residents and should be built in the areas where young population is prevalent, closer to the city centre and employment opportunities. Senior citizens should have a supply of lower dwellings available in quieter locations. Such flexible approach can be a good way to address the needs of growing city’s population.;As urban populations increase, cities face the necessity of building more housing to satisfy demand. There are different approaches to construction: some cities opt for fewer high-rise buildings, while others prefer a greater number of low-rise structures. This essay will explore both options and propose a practical solution.One significant advantage of high-rise buildings is their ability to house large populations on a smaller footprint. This option is particularly favored in densely populated city centers where land is limited and expensive. For instance, New York City has notably alleviated its housing challenges, achieving up to a 55% reduction in issues related to housing shortages in recent years through the construction of high-rises. Consequently, this strategy often leads to lower rents, which can positively impact the local economy. However, living in tall buildings may result in less privacy, stricter regulations, and higher maintenance expenses for residents.Conversely, many people would prefer living in low-rise buildings or even in their own homes. This choice is especially appealing to large families and older individuals who value personal space. Additionally, accessibility is a concern for senior citizens who may struggle with stairs if elevators are out of service. Low-rise homes are generally easier and more affordable to maintain compared to modern high-rise apartments. Nevertheless, one drawback of this housing type is its larger land requirement. Since land is typically more economical on the outskirts of cities, new low-rise developments are often built away from urban centers, resulting in longer commutes for residents and potentially diminishing their quality of life.In conclusion, both high-rise and low-rise buildings present distinct benefits and drawbacks. I believe that high-rises are more suitable for a younger demographic and should be constructed in areas with a significant young population, preferably closer to city centers and job opportunities. Meanwhile, older adults would benefit from the availability of low-rise housing in quieter neighborhoods. This adaptable approach could effectively meet the diverse needs of an expanding urban population.
1365;IELTS Essay, topic: Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between the rich and poor, while others disagree (discuss);Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between rich and poor people, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.There is no doubt that modern technology is reshaping our planet and affecting every aspect of human lives. From a social perspective, many people argue that the gap between the upper class and lower classes is widening as a result of technological advancements. Others, however, believe the opposite.There are several reasons why one could think that the wealth inequality is, indeed, increasing. The most common reason is automation. Driven by technology, automation reduces the need for manual labour. As a result, less work opportunities are available for unskilled people. With each iteration of the cycle the competition increases and wages decrease. , technology has increased the minimum level of needs that should be satisfied. Nowadays, everybody should have a mobile phone and an internet connection, including the poor. This increases the monetary burden on them as they must borrow to cover these new needs.However, I firmly believe that the aforementioned opinion is ludicrous. The most obvious reason is that modern technology has facilitated the road to riches in an unprecedented manner. For instance, many of the internet billionaires are from lower and middle classes. Moreover, the major leaps in agricultural technologies magnified food production. As a result, food has become more affordable and available. Finally, leveraging technology has dramatically increased workers’ productivity. Consequently, compensations and salaries have increased.In conclusion, I strongly believe that technology could possibly narrow the difference between social classes. Increased food production, opportunities and productivity are just few examples of technology’s contribution to bridging the wealth gap.This essay adequately covers all parts of the task. The ideas expressed in this written response are relevant, well-developed, ordered in a logical way and supported. The paragraphing is suitable and cohesion is maintained throughout the essay. A good range of vocabulary and the writer’s fluency are evident. There are no spelling errors and very few mistakes in word choice and grammar, most sentences are error-free. The essay is likely to get Band 8 in IELTS.;Some people argue that modern technology is exacerbating the divide between the wealthy and the impoverished, while others hold a different view. This essay will explore both perspectives and present my own opinion.There’s no denying that modern technology is transforming our world and influencing nearly every facet of human existence. From a societal viewpoint, many contend that technological progress is widening the gap between the affluent and the less fortunate. On the other hand, some individuals disagree with this notion.There are several arguments supporting the belief that wealth inequality is indeed intensifying. A primary factor is automation, which, propelled by technology, diminishes the demand for manual labor. Consequently, there are fewer job opportunities for unskilled workers, leading to heightened competition and reduced wages. Additionally, technology has raised the baseline of necessities that individuals feel compelled to fulfill. Today, owning a mobile phone and having internet access are considered essential, even for those with limited financial means. This creates an additional financial strain, prompting those in poverty to borrow money to meet these newfound demands.However, I strongly maintain that such a viewpoint is misguided. A significant reason supporting my stance is that modern technology has opened doors to wealth generation in ways never seen before. For example, numerous internet billionaires have emerged from lower and middle-class backgrounds. Furthermore, advancements in agricultural technology have significantly increased food production, making food both more affordable and accessible. Lastly, technology has greatly enhanced worker productivity, resulting in higher salaries and improved compensation.In summary, I firmly believe that technology has the potential to diminish the disparities between social classes. The increase in food production, the creation of new opportunities, and the boost in productivity are just a few examples illustrating technology's role in bridging the wealth gap. This essay effectively addresses all aspects of the topic, presenting relevant and well-developed ideas structured logically and coherently. The use of appropriate paragraphing and cohesive elements supports the flow of the discussion. The essay demonstrates a robust range of vocabulary and fluency, with minimal errors in spelling, word choice, and grammar. It has the potential to achieve a Band 8 in the IELTS.
1388;In many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?;Nowadays, many children involved in different types of jobs to have some kind of financial assurance for themselves. However, whether this is good for their development and personality is a controversial issue. I personally believe that paid works is harmful for children for several reasons.It is said that children gain valuable experience in the work place. This may be true. However, I would argue that children are mainly employed in jobs that require manual work and are poorly paid. The recent statistics reveal the common tasks that children are assigned to are washing dishes, mopping floors or serving food in restaurants. Meanwhile, this kind of jobs actually provide children with necessary and useful skills to apply in their future .This brings me to the second point. Defenders of child labour that it is an effective method of learning. The point is children should be able to apply knowledge taught to them in a real life working environment. Although this is undoubtedly true, it also means that children may neglect the classroom study and even fail the class. The worst thing is yet to come. They may become so preoccupied with the benefits ahead of them such as small salary that they may leave school.Finally, supporters say that it helps them to build responsibility in the family. They will understand how it is difficult to earn money and therefore have compassion for their parents. This is true to a certain extent, but may have a totally adverse effect on children. As children can make money at an early age, they would feel that it is appropriate to spend it on luxury things.In conclusion, I think that parents should take measures to restrict their child from work, otherwise it would have negative consequences to their future.;In today's world, many children take on various jobs in search of financial security. However, the impact of this practice on their development and character remains a contentious topic. I believe that paid work can be detrimental to children for several reasons.It's often claimed that children benefit from valuable work experience, which may hold some truth. However, most jobs available to them tend to involve manual labor and low wages. Recent statistics show that common tasks assigned to children include washing dishes, mopping floors, and serving food in restaurants. While these roles may impart certain skills, they do not equip children with the more comprehensive skills needed for their future.Another argument made by proponents of child labor is that it serves as an effective means of learning. They contend that children should apply their classroom knowledge in real-world settings. While this is certainly valid, it can also lead children to neglect their studies and ultimately face academic failure. The situation worsens when children become overly focused on the immediate financial benefits, which might tempt them to drop out of school.Additionally, supporters argue that working helps children develop a sense of responsibility and appreciate the efforts of their parents to earn a living. While this may hold some truth, it can also lead to unintended consequences. Children who earn money at a young age may begin to feel entitled to spend it on luxurious items rather than understanding the value of saving or budgeting.In conclusion, I believe that parents should take steps to limit their children's work involvement, as it can have negative repercussions for their future.
1411;In many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it to be a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion on this?;In the Third World, children are usually sent to factories for laborious work. Many people believe that it is merely exploitation, while others think it is a good opportunity for them to life experience. In any case, children have their right to live and study in peaceful conditions. Therefore, using them as workforce is considered an unacceptable action.First of all, children are not workers. They have just learned about the vast world and do not have any experience or concept of working. Since these innocent children are naive and , they can be easily cheated and exploited. There are many examples of this in poor nations. Because using children is cheap and to control, many enterprises hire them and don’t pay them much. Although the government in these countries has tried its best, this kind of taking advantage of children cannot be eliminated.Moreover, children do not need such thing as ‘valuable work experience’ that is supposedly ‘important for learning and taking responsibility’. The brief responsibility of children is learning. They are not old enough to understand what working experiences are. Nevertheless, they can help parents do chores or housework. This will be a much better way for them to become more responsible for . In addition, childhood is one of the most remarkable memories and must not be taken away by forcing them to work.In conclusion, since all children are the great concern of parent and society, they should be allowed to enjoy life and rather than to work. Hence, one must ponder what view is actually appropriate for the sake of the children.;In developing countries, children are often sent to work in factories. While some people argue that this is a form of exploitation, others see it as a valuable opportunity for gaining life experience. Regardless of perspective, every child has the right to live and learn in a peaceful environment, which makes the use of child labor unacceptable.Firstly, children are not meant to be workers. They are still discovering the world around them and lack the experience needed for such responsibilities. Their innocence and naivety make them vulnerable to manipulation and exploitation. Numerous examples from poorer nations illustrate how children can be easily taken advantage of. Many businesses employ children because they can pay them low wages and exert control over them. Despite the efforts of governments in these regions, the exploitation of children persists.Additionally, the notion that children require 'valuable work experience' to learn responsibility is misguided. Their primary duty is to learn and grow, and they are not yet capable of grasping the complexities of work experience. Instead, children can assist their parents with chores, which offers a better way for them to develop a sense of responsibility. Childhood should be cherished as a unique and wonderful time, not marred by forced labor.In conclusion, the well-being of children is a significant concern for both parents and society. They should be allowed to enjoy their childhood rather than being thrust into work. It is essential to reflect on what truly serves the best interests of children.
361;In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?;"Money can not buy happiness! Is one of the most famous sayings while talking about finances. It is argued that topics around money, wealth, and poverty are becoming dramatically more frequent between humans in different countries around the world. In my opinion, the extream part of it is a negative development; although, it has some positivities. I will address some of both sides in this essay.Talking about money during the major part of the day might make the person look stingy and this is an attitude that majority of the community would not like, thus, might effect on the person's social life. Moreover, having the same topic in mind all day might lead to an obsession, and as a result, this could lead to a depression because the person might not find the proper way to reach to the financial position that meets their satisfaction, which could lead to depression, or even worse such as going through illegal paths where it could destroy their lives entirely!Nevertheless, the person should be aware of his /her income and spendings and try to enhance their financial position to the best possible way. Also, the inflation that we are currently living and the noticable increase in prices could be a driver for people to talk about money more often.In conclusion, people should not be obssessed in money and to talk with everyone about it all the time. However, I believe that people should discuss this matter in order to benefit from each other, and to find more ways to enhance their quality of life.";"""Money can't buy happiness"" is a well-known saying in discussions about finances. There's an ongoing debate about how conversations surrounding money, wealth, and poverty are increasingly prevalent among people worldwide. In my view, while there are some positive aspects to this trend, it predominantly represents a negative development. In this essay, I will explore both sides of the argument.Constantly discussing money throughout the day can create an impression of stinginess, a trait that many in society may find unappealing. This could negatively impact an individual's social life. Furthermore, preoccupation with financial matters can lead to obsession, potentially resulting in depression if one feels unable to attain their desired financial stability. In some cases, this desperation might drive individuals towards illegal activities, jeopardizing their lives even further.On the other hand, it is important for individuals to be aware of their income and expenditures, and to strive for financial improvement. The current reality of inflation and rising prices can also contribute to heightened discussions about money.In conclusion, while it's unwise to obsess over money or to discuss it constantly with everyone, I believe that engaging in conversations about financial matters can be beneficial. Such discussions can help people learn from one another and explore ways to improve their quality of life."
671;In many countries women and men are working full time. It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;I strongly agree with this statement. If women and men are both working full time, they should share household works.First of all, if women and men are working full time, and they are working in the same amount of time, logically, the amount of time they do household works should be the sam e. However, if one of them work for longer hours, the household works should still be shared but the other one should do more household works.Second of all, everyone have responsibility to do household works because everyone lives in the house, makes the house dirty, creates dirty clothes and dishes. If there is only either women or men doing household works, it is not fair at all, because they both work full time.But as I mentioned before, the amount of time doing household works can be arranged, it doesn't have to be evenly shared. For instance, if the woman in this family work for longer hours or got an extra call by work, the man should help and do her part of household works. And when the man are working more, the woman should do the same. This does not only solve the problem of who should do household works but can also show that women and men are supporting each other in various situations.In conclusion, when women and men are both doing full time jobs, they should share household works. But it doesn't have to to be split in two halves, it can have alternatives depending on the working hours or special situations. In this way, the house can be more peaceful and have more harmony without arguments about who should do the household works.;"I wholeheartedly agree with this statement. When both women and men are employed full-time, they should share household responsibilities.Firstly, if two individuals are working the same number of hours, it makes sense that their household duties should also be equally divided. However, if one person works longer hours, the chores should still be apportioned fairly, with the other person taking on a larger share of the household tasks.Secondly, everyone has a responsibility to contribute to household chores, as we all create messes and generate dirty laundry and dishes. It is unfair for only one partner—whether a woman or a man—to handle these tasks when both are working full time.As I mentioned earlier, the division of household responsibilities doesn’t have to be equal. For example, if the woman in a household is putting in longer hours or receiving extra work calls, the man should step in and take on more of the chores, and vice versa when the man works longer hours. This approach not only addresses the issue of household duties but also demonstrates mutual support between partners during different circumstances.In conclusion, when both women and men have full-time jobs, they should collaborate on household tasks. The division doesn’t need to be split fifty-fifty; it can vary based on individual work hours and unique situations. This flexibility fosters a more harmonious and peaceful home environment, eliminating conflicts over who should take care of the chores."
1343;In many countries young people start living on their own after high school, is this a positive or negative development?;In many countries around the world young people decide to leave their parents’ home once they finish school. They start living on their own or sharing a house with friends. Is this a positive or a negative development? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples.Sample EssayNowadays it is becoming increasingly common for youngsters to start their independent life by moving out of their parents’ home after graduation from school. This trend has positive effects on the society and the reasons behind it will be discussed next in this essay.There are various benefits for both young people and their parents when individuals start living independently after finishing school. Young adults, in this way, have to take care of their daily needs, from house chores, cooking or cleaning to financial independence. Thus, instead of wasting time on childish activities, they are motivated to learn skills and work part-time or full-time in order to cover their living expenses. Although it might seem challenging for them to live on their own at first, it would give them valuable experience, helping them to become mature, responsible adults. Parents would also be pleased with this practice since they can enjoy their own lives by having more time for themselves. Not only would they have more financial flexibility due to independence of their children, but they also don’t have to change their habits in order to adapt to the new generation’s lifestyle. For instance, it allows many people to travel around the world, which would be impossible if their children were to stay with them after finishing high school.Admittedly, there might be some challenges involved in this way of life. In some cases and especially under the influence of new friends or housemates, youngsters might choose to get involved in dangerous activities that involve drugs or petty crimes. However, instead of keeping their children close through adulthood, parents should prepare in advance and raise their children to distinguish between right and wrong and teach them to take responsibility for their actions.In conclusion, although there might be some adverse consequences to this relatively new practice, I believe that the advantages of young people leaving family home outweigh its drawbacks, for both children and parents.;In numerous countries worldwide, many young individuals opt to leave their parents' home after completing their education. They begin to live independently or share accommodations with friends. Is this a positive or negative trend? This essay will discuss the reasons supporting this development.In recent years, it has become increasingly common for young people to embark on their independent journeys by moving out of their parents' homes after graduating from school. This trend has its benefits for both the young adults and their parents, which will be explored further in this essay.There are several advantages for both young individuals and their parents when children start living on their own post-education. For young adults, this experience encourages them to manage their daily responsibilities, including household tasks, cooking, cleaning, and achieving financial independence. Instead of engaging in frivolous activities, they are driven to acquire essential life skills and may take on part-time or full-time work to support their living costs. While transitioning to independence may initially pose challenges, it ultimately equips them with valuable life experiences, fostering maturity and responsibility. Parents also benefit from this shift, as they gain more freedom and personal time, allowing them to pursue their interests. Financially, they experience relief, as the independence of their children lessens their financial burdens. For example, this newfound freedom often enables parents to travel the world, which would not be as feasible if their children remained at home after high school.It is important to acknowledge that there are potential challenges associated with this lifestyle. In some instances, particularly influenced by new friends or roommates, young people may engage in risky behaviors related to drugs or petty crimes. However, rather than keeping their children close into adulthood, parents should proactively prepare them by instilling a sense of morality and helping them understand the consequences of their actions.In conclusion, despite some possible negative outcomes associated with this relatively new practice, I believe that the benefits of young individuals leaving their family homes far outweigh the drawbacks, for both the children and their parents.
1320;In many countries, a lot of food is wasted. Why do people waste food? How can we reduce the amount of food waste?;"Despite the fact that millions of people in the world go hungry every day, a surprisingly large amount of food gets wasted daily in certain parts of the world. In my opinion, the main reason for this is that people in the first-world countries tend to only buy food that is aesthetically pleasing, and fortunately, there are some ways to tackle this issue.It is shockingly sad to know that large amounts of perfectly edible food in the form of fresh produce get sent to landfills, and the main reason for this is that these foods do not meet the standards of perfection set for fruits and vegetables by consumers and grocery stores. For example, veggies and fruit that are misshapen or have a few spots on them are still good enough to eat, yet they are often left on shelves to rot in favour of something that looks less damaged. In addition, a lot of customers confuse the ‘best by’ and ‘use by’ dates, thinking that foods that have passed their ‘best by’ dates are no longer fit to eat. Another major reason for food wastage is that people often overestimate the amount of produce they require on a weekly or monthly basis, and most of it ends up getting thrown out instead of being used.There are many ways to reduce the amount of food being wasted, and I think one of the best ideas is to increase people’s awareness of just how much good food is disposed of, only because of our superficial biases as to how food should look. Raising the awareness of the staggering number of people that go hungry in third-world countries would make it harder to throw away an apple just because it is a little bruised. Also, teaching people how to better plan their monthly food requirements would help them not to overspend on food that they do not need; it would be great for the environment and their budget. The role of the government in this endeavour is indispensable as such task would be too great for any smaller organisation.To conclude, the wasting food is a serious issue that merits increased awareness from both people and the leaders of the world. It is unacceptable to discard any food when there are so many people who are starving, and hopefully our joint effort can help improve the current situation.";While millions of people around the globe face hunger daily, it’s astonishing how much food goes to waste in certain regions. In my view, one of the primary reasons for this is that individuals in developed countries tend to favor food that looks perfect. Fortunately, there are effective strategies to address this challenge. It’s disheartening to realize that vast quantities of perfectly edible fresh produce end up in landfills simply because they don’t conform to the unrealistic standards of perfection set by consumers and grocery stores. For instance, fruits and vegetables that are slightly misshapen or show minor blemishes are still perfectly safe to eat, yet they are often left to decay while shoppers opt for more visually appealing options. Furthermore, many customers misunderstand ‘best by’ and ‘use by’ dates, wrongly believing that items past their ‘best by’ date are no longer consumable. Additionally, a common issue is that people frequently misjudge how much produce they truly need, leading to surplus that ultimately gets discarded. There are numerous strategies to minimize food waste, and one of the most effective approaches could be raising awareness about the volume of perfectly good food that is thrown away due to our superficial perceptions of its appearance. Highlighting the staggering rates of hunger in developing countries might make individuals think twice before discarding a slightly bruised apple. Moreover, educating consumers on how to plan their food purchases more effectively could help prevent unnecessary overspending and waste, benefiting both their finances and the environment. The government's involvement is essential in this effort, as the scale of the task is too large for smaller organizations to tackle alone.In conclusion, food waste is a significant issue that requires heightened awareness from both individuals and world leaders. It is unacceptable to discard food when so many people suffer from hunger, and with collective efforts, we can strive to improve this situation.
1331;In many countries, young people are finding it harder and harder to find permanent jobs. Why is this happening? What can be done to improve the situation?;In this fast-moving age, with the development of education and modern technologies, people strive to have a secure job after graduating from colleges and universities. Despite their efforts, so many young adults in different parts of the world have a negative experience of finding a long-term job.It so happens that most colleges and universities focus on students’ academic performance much more than their practical skills. Unfortunately, many companies reserve permanent job opportunities for experienced applicants because there is no need to invest much in their training. Lack of practical experience in new graduates puts them at a disadvantage as far as companies are concerned. The situation is made worse by the abundance of advanced technologies that can easily replace human labor. Robots and computers work more efficiently and with higher precision than humans. That shrinks the pool of available job placements even more, as companies only need to hire highly educated and experienced staff.Fortunately, there is a number of solutions that can help inexperienced workers gain permanent employment. An obvious one is that universities could offer internships to their students, or arrange workshops in addition to classwork. This would help students to get training and experience in their respective fields. Also, the government could examine the demands of changing labor market and steer young people towards professions that will be popular in the coming years. Together with colleges and universities the government could create special awareness programs for graduates, providing them with an overview of various job offers and their benefits. This way students would be able to choose the right jobs for themselves.To sum up, lack of demand in the labour market and insufficient experience are two major reasons why many young people have trouble finding a permanent position. Helping them gain hands-on experience as part of their studies and educating them about career options early on is key to improving the employment outcome for them.;In today's rapidly evolving world, driven by advancements in education and technology, individuals increasingly aspire to secure stable employment upon graduating from colleges and universities. However, many young adults across various regions encounter difficulties in landing long-term positions despite their best efforts. This challenge largely stems from the emphasis most educational institutions place on academic performance, often at the expense of developing practical skills. As a result, many businesses prefer to hire experienced applicants for permanent roles, as they require less investment in training. Consequently, new graduates find themselves at a disadvantage due to their limited real-world experience.The problem is exacerbated by the prevalence of advanced technologies, such as robots and computers, which can perform tasks more efficiently and accurately than humans. This further narrows the job market, as companies increasingly seek highly educated and experienced candidates.Fortunately, several strategies could assist inexperienced workers in securing permanent employment. One solution is for universities to provide students with internship opportunities or organize workshops alongside traditional coursework. Such initiatives would equip students with essential training and experience in their chosen fields. Additionally, the government could analyze the evolving labor market to guide young individuals toward emerging professions that are poised for growth in the coming years. By collaborating with educational institutions, the government could also develop awareness programs for graduates, highlighting various job opportunities and their respective advantages. This would empower students to make informed decisions about their career paths.In conclusion, the lack of demand in the labor market coupled with inadequate experience are significant factors contributing to the difficulties many young people face in securing stable employment. Facilitating practical experience during their studies and providing early career education are crucial steps toward enhancing their job prospects.
1318;In many workplaces online communication has overtaken face to face meetings. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?;In today’s ever-increasingly digital world, online communication has become the norm for many workplaces. While this development offers numerous advantages for companies such as greater flexibility and efficiency, it also brings with it certain disadvantages like miscommunication, which must be weighed against its benefits.One of the primary advantages of online communication is that it makes it easier for teams to stay in touch without having to physically convene. This is especially beneficial when individuals or groups are dispersed across vast distances. Reduced travel costs, as well as time saved from not having to travel to and from meetings, also represent meaningful savings for businesses. Additionally, online communication platforms often have a range of features designed to make collaboration more efficient, such as providing an easy way to share documents and other materials with remote team members. To illustrate, digital resources can be sent quickly and securely via email or other software services like Dropbox or Google Drive.There is a potential drawback associated with relying too heavily on online communication at work, as the lack of physical proximity between members of a team can often lead to misunderstandings due to a loss of context or nonverbal cues that would otherwise be present during face-to-face meetings. However, in my opinion, issues of this nature can be solved by using written language more carefully to avoid any confusion or miscommunication among colleagues.In conclusion, when online communication tools are used properly, they undoubtedly provide companies with greater flexibility in how their teams collaborate without sacrificing clarity of communication, quality or efficiency.;In today's increasingly digital landscape, online communication has become the standard for many organizations. While this shift offers significant advantages, such as improved flexibility and efficiency, it also presents challenges, notably the risk of miscommunication, which must be carefully considered alongside the benefits.One key benefit of online communication is that it facilitates connectivity among team members without the need for in-person meetings. This is particularly advantageous for teams spread across large geographical areas. The reduction in travel expenses, along with the time saved from not having to commute for meetings, translates into substantial cost savings for businesses. Moreover, many online communication platforms come equipped with features that enhance collaboration, such as the ability to easily share documents and resources with remote colleagues. For instance, files can be swiftly and securely exchanged through email or cloud services like Dropbox or Google Drive.However, there is a potential downside to over-relying on online communication in the workplace. The physical distance between team members can lead to misunderstandings, as important nonverbal cues and context may be lost compared to face-to-face interactions. Nonetheless, I believe that these issues can be mitigated by using clear and precise written communication, which helps minimize the chances of confusion among colleagues.In summary, when used effectively, online communication tools can greatly enhance a company's flexibility in team collaboration while maintaining clarity, quality, and efficiency in communication.
713;In many workplaces, online communication is getting more common than meeting face to face. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?;According to COVID-19 event forced many company to change their way of working. One of the most significant transformation is the communication. The online communication becomes a must or inevitable for the company to be implemented. In this topic, we're going to disscuss the advantages and disadvantages for both ways of communications. The online meeting can introduce a significant impact to the organization while face to face meeting can be outdated for this new era of 2021.First of all for the online communication's advantages is that in the pandemic period the actual physical contact is a significant way to transmit the disease. Video conference can help mitigate this problem by lower the physical contact for each conversation or meeting. Also communicates through online channel can help individual to organize or manage their time efficiently according to each person preference. For example, a single mom parent may be able to spend times for her sons/daughters at home, while be able to have a cross country meeting with another department in other region. Another reason is that some people are quite introvert and find it difficult for face to face human interactions or conversations, in which online chat or messages can help them to mitigate this problem and communicate efficiently. Lastly as mentioned about video conference across region, online meeting can help the multi-national corporates save the transporations cost and additional resources needed to spend for face to face meeting.For the disadvantages, all of the online communications required hardware, internet connection and technological knowledge on how to use them. This technological gap can be seen as one of the most significant obstracle or disadvantage for people to use online communications. For example, in one company, there obviously have a various age of people, in which some of them are not familiar with the technology. Since video call conference has been introduced and utilized widespread among corporates not so long time ago. This can be a big technological gap for some people to use the online communications and result in a lost in communications among the workplaces.As a result, online communication helps an organization to reduce the risk of transmitting the disease, improved the time mangement ability and productivity for each individuals, and lower the financial cost or resources required to spends for international business activities. With all these advantages of online communication stated, they can be seens as a significant reasons to outweight the disadvantages of technological gap on this current year of 2021.;The COVID-19 pandemic has compelled many companies to reevaluate their operational methods, leading to significant changes, particularly in communication. Online communication has become essential for organizations, prompting a discussion of its benefits and drawbacks compared to traditional face-to-face interactions, which may seem outdated in the current landscape of 2021.One of the primary advantages of online communication during the pandemic is the reduction of physical contact, which is crucial for minimizing the spread of the virus. Video conferencing facilitates conversations and meetings while lowering exposure risk. Additionally, online communication allows individuals to manage their time more effectively based on personal preferences. For instance, a single parent can balance spending time with their children at home while participating in a virtual meeting with colleagues from another region. Furthermore, for those who are introverted or uncomfortable with in-person interactions, online chats and messaging provide a more accessible way to communicate. Lastly, virtual meetings can significantly reduce transportation costs and logistical resources for multinational corporations.However, there are also drawbacks to online communication. It requires the necessary hardware, a stable internet connection, and technological know-how. This creates a potential barrier for individuals who may not be familiar with the technology, particularly considering the diverse age groups within a company. For some employees, the introduction of video conferencing has contributed to a technological divide that can hinder effective communication in the workplace.In conclusion, online communication plays a vital role in helping organizations lower the risk of disease transmission, enhance individual productivity and time management, and reduce costs associated with international business operations. While there are challenges related to technological proficiency, the benefits of online communication in 2021 appear to outweigh these disadvantages.
1265;In recent years, the family structure has changed, as well as family roles. What are the changes occurring? Do you think these changes are positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In our modern days, families had witnessed a considerable change regarding their structure and the roles of individuals inside it. These changes are mainly the patriarchal structure that was dominating families in the past compared to a more balanced arrangement nowadays. In addition to that, there are more freedom and rights for women in recent years. And I believe its an advantageous development.Fathers used to be the only leaders of the families of past decades, however in recent days mothers had shared the leadership and started taking part in family decisions just like their partners. Also during recent decades women obtained greater deal of their civil rights which allowed them to take different roles from those that were common for females in the past decades. As an example, women can now own the family house, sign important documents, drive cars which were a breakthrough for women to be able to participate in family plannings and decisions.It appears to be an advantage to have women being able to be effective members of their families, that is because they can share responsibility, add their feminine qualities to the lives of their families as well as for them to be able to fulfill their own life by feeling the importance of their existence and their roles.As in a recent research that found families with women in them are happier, more content, and definitely healthier.In conclusion, the family system nowadays differs vastly from before, owing to the more roles that women are taking, and to the more rights and freedom they gained, and in my perspective it is a positive change.;In contemporary society, families have undergone significant transformations in their structure and the roles of individual members. Unlike the past, where patriarchal norms dominated family dynamics, today's families tend to exhibit a more equal distribution of responsibilities. Additionally, women have gained greater freedoms and rights in recent years, which I consider a beneficial development.Historically, fathers served as the sole leaders of the household. However, in recent times, mothers have increasingly shared this leadership role, actively participating in family decision-making alongside their partners. Furthermore, women have achieved a greater range of civil rights over the last few decades, enabling them to occupy roles that were once considered unconventional for females. For instance, women can now own property, sign important documents, and drive, thereby facilitating their involvement in family planning and decision-making.The inclusion of women as active participants in family life brings numerous advantages. Their ability to share responsibilities enhances family dynamics and introduces their unique qualities, enriching the lives of all family members. Moreover, empowering women allows them to realize their own potential and understand the significance of their contributions.Recent research supports this notion, revealing that families with women in prominent roles are generally happier, more content, and healthier overall.In conclusion, the family structure of today is markedly different from that of the past, largely due to the expanding roles of women and the rights they have gained. From my perspective, this transformation is a positive advancement.
1399;In some countries children have very strict rules of behavior, in other countries they are allowed to do almost anything they like. To what extent should children have to follow rules?;Freedom plays a pivotal role in everybody’s life. We can see in today’s modernized era that nobody likes to be restricted, whether it is a child or an adult. Some people think that there should some strict rules of behavior for children, but I disagree with this statement.that sometimes more restrictions can cause more frustration in children, which leads to many other mental problems as well. they can . Sometimes they feel under pressure, which can be the main reason for their poor performance in their field. In some cases children may insist on doing .In other words we have to look other aspects as well, if we usually ignore our children’s bad habits, then they good human beings in their future life. Moreover if we never draw attention the children’s main activities then they might end up in a bad company. They the value of respect for their elders importance of relationships. They their cultural values as well.In a nutshell, I would like to say that children should be the value of their customs, rituals and respect towards their elders for their future life, but most of the additional restriction should . It would good human beings in their future.;"Freedom is essential to everyone’s life. In today’s modern world, people of all ages resist restrictions. While some believe that strict behavioral rules are necessary for children, I strongly disagree. Excessive limitations can often lead to frustration, which may result in various mental health issues. Children who feel pressured may struggle and perform poorly in different areas of their lives. It’s important to consider multiple aspects of a child's development. Ignoring their negative behaviors does not benefit them; instead, we should guide them to cultivate good habits for a better future. Additionally, if we overlook their main activities, they may fall into bad company. Children need to understand the value of respect for their elders, the importance of relationships, and their cultural values.In summary, while it is important for children to appreciate their customs, rituals, and respect for elders, imposing excessive restrictions can be detrimental. Striking a balance is key to fostering well-rounded individuals who will grow into responsible adults."
681;In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development;Nowadays, many businesses have to compete each other in order to survive from the rapidly changing world, leading to the high amount of time that employees spend on working. There are also other reasons why the employees work for a long period which I will discuss in this essay. In terms of consequences, I personally believe that spending most of our time at work is the negative development.It is the fact that people have various rationales to work for long hours. A classic example is the dynamic working condition. There are many companies that provide services such as consultation to customers, meaning that if their service does not completely satisfy the clients’ need, such client may decide to use the service from other competitors. Hence, the employees are required to dedicate their time to deliver the best service to the clients. Another common criticism is a bright career path. When the employees work for a long period, they can carefully check their works and, as a result, delivery the works with less mistakes. Doing this way could impress their manager and they are likely to get promotion in return.With a careful consideration regarding the consequence of working for long hours, there are many vital drawbacks. An obvious effect is the increase in illness. People who work very hard have to spend a lot of their time at work. Therefore, they may not have enough time to do exercises, weakening the immune system of their body. Furthermore, with the rise in the amount of working hours, people tend to lack social skills. This is because they may not be able to manage time to join social events or meet their friends, resulting in the less ability to adapt to new environments.In conclusion, it is undeniable that people work for long hours because of the requirement in business and personal career goal which, in my opinion, leads to negative development for themselves. This is because this behavior negatively affects their health condition and social competency which are the two most important aspects in our life.;In today's fast-paced world, many businesses find themselves in fierce competition, which has resulted in employees dedicating extensive hours to their work. There are various reasons behind the long working hours of employees, which I will explore in this essay. I believe that spending excessive time at work represents a negative trend.One significant reason people work long hours is the demanding nature of the modern workplace. Many companies offer services such as consulting, and if clients do not feel fully satisfied, they may turn to competitors. As a result, employees are compelled to invest considerable time and effort to ensure they meet clients' expectations. Additionally, the pursuit of career advancement is another motivating factor. By working longer hours, employees can meticulously review their tasks, ultimately leading to higher quality output with fewer mistakes. This dedication can impress supervisors and increase the likelihood of promotions.However, the repercussions of prolonged work hours are concerning. One major consequence is a heightened risk of illness. Employees who overwork themselves often neglect exercise, which can weaken their immune systems. Moreover, extended work hours can lead to a decline in social skills. With limited time to attend social gatherings or spend with friends, individuals may struggle to adapt to new environments.In conclusion, while there are business demands and personal ambitions encouraging long working hours, I believe this trend has negative implications. It adversely affects individuals' health and social skills, both of which are crucial to a fulfilling life.
101;In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .;Over decades, there has been a belief that adults should support adolescents to work in a company or travel to another country at least one year before going to university. Despite the fact that there are many positive aspects of having experiences in terms of working and travelling before studying at university, with a careful consideration, there are also negative points of this.It is true that working or travelling before starting a university program positively affects juveniles’ development. A classic example of this is an effective way to truly understand their academic preferences. When juveniles have work experiences, such as having a one-year internship in a company, they tend to learn a wide variety of work functions, helping them know the academic discipline they want to learn at university. Another benefit from taking a long journey to another place before studying at university is the opportunity to get exposed to new culture. This is because while adolescents are on an epic expedition to other parts of the world, they tend to meet new people with different nationality and belief, leading to valuable life experiences that they cannot receive from a professor at university.In spite of the aforementioned advantages of working or travelling before starting university courses, there are also drawbacks. A common example of this is graduating from a college late, compared to juveniles who immediately start a university program after they finish high school. This is exemplified by Thai culture which believes that young people who graduate from university later than their peer would not have a successful career path. In addition, opponents of this notion might argue that working before finishing university is not well worth doing. Since most works require a strong academic foundation in order for juveniles to deliver results with fewer mistakes, the juveniles should study at university instead.In conclusion, it is undeniable that having work experiences or taking a journey before starting a university life has many benefits for young people with respect to knowing the academic fields they want to study and learning new cultures outside a classroom. Nevertheless, doing this could also have drawbacks in terms of the delay in university graduation and an ineffective performance in working.;"For many years, it has been widely believed that adults should encourage adolescents to gain work experience or travel abroad for at least a year before entering university. While there are numerous benefits to such experiences, there are also some potential downsides that merit careful consideration.Engaging in work or travel prior to starting university can significantly enhance a young person’s development. For instance, gaining work experience, such as completing a year-long internship, allows adolescents to explore various job functions and better understand their academic interests. Additionally, traveling exposes them to new cultures and perspectives. During their adventures abroad, young people often meet individuals from diverse backgrounds, which enriches their understanding of the world—an education that extends beyond any traditional classroom setting.Despite these advantages, there are notable drawbacks to delaying university enrollment for work or travel. One significant concern is the potential for graduating late compared to peers who proceed directly to university after high school. In some cultures, such as Thailand, there is a prevailing belief that those who take longer to graduate may struggle to secure successful careers. Moreover, critics argue that gaining work experience before completing a degree may not be as beneficial as it seems. Many jobs require a solid academic foundation for young people to perform effectively and minimize errors; therefore, pursuing university studies immediately may be the more prudent choice.In summary, while there are clear benefits to work and travel experiences before entering university—such as clarifying academic goals and broadening cultural awareness—there are also significant challenges, including delayed graduation and potential underperformance in the workplace."
1304;In some countries, boys and girls are educated separately after the age of about ten years old. Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;In many countries around the world, boys and girls are educated together. There is a group of countries, however, that educate boys and girls separately. This is frequently done on religious grounds, but not always. Having such a system can produce various advantages and disadvantages.One of the principal reasons for educating boys and girls separately is that, if they are together, they can distract each other. After puberty, boys can be strongly attracted to girls and vice versa, and this can result in disruptive conduct in the classroom as, for example, they show off to one another. Separating boys and girls can therefore have the distinct advantage of reducing this disturbing behaviour. However, some teachers have pointed out that this model does not always work, and that separated boys and girls are equally disruptive in class, and sometimes more so. These teachers say that having the opposite sex in the classroom can actually improve behaviour.Many educators also believe that boys and girls have different learning styles and needs. Separating boys and girls can allow teachers to address these needs more easily. There is also a belief that single sex schools allow gender stereotypes to be challenged and therefore education aspirations can be broadened.A major disadvantage of separating boys and girls in education is that the children miss important formative behavioural development when they do not have interaction with the other gender on a regular basis. This can lead to shyness and, more seriously, dysfunctional relationships later in life. Some people also feel that mixed sex schools can promote gender stereotypes rather than reducing them.In conclusion, I feel that children should be educated all together, although I would respect a system in which they are separated due to religious beliefs. My personal opinion is that different genders should learn to interact together from an early age, as this would allow them to develop healthy working relationships with each other.;"In numerous countries worldwide, boys and girls are educated alongside one another. However, there are some nations that choose to educate them separately, often for religious reasons, although this is not always the case. This separation can lead to various pros and cons.One key argument for single-sex education is that boys and girls can be distracting to one another when in the same classroom. After reaching puberty, boys may develop strong feelings for girls and vice versa, which can lead to disruptive behavior as they try to impress each other. Consequently, separating them could help minimize such distractions. However, some educators believe this approach does not always yield positive results; they argue that boys and girls can still be disruptive when taught in separate environments, and sometimes even more so. These teachers suggest that having both sexes in the classroom can actually foster better behavior.Moreover, many educators contend that boys and girls have distinct learning styles and needs. By separating them, teachers may find it easier to cater to these differences. There is also a belief that single-sex schools can challenge gender stereotypes and broaden educational aspirations.On the flip side, a significant drawback of separating boys and girls is that they miss out on vital social development that comes from interacting with the opposite sex. This lack of interaction may lead to shyness and potentially result in unhealthy relationships in adulthood. Additionally, some critics argue that mixed-sex environments can inadvertently reinforce gender stereotypes instead of diminishing them.In conclusion, I believe that children should be educated together, although I would respect the choice to separate them for religious reasons. In my view, early interactions between different genders can help foster healthy working relationships and social skills."
785;In some countries, only few young people go to classical music concerts or or play classical music. Why? Should young people be encouraged to attend and learn more?;Classical music is one of the oldest artistic samples of our history. However, the young people of the new generations do not appreciate this kind of music. I believe that governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and I will support my stand with valid arguments in the following paragraphs.First of all, the main reason behind the little interest of young people in classical music is the impact of globalization in music and arts. That is because people have the opportunity to know more about multiple things without leaving their homes. However, all this knowledge is only superficial and arts, more specifically classical music, is diminished by the big international industry of music. For instance, reggaeton music, despite the fact that its lyrics are often misogynous, is the most popular style of music these days.Another reason is that children and young people have less interest in cultural matters than in the past because governments do not invest in culture and arts. In most countries, investment in culture has been drastically reduced and young people have no access to classical music concerts and much less a musical instrument that has a huge cost. Consequently, governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and the arts.To summarise, this essay has examined the idea of classical music and why young people do not have an interest in this kind of music. As far as I am concerned governments should take responsibility in this matter and invest more money in culture and classical music encouraging young people to learn more about this kind of art.;Classical music stands as one of the oldest forms of artistic expression in our history. Nevertheless, younger generations seem to lack appreciation for this genre. I believe that it is essential for governments to promote a deeper understanding of classical music among youth, and I will support this viewpoint with compelling arguments in the following paragraphs.To begin with, one of the primary reasons for young people's limited interest in classical music is the influence of globalization on music and the arts. Today, individuals can easily access a wide range of cultural content from the comfort of their homes. Unfortunately, much of this exposure remains superficial, and as a result, classical music often gets overshadowed by the dominant global music industry. For example, reggaeton has emerged as a leading genre, despite its frequently misogynistic lyrics.Additionally, children and young people today exhibit less interest in cultural subjects compared to previous generations, largely due to a lack of government investment in the arts. In many countries, funding for cultural initiatives has significantly declined, leaving young people with limited access to classical music concerts and the opportunity to learn expensive musical instruments. Therefore, it is crucial for governments to actively promote and support youth engagement with classical music and the arts.In conclusion, this essay has explored the issue of classical music appreciation among young people and identified key reasons for their disinterest. I firmly believe that governments hold a responsibility to address this by increasing funding for cultural initiatives and classical music programs, thereby encouraging young individuals to explore and appreciate this timeless art form.
1334;In the modern world, it is possible to shop, work and communicate with people via the Internet and live without any face-to-face contact with others. Is it a positive or negative development?;The feasibility of shopping, working and communicating through the Internet is gradually eliminating the necessity of in-person encounters. I believe the merits of this opportunity outnumber its demerits and the lowered volume of traffic in addition to the possibility of long-range communication will be discussed as reasons for this claim in this essay.One chief benefit of using the Internet as a means of making purchases, working and communicating would be the lowered demand for transport, through eradicating the need for face-to-face contact. Such decreased volume of transportation would result in fewer harmful gas emissions which could significantly contribute to creating a cleaner environment. Furthermore, reduced commuting burden yields more free time for individuals. It could be spent in various ways such as working, studying and socialising with family and friends to name a few, which would be more productive and enjoyable.Another key merit of using the Internet would be the emergence of state-of-the-art telecommunication applications. These technologies have made it possible for those with access to the Internet to get in touch and send and receive audiovisual content by pushing just a few buttons. This presents a stark contrast to the situation only a few decades ago, when long-distance communication was possible solely through paper-based letters, which could possibly take months to reach the recipient.There are, however, some drawbacks to online communication, in particular the possibility that the lack of contact brought by technological advancements could potentially weaken human bonds. Taking into consideration that humans are sociable species, this could pose a dire threat to our mental health. This predicament, however, would be mitigated by the extra free time technological developments create for us. This free time could be spent with friends and family and in the long run would strengthen our relationships and improve our emotional wellbeing.To recapitulate, the Internet’s demolishing the need for person-to-person contact brings about numerous benefits. A more sustainable environment as well as more free time generated for individuals, a reduced need to commute in addition to the feasibility of conducting long-distance communication in the easiest way possible, are all instances of the above-mentioned merits.;The increasing ability to shop, work, and communicate online is steadily reducing the need for face-to-face interactions. I believe the advantages of this trend outweigh its disadvantages. This essay will discuss how decreased traffic and the convenience of long-distance communication support this viewpoint.One significant advantage of utilizing the Internet for shopping, work, and communication is the reduced demand for transportation, eliminating the need for in-person meetings. This decline in transportation usage can lead to lower emissions of harmful gases, greatly contributing to a cleaner environment. Additionally, less time spent commuting allows individuals to enjoy more leisure time, which can be devoted to productive activities like working, studying, or socializing with family and friends.Another important benefit of the Internet is the advancement of innovative telecommunication tools. These technologies enable individuals with Internet access to easily connect and share audiovisual content with just a few clicks. This is a remarkable improvement compared to a few decades ago when long-distance communication relied on paper letters, which could take weeks or even months to arrive.Nevertheless, there are some drawbacks to online communication, particularly the risk that the diminished face-to-face contact may weaken human connections. Given that humans are inherently social beings, this could pose a threat to mental well-being. However, the time saved through technological advancements can help offset this issue. This extra time can be used to nurture relationships with friends and family, ultimately enhancing emotional health.In summary, the Internet’s reduction of the need for direct contact brings forth numerous benefits. A more sustainable environment, increased free time, decreased commuting demands, and the ease of long-distance communication are all significant advantages of this shift.
1344;In the past people wore their traditional clothes, but these days most people wear similar clothes, is this a positive or negative development?;In the past, people wore their traditional clothes and followed their culture. These days, most people wear similar clothes and therefore look very similar to one another. Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?Sample EssayThese days, people’s perspectives on the value of clothing are changing, and individuals tend to wear similar clothing compared to people in the past who opted for their traditional clothing. I believe this tendency exerts a positive influence on the society.It is certainly true that there are some drawbacks to this tendency because it may lead to a loss of global diversity. It can be argued those who wear ordinary clothes such as T-shirts and jeans cannot feel a connection to their roots, and they are likely to neglect their culture and the contribution of their ancestors. Therefore, these people may not take pride in their region, and they might migrate to an urban location rather than contribute to the development of their community. Consequently, many ethnic minorities could suffer from depopulation and eventually disappear.However, I believe that there are more positives than negatives in people opting for similar clothes. The first explanation is that individuals can feel a sense of unity with people all over the world even though they have different religions and ways of life. This would motivate people in the world to support one another, instead of thinking that different parts of the world should deal with their own problems when natural disasters and other terrible problems occur in different nations. Furthermore, this tendency is economically profitable. Generally speaking, as ordinary clothes are automatically manufactured, they can be produced faster and more affordably than traditional clothing such as Japanese Kimono, which is hand-crafted.In conclusion, although people today tend to wear similar clothes instead of traditional ones and this trend cause several problems, I believe that the society as a whole can reap more benefits of this tendency.All parts of the task have been covered. The writer presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt with suitable, widely covered and sufficiently supported ideas. The paragraphing is handled appropriately. The range of vocabulary allows the writer to convey the intended meaning. The overall control of grammar and punctuation is fine, with only a few errors mostly related to word choice (hover/tap on corrections in blue for details). Well done! Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;Historically, individuals donned their traditional attire and embraced their cultural heritage. In contrast, contemporary society sees a majority of people dressed in similar styles, resulting in a more homogenized appearance. Do you consider this shift a positive or negative development? **Sample Essay**Nowadays, attitudes towards clothing are evolving, leading people to wear similar outfits, unlike those in the past who proudly wore their traditional garments. I believe this trend offers a positive impact on society.It is undeniable that this shift has some disadvantages, particularly in terms of eroding global diversity. Critics may argue that individuals who gravitate towards casual wear, like T-shirts and jeans, risk disconnecting from their cultural roots and may overlook the significance of their heritage and ancestors' contributions. As a result, they might develop less pride in their regions and opt to move to urban areas rather than investing in their local communities. This pattern could lead to the depopulation of various ethnic minorities, potentially leading to their extinction.However, I contend that the benefits of adopting similar clothing outweigh the downsides. One significant advantage is that it fosters a sense of global unity, allowing people from diverse backgrounds, religions, and lifestyles to connect. This collective spirit might inspire increased global support during crises, such as natural disasters, rather than fostering a mindset where regions are solely responsible for their own challenges.Moreover, this trend has economic benefits. Mass production of casual clothing generally results in lower costs and faster production times compared to traditional garments, like the hand-crafted Japanese Kimono.In conclusion, despite the tendency for people to favor similar attire over traditional outfits—leading to certain challenges—I believe that the overall advantages for society are greater. All aspects of the task have been effectively addressed. The author demonstrates a well-developed stance that covers all parts of the prompt with relevant, thoroughly examined, and adequately supported ideas. The structure of the essay is well-organized, and the vocabulary range effectively communicates the intended meaning. The grammar and punctuation are largely accurate, with only minor errors primarily associated with word choice. Overall, this essay appears to merit an IELTS Band 8.
641;"Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference. To what extent do you agree or disagree?";There is no doubt these days that the action of the individual is not powerful enough to make the environment better. Unless through laws created by the government and activities have been taken by companies that have a high impact. I strongly disagree with this idea. because there are other ways to help the government as an individual.In essay will prove my point with reasons and examples.Nowadays, people can use social media as a platform that has the power to tell people around the world how to behave. Therefore, an individual has the power to convince others to give higher attention to our environment and create a community that has specific goals to improve. For example, social media influencers could educate the volunteer and work with the youth to make the environment better. For instance, show the young people how to sort the waste and how dangerous the impact is if they do not act in such as way.Moreover, as individuals, people can start doing many actions which benefit the environment by themselves without obstructions. On the other hand, the government and companies should be aware too. For example, while the companies use the factories the government must be monitoring the discharge of fule.In conclusion, after carefully explaining my points of view, in my opinion, it is not necessary to wait for the government and the big companies to act activity for the environment because we as individuals can create and provide educational activities for the public to preserve the environment for the next generation.;There is no doubt that individual actions alone may not be sufficient to improve the environment significantly. Significant changes often require government legislation and the proactive measures of influential companies. However, I strongly believe that individuals can still play a crucial role in supporting environmental initiatives. This essay will illustrate my perspective with reasons and examples.Today, social media serves as a powerful platform for individuals to influence global behavior. People can harness this medium to raise awareness about environmental issues and foster communities with specific sustainability goals. For instance, social media influencers can educate their followers and engage young people in volunteer activities aimed at environmental improvement. They can demonstrate how to properly sort waste and stress the dangers of inaction.Furthermore, individuals can independently take numerous actions that benefit the environment without any obstacles. While government and corporate responsibility is essential, grassroots efforts can also make a difference. For example, companies using factories should be held accountable, and governments must monitor pollution levels to ensure compliance.In conclusion, after outlining my viewpoints, I firmly believe that we should not solely rely on governments and large corporations to take action for the environment. As individuals, we can initiate and lead educational efforts to raise public awareness and work towards preserving the environment for future generations.
1237;"Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.";"Pollution free environment is important for our life's health and even enjoyement.Everyone whether an individual or large entitiy has an impact on the environment; regardless whether it was good or bad. Hence, I believe it is the responsibility of individulas as well as governments and large companies.Individuals can do a lot to improve the environemt around them starting with taking some actions to make a difference. For example, every memeber in the sociaty can support recycling efforts by sorting their garbages into different categoreis, instead of wasting the efforts of recycling companies to do so. Another exmaple would be to stop using plastic products and replace them with more environemt friendly products like pepar products.Moreover, teaching and spreading awarness about the importance of keeping our environemt clean are another way to make a difference. For instance, we can use social media to spread awarness and start campaigns about enviorment and pollution. Furthermore, we can teach some classes in schools and universities about this subject. As a result, this will help the upcoming generations to understand the problem and have them continue the efforts of improvement.While individuals efforts are essential, they must be supported by governments and large companies in order to complete the circle. A main example here would be establishing regulations and laws that would minimze the damage to the environment and maintain pollution at low levels, which is the role of the governments around the world. As for large companies, they can support by adopting the best practicies and take the proper actions to reduce pollution and improve the environment. As an example, they can start using clean and renewable energies to power their facilities and plants. In addition, those companies can develop technologies that contributes toward keeping the environment safe, and prompet the use of clean energy and vehicales.To sum up, the responsibility to improve the environemt must be divided between all three parties individuals, governments, and large companies. Each has his role to enhnace the environemnt and reduce the pollution. They complete each other and they should work together toward a better future for our world.";"A pollution-free environment is crucial for our health and overall enjoyment of life. Every person, whether an individual or part of a large organization, influences the environment, whether positively or negatively. Therefore, it is essential that both individuals and governments, along with large corporations, take responsibility for their impact.Individuals can make significant contributions to improving their surroundings by taking proactive steps. For instance, everyone in society can enhance recycling efforts by properly sorting their waste into different categories, rather than leaving it all to recycling companies. Additionally, reducing the use of plastic products and opting for more eco-friendly alternatives, such as paper products, can make a substantial difference.Furthermore, educating others and raising awareness about the importance of maintaining a clean environment is another effective way to create positive change. We can utilize social media to promote awareness and initiate campaigns focused on environmental issues and pollution. Additionally, incorporating environmental education into school and university curriculums can help future generations understand these challenges and carry on the efforts for improvement.While individual actions are vital, they need to be supported by governments and large companies to be truly effective. One key role of governments worldwide is to establish regulations and laws that minimize environmental harm and keep pollution levels low. Large companies also have a role to play; they can adopt best practices and take meaningful steps to reduce their environmental footprint. For example, transitioning to clean and renewable energy sources to power their facilities and investing in technologies that promote sustainability can greatly contribute to environmental preservation.In conclusion, the responsibility for improving the environment should be shared among individuals, governments, and large corporations. Each group has a specific role in enhancing the environment and reducing pollution. Their efforts are interconnected, and collaboration is essential for creating a healthier and more sustainable future for our planet."
1301;It is a fact that the majority of people who are sent to prison commit further crime after their release.What is causing this? What can be done to change this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is a sad fact that criminals who leave prison go on to commit further crime. There are various reasons for this, but there are also some things that can be done to prevent it from happening.One reason for this recidivism is due to a lack of legitimate income. Many people turn to crime as they cannot find an alternative to earn money. When such person comes out of prison, it is very often the case that they have the same few opportunities for a legitimate income. In fact, these opportunities will even be reduced, as employers are often less willing to give an ex-prisoner a job. Some people also return to crime, as they spend all the time of their prison sentence with other criminals. This is not a great environment for rehabilitation, and sometimes even a network of contacts can be made to help develop criminal activities on release.One important way to help address this problem is education. Criminals who have turned to illegal activities because of no alternatives to earn a living need to learn a way to earn a wage, such as a trade or vocational skills. Computer skills, for example, are in high demand and someone trained in these could very possibly find work. In addition, governments can offer incentives to employers to attract them to give jobs to newly-released prisoners. This would help people who don’t really want to return to crime achieve a fresh start. As keeping people in prison is an expensive business, governments might find it cheaper to pay these incentives.To sum up, people returning to crime is a tragedy that should be avoided if at all possible in today’s society. Education and incentives can directly address the reasons for it and could make society a happier and safer place.;It is a regrettable reality that many individuals who are released from prison often find themselves returning to criminal behavior. While there are multiple factors contributing to this pattern, there are also effective measures that can be taken to mitigate it. One significant reason for recidivism is the lack of legitimate employment opportunities. Many former inmates resort to crime simply because they struggle to find legal ways to earn a living. Upon release, they frequently face limited job options, which are often further diminished by employers’ reluctance to hire those with criminal records. Additionally, individuals who spent their prison time surrounded by other offenders may not have had the chance for meaningful rehabilitation. Instead, they may develop networks that facilitate continued criminal activities upon their release. To combat this issue, education plays a crucial role. Those who have engaged in illegal activities due to the absence of viable job alternatives need access to training that equips them with marketable skills, such as trade or vocational training. For instance, proficiency in computer skills is highly sought after and could significantly enhance a former inmate's chances of securing a job. Furthermore, governments can implement incentives for employers, encouraging them to hire recently released individuals, which would aid those who genuinely wish to turn their lives around. Investing in these incentives could ultimately prove more cost-effective than the expenses associated with incarceration.In conclusion, the cycle of reoffending is a concerning issue that society must strive to overcome. By prioritizing education and providing incentives, we can directly tackle the root causes of recidivism, fostering a safer and more fulfilling community for everyone.
1336;It is believed that people who read for pleasure develop their imagination more and acquire better language skills compared to people who prefer watching television. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Some people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. Personally, I support this opinion for several reasons, which will be laid out in this essay.As we all know, books use text to convey ideas and quite often there are no images or illustrations to picture the scenes described in the book; therefore, we have to use our own imagination while reading. For example, reading a fantasy novel that contains mythical creatures one would normally see the appearance of those characters in their mind while following the plot. In contrast, movie heroes on a TV screen are usually created for the viewer by directors and producers of the film. Watching TV substitutes the need to develop one’s own imagination because the characters and their surroundings are shown on the screen.Furthermore, it is argued that reading is the best way to expand one’s vocabulary. The reader learns the correct spelling of a word by seeing it printed in a book, and they grasp its meaning from the context, without having to look it up in a dictionary. Not only new words but also numerous sentence structures can be learnt from books. To take advantage of these benefits English teachers in many schools use English novels as teaching materials. Students are asked to read the story and capture the keywords to answer the questions in the exam. In comparison, learning new words while watching a TV show isn’t always easy because the viewer’s attention is drawn to the action on the screen and if there are no subtitles, the spelling of the words is not obvious. All this makes a book a more effective tool for a language learner compared to TV.In conclusion, I believe people who love to read tend to have a more active imagination and advanced linguistic comprehension than those who watch television, since readers are required to imagine the story in the book and learn the meaning of new words from the context.";Many people hold the view that reading significantly improves language skills and creativity, while watching television contributes little to these capabilities. I personally align with this perspective for several reasons, which I will elaborate on in this essay.Firstly, unlike television, books primarily use text to express ideas, often lacking illustrations or images to depict the scenes described. This absence prompts readers to engage their imagination. For instance, while reading a fantasy novel populated by mythical creatures, readers visualize these characters based on their interpretation of the text. In contrast, movie characters are visually presented on screen by directors and producers, which can limit the viewers' imaginative involvement, as they are shown the characters and settings rather than having to create them mentally.Moreover, it is widely recognized that reading is one of the most effective ways to expand one’s vocabulary. Readers become familiar with the correct spellings of words through their printed forms, and they often infer their meanings from the surrounding context, eliminating the need to consult a dictionary. Additionally, books offer exposure to a variety of sentence structures. To harness these advantages, many English teachers incorporate literature into their curriculum, encouraging students to read stories and identify keywords to prepare for exams. In contrast, expanding vocabulary through television can be challenging because viewers are often focused on the visual content. Without subtitles, the spelling of new words becomes less accessible, making books far more effective tools for language learners.In conclusion, I believe that individuals who enjoy reading typically possess a more vivid imagination and greater linguistic skills compared to those who predominantly watch television. This is primarily because readers actively engage in visualizing the narrative and deduce the meanings of new words from the context in which they appear.
753;It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;"Nowadays a lot of primary schools are starting to introduce the teaching of animal care and general agriculture. Many people think that primary children should study and understand how to grow vegetables and keep animals; this essay will discuss why primary school should learn about this two arguments and how the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.It is very important study and understand how to grow vegetables and how to keep animals, especially in a younger age. Most of the kids, that frequent the primary school, have this desire of having a pet and, the opportunity of studying how to take care of it in the school, can make the child more aware of the responsibilities that he will have if, one day, he has to own one of them. At the same time, for a primary children it's also important to understand how vegetables grown and what's the process behind that , learning about this arguments will help the kids to appreciate more the food and, as a consequence, in the future there will be less waste of it .It's clear that the advantages will be more than the disadvantages, if there are any. If every kid will know more about the arguments, the world in the future will become a better place, with more respect for the animals and more appreciation for the vegetables that, will also help people to make a healthier life.In conclusion, this essay discussed on how the introduction of subjects like animal care and general understanding of how vegetables grow, will help the kids to become better adults in the future to make of this world a better place.";In recent years, an increasing number of primary schools have begun to incorporate the teaching of animal care and general agriculture into their curriculums. Many people believe that it is essential for young children to learn about growing vegetables and caring for animals. This essay will explore the importance of these subjects and argue that the benefits of introducing them in primary schools far outweigh any potential drawbacks.Understanding how to grow vegetables and care for animals is particularly crucial at a young age. Many primary school students have a natural desire to have pets, and learning how to take care of them in a school setting can help children become aware of the responsibilities involved in pet ownership if they decide to have one in the future. Additionally, it is important for young children to grasp how vegetables are cultivated and the processes involved. This knowledge fosters a greater appreciation for food, which can lead to reduced waste in the future.It is evident that the advantages of teaching these topics greatly surpass any disadvantages. When children gain a deeper understanding of these subjects, they can contribute to a future that is more compassionate towards animals and more mindful of the food we consume, ultimately promoting healthier lifestyles.In conclusion, this essay has examined how introducing subjects such as animal care and vegetable cultivation in primary schools can help children develop into more responsible adults, thereby making the world a better place.
1296;It is the responsibility of individuals to save and provide for their own retirement. Governments have no obligation to provide this benefit.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The responsibility for providing funds for retirement is incredibly important and something that is often overlooked by younger people. Some believe it is the responsibility of the individual to plan for this, but others feel it is the responsibility of the state.People who believe that the state should be responsible for funding retirees, base their argument on the fact that in most countries, people pay taxes and social charges to the government. This money, they argue, should also go towards the provision of a pension for the person paying the tax. In addition, those who have very small or no income, pay little or no tax and do not have the ability to provide for themselves. The government, therefore, in its role of caring for the population, has an obligation to pay a pension and provide other social benefits, such as medical treatment.Many others, however, feel that it is the responsibility of individuals to fund their own retirements. As adults, they argue, people should be able to set aside and invest money throughout their lifetime, so that they can retire with few financial worries. In many countries the government has legislated a framework allowing and encouraging citizens to save up and accumulate sufficient funds for the period after their working years have ended.I neither agree nor disagree with the statement, but rather my opinion takes in parts of both arguments. I feel that people should be responsible for saving money to fund their retirement, but I also feel that individuals who have not had the chance to do so should be supported by the government out of taxes. In my view, therefore, it is wrong to say that governments have no obligation to help people in this area. Governments are there to support the entire population of their countries, which includes the poorer elements of society.;The responsibility of securing retirement funding is a crucial issue that often goes unnoticed by younger generations. While some argue that individuals should take personal initiative in planning for their retirement, others contend that the state has a role in this process. Advocates for state responsibility argue that taxpayers contribute to government funds, and therefore, this money should help provide pensions for those who have paid into the system. They also emphasize that individuals with little or no income are often unable to save for retirement and advocate that the government has a duty to offer pensions and other social benefits, such as healthcare, to support these vulnerable populations.Conversely, many believe that it is up to individuals to ensure their own financial security in retirement. They argue that as adults, people should proactively save and invest throughout their lives to enjoy financial stability during retirement. In several countries, governments have established frameworks aimed at encouraging citizens to save adequately for their post-working years.Personally, I find merit in both viewpoints. I believe individuals should take responsibility for saving for their retirement, yet I also think that the government should provide support for those who have not had the opportunity to do so. Therefore, I contend that it is incorrect to claim that governments bear no obligation to assist in this area. It is the responsibility of governments to support the entire population, including those who are less fortunate.
1287;It must be a woman who stays at home to care for children. Men are not suited to this kind of work. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Traditionally in many parts of the world, it has been women who have stayed at home to care for children. This has led to the ideology and expectation that women are more suited to this type of work than men.The overwhelming status quo where women stay at home to care for the children probably derives from the fact that women are the ones who have to actually give birth to children and, following that, they are the ones who for the early part of a child’s life have to feed the child until it is weaned. In times past, this state of affairs probably led to the women assuming the permanent role of carer for the home and children, whilst men went out to work, whether it was to gather food or work in fields or factories.In spite of the fact that this became what was expected in family dynamics, it does not mean that men are necessarily less suited to caring for a child than women. It is very possible for men to care for a child, even from birth onwards in today’s world. Babies’ milk formula can be mixed by anyone and fed to a child. The fact that many women today choose not to do this again does not mean that they are better suited by nature to care for the child.Suitability for childcare is a matter for individual temperament and aptitude. Not many people, whether they are men or women, feel totally confident and knowledgeable about how to care for a baby or young child at the start. They need advice from their own mothers and fathers, midwives or from books. It is only from experience that skill with childcare comes and this skill can be acquired regardless of gender.All in all, I do not agree with the statement that men are less suited to childcare than women. I believe that aptitude to look after children is a matter of individual temperament, not gender-specific inherited qualities.;"Historically, in many cultures around the globe, women have primarily taken on the role of caregivers for children at home. This has contributed to a prevailing belief that women are inherently more suitable for such responsibilities than men. The established norm of women tending to household duties and child-rearing is likely rooted in biological factors; women are the ones who physically bear children and are responsible for their feeding during the initial stages of life until weaning. In the past, this often resulted in women assuming the permanent position of caregivers, while men focused on working outside the home, whether it involved hunting, farming, or factory work.However, just because this has been the standard in family dynamics does not imply that men are inherently less capable of caring for children. In today's world, men can absolutely participate in child-rearing from birth onward. Infant formula can be prepared and fed by anyone, and the choice of many women to refrain from this role does not suggest that they possess a natural superiority in child care.The ability to care for children depends more on individual temperament and skills rather than gender. Many individuals, regardless of whether they are men or women, might feel uncertain or inexperienced when it comes to caring for infants or young children at first. They often require guidance from parents, midwives, or literature. Developing proficiency in childcare comes with experience and can be achieved by anyone, irrespective of their gender.In summary, I disagree with the notion that men are inherently less suited to childcare than women. I believe that the ability to nurture and care for children is determined by personal temperament and acquired skills, not by biologically inherited traits associated with gender."

1420;Learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Evaluation of the importance of timing is essential, past to show the importance of their present, while that to even remember their past because it would not help them at all. It is a very controversial and complicated matter., many people believe this statement, for many reasons. Firstly, all of us had made many mistakes which we would not like to remember, they will affect their present because they can create some problems with our families example. Secondly, instead of remembering those past trials, one should get the benefits of their present.Regardless of what I said previously, many people are sticking to their past to give themselves a push in their present. It can give a way of learning from mistakes, and a good chance to try to avoid anything that once lead to a past failure.Moreover, success will not come without failure, everybody should make an attempt, even if it fails, and it may become a big success if they try it again and again. In addition, our past is our culture and heritage which we should not forget at all, it is a matter of value to our present and future, and will remain such till the day will die.To sum up, in my opinion, we can not live without a past, it is our value of life. it can help create your experiences and solve your problems better in the future.;"Assessing the significance of timing is crucial, as our past shapes our present, while dwelling on it excessively may be unhelpful. This topic is quite complex and controversial, with many people holding differing views. One reason for this is that we all have made mistakes that we might prefer to forget, as they can negatively impact our current relationships and situations. Instead of focusing on past failures, it is more beneficial to embrace the opportunities of the present.Nonetheless, some individuals cling to their past experiences as a source of motivation for the present. Reflecting on past mistakes can offer valuable lessons and help avoid repeating the same errors. Additionally, achieving success often requires overcoming failures; everyone should take risks, as repeated attempts can eventually lead to significant accomplishments.Furthermore, our past is an integral part of our culture and heritage, deserving to be remembered and valued. It is essential for shaping our present and future, and its significance endures throughout our lives.In conclusion, I believe that our past is indispensable; it enriches our life experiences and equips us to tackle future challenges more effectively."
1197;Learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Learning about the past may provide advantages and disadvantages, depending on the position we are situate ourselves in life ;Undoubtedly, it has great advantages for the ones who need to progress in life, despite what they had been through, because to my opinion, greatest lessons in life come with our own experiences. Advantages of learning about the past are also on the side of the ones who personally know themselves very well and stay honest to themselves at all times.For example, someone who try to be someone, acting to please influent people or trying to get somewhere he or she would not be able to if he were playing real, could be embarrassed by their own mistakes or feeling humiliated when looking back to what he accomplished to get where he/she is now ; therefore the past in this situation would not be a great option for him to look back after.Despite this kind of personality, there are lots of people who find out constructive knowledge in looking back to the past, regardless of how great or bad it could be.The kind of people who actually face their own past and do not try to hide it are the ones who are not scared of how people will judge them, but are willing to make greate changes in their future.It is ,to me, the definition of true progress; how could we learn from our own experiences if we are not willing to face ourselves ?Past can be hurtful but I do think that everything we have been through is a constructive lesson for today and tomorrow.";"Studying the past can have both advantages and disadvantages, depending on our current circumstances. For those striving for personal growth despite their history, the benefits are undeniable. In my view, some of life's most valuable lessons stem from our own experiences. Individuals who possess a deep self-awareness and remain true to themselves can also benefit significantly from understanding their past.Consider someone who insincerely tries to impress influential figures or seeks paths that don’t align with their authentic self. This person may later feel embarrassed by their past choices or humiliated when reflecting on the lengths they went to achieve their current status. For someone in this situation, analyzing their past may not seem advantageous.However, many people find constructive insights in revisiting their past, regardless of whether those memories are positive or negative. Those who confront their history without fear of judgment are often the ones prepared to make meaningful changes for the future. To me, this is the essence of true progress; learning from our experiences requires the courage to face our own realities.While revisiting the past can be painful, I believe that everything we endure serves as a valuable lesson for our present and future."
1375;Many believe that international tourism is bad for their country (reasons and solutions);Many people believe that international tourism is a bad thing for their countries. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to change this negative attitude towards international tourism?Many individuals think that foreign tourism brings negative effects to their countries. There are several reasons for such negative attitude towards international travelers. However, a couple of solutions could be adopted to handle this situation, as will now be discussed.International tourists are often criticized for their contribution to the environmental degradation. It has continuously been noticed that they throw rubbish in their surroundings irresponsibly, which increases the amount of litter everywhere, despite all attempts to reduce waste produced by the local community. This contributes to water, air and soil contamination.Furthermore, foreign tourism has a harmful influence on traditional customs and indigenous practices of host countries because many tourists are careless and insensitive the emotions and feelings of local residents. For instance, in India, some foreign travelers wear inappropriate clothes or expose too much of skin when they visit sacred places, which leads to some negative attitude and the local public.However, this situation can be improved different solutions which could be handled by the government. The government should explain the benefits of international tourism which contributes to the development of local . They not only spend money in shops and restaurants but also create jobs in service industries, and this aspect could be publicized. Additionally, the government should increase the awareness among the foreigners through different media such as roadside billboards and advertisements, and tourists should be encouraged to get rid of rubbish correctly.In conclusion, the inhospitable feeling that the local people have for international tourists can be explained in many ways. However, in my opinion, the government’s involvement is essential to change the negative attitude by citing various advantages of international tourism to their country and raising awareness among tourists in order to protect local habitats.This essay covers the entire task topic by exploring both reasons for negative attitude towards international tourism and some possible actions to change it. The writer explains why locals may resent international tourists and suggests what steps can be taken to transform the way people feel about foreigners in their country. The information is well-organised by the use of paragraphing, and the writer moves from one idea to the next effortlessly, with the help of linking words. A wide range of vocabulary is used, including less common words such as “degradation”,”inhospitable”, “habitat”, “awareness” and “sacred”. Instances of inaccurate word choice are rare, and even these slips don’t cause difficulty for the reader. Overall, this looks like a Band 8 essay.;Many individuals hold the view that international tourism negatively impacts their countries. What are the underlying reasons for this perspective? What measures can be taken to shift this unfavorable attitude toward foreign travelers?There are several contributing factors to the negative sentiment regarding international tourism. However, a few strategies could be implemented to address this issue, as will be explored below.One major concern is the environmental harm caused by tourists. Many international visitors are often perceived as careless, leaving litter behind and exacerbating the pollution problem despite local efforts to maintain cleanliness. This behavior leads to increased contamination of air, water, and soil.Additionally, foreign tourism tends to affect the traditional customs and cultural practices of host communities. Tourists sometimes disregard local customs and the sentiments of residents. For instance, in India, inappropriate attire worn by some travelers at sacred sites can provoke negative reactions from the local populace.Nevertheless, this situation can be remedied through various governmental interventions. Authorities should highlight the advantages of international tourism, which plays a crucial role in local economic development. Tourists contribute to the economy by patronizing shops and restaurants, and they help create jobs in the service sector, making this aspect worthy of promotion. Furthermore, governments should raise awareness among visitors through channels such as billboards and advertisements, encouraging them to dispose of waste responsibly.In conclusion, the negative attitudes that locals may harbor toward international tourists can be attributed to multiple factors. However, I believe that government action is vital in altering this perception by showcasing the benefits of international tourism and educating tourists on how to respect local environments.This essay addresses the topic by examining both the reasons for negative perceptions of international tourism and potential solutions to improve the situation. The writer articulates the concerns locals may have about foreign visitors and proposes steps to change public sentiment. The structure is clear, with effective transitions between ideas, and a diverse vocabulary is employed, including terms such as “environmental harm,” “customs,” “benefits,” and “responsibly.” Instances of incorrect word usage are minimal and do not hinder comprehension. Overall, this essay meets the criteria for a Band 8.
1297;Many cities have areas where the only cars are taxis and buses.Is this a positive or a negative development? What are the effects of this on individuals and society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Banning cars from the centre of various cities around the world has been a strategy to reduce pollution and encourage people to use public transport. It has had various positive effects for both individuals and for society as a whole.Banning cars from the centre of cities seems to be a very positive development. Fewer cars on the road means less pollution and fewer fossil fuel resources being used up. Although the effect on resources might be relatively negligible, it can create a newer way of thinking regarding the dynamics of transport within cities and this could be the most important benefit to society. Some people working in the centre of these cities may complain about inconvenience, but many would agree that this is a small price to pay.A reduction in the reliance of people on private vehicles is likely to encourage them to use public transport or even bicycles. Using public transport, especially the types that run on clean sources of power, will significantly raise air quality levels in cities, which will of course benefit everyone. The clean air could even further encourage the use of bicycles, which would in turn promote more healthy lifestyles and less obesity. This would contribute on an individual level to people’s well-being and a better and longer life, and on a societal level, it would lessen the strain on public health resources. Governments could encourage this by creating more bicycle lanes to make cycling easier and safer.In conclusion, it is clear that banning cars from the centre of cities is significantly beneficial. Better health and ecology, as well as improvement in longevity and well-being can benefit individuals and the entire society.;Implementing car bans in the central areas of cities worldwide has emerged as an effective approach to combat pollution and promote public transportation usage. This strategy has yielded several positive outcomes for both individuals and society at large. The decision to restrict cars in urban centers appears to be a highly advantageous move. With fewer vehicles on the road, there is reduced pollution and a decrease in the consumption of fossil fuel resources. While the impact on resource conservation may be modest, it fosters a new perspective on urban transportation dynamics, which could be the most significant societal benefit.Though some individuals working in city centers may express concerns about inconvenience, many would likely agree that this is a minor sacrifice. Diminishing dependence on personal vehicles is likely to inspire greater use of public transportation and bicycles. Utilizing public transit, especially modes powered by clean energy, can markedly improve air quality in urban environments, benefiting all residents. Increased clean air may further encourage cycling, leading to healthier lifestyles and reduced obesity rates. This shift would not only enhance individual well-being and longevity but also alleviate pressure on public health systems.Governments can facilitate this transition by expanding bicycle infrastructure to make cycling safer and more accessible. In summary, it is evident that banning cars from city centers offers substantial advantages. Enhanced health, improved ecological conditions, and increased longevity stand to benefit both individuals and society as a whole.
1332;Many countries are experiencing population growth and need to build more homes. Some say that new homes should be constructed in existing cities while others argue that new towns should be built to accommodate the growing population. What are the advantages and disadvantages of these points of view?;In the past two decades, there has been an exponential increase in the migration of people to different cities and countries, indirectly resulting in a considerable infrastructure development. However, there has been a long-standing debate on whether to direct these infrastructure projects to current cities or establish new counties. Careful consideration of both alternatives reveals that each has its positives and negatives.One of the major advantages of focusing on current cities for new construction is that it would benefit the residents of the cities in multiple ways. Tenants living in Vancouver would prefer to buy a newly constructed house in the city where they work rather than in a new town, to reduce their commute time. Moreover, the city has everything they desire such as efficient public transport, thriving job market and affordable healthcare. This would not be possible in new towns because of the time it takes to establish services and generate opportunities for people.On the other hand, accommodating people in houses built in newly created towns would put them in a pollution-free and clean environment. This is because new towns may take at least 10 years of time to become an attractive spot for people and industries alike. As a result, their exposure to harmful emissions from industrial plants and transportation is reduced, shielding them from the risks of acquiring health complications. A recent report released by the word Health Organization (WHO) suggests that the number of people affected by airborne infections is 20% higher in cities compared to new towns that were formed just a couple of years ago.In conclusion, while there are both positive and negative aspects to these views, the decision on where to build the new homes to accommodate increasing population will depend on many other factors as well. Therefore, a thorough assessment is required before starting an infrastructure project.;Over the last twenty years, there has been a significant surge in the migration of individuals to various cities and countries, leading to extensive infrastructure development. This growth has sparked an ongoing debate about whether to target infrastructure investments in existing cities or to create new towns. A careful analysis of both options reveals distinct advantages and disadvantages.One of the primary benefits of focusing new construction on established cities is the direct positive impact on local residents. For instance, individuals living in Vancouver may prefer purchasing newly-built homes within the city where they work, rather than relocating to a newly developed area, as this choice helps to minimize their commute time. Additionally, established cities offer essential amenities such as efficient public transportation, vibrant job markets, and accessible healthcare services—features that may take significant time to develop in new towns.Conversely, constructing homes in newly established towns could provide residents with a cleaner, pollution-free environment. It typically takes at least ten years for these new areas to develop into appealing locations for both people and businesses. Consequently, living in these areas can reduce individuals' exposure to harmful emissions from industrial activities and transportation, thereby diminishing their risk of health issues. A recent report from the World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that the incidence of airborne infections is 20% higher in cities compared to relatively newer towns.In conclusion, while there are merits and drawbacks to both approaches, the decision on where to build new residences to accommodate the growing population will hinge on various additional factors. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation is essential prior to initiating any infrastructure projects.
1327;Many people argue that museums and art galleries should present the nation’s art, as opposed to artworks from other countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The cultural value of engaging with museums and art galleries is unquestionable; they exert a great deal of influence on our perception of the world. It is only reasonable to ponder whether or not these outlets of culture should concentrate their efforts on presenting the nation’s own art, and not that of other countries. In my opinion, there should be an attempt to strike a balance and put the objects of national art in the spotlight, while allowing the public to get acquainted with foreign artworks to a certain extent.If people were to only find sculptures and paintings by national artists in their local museums, that would have a number of positive effects, such as the fame the artists of that country would gain and the pride its citizens would feel for their fellow countrymen. It would promote patriotism and strengthen the image of the country in the eyes of its inhabitants. Local artists would also receive more financial assistance from the government as their works would generate a significant amount of interest, potentially resulting in further development of the local art. However, in order to evolve art needs fresh ideas, and without exposure to a wider range of creativity the world provides, the evolution of local arts may be hindered.People enjoy art because it appeals to their inner sense of beauty and triggers strong emotions, and whether the masterpiece that causes these feelings belongs to a local or foreign artist is irrelevant. Talent knows no geographical boundaries; therefore, the emphasis should be on how much joy or amazement the work of art brings, rather than on its origin. If that principle were to be followed, we would never have to choose between local and international art. Reducing our museums or galleries’ collections to local art works, in my view, would be harmful and go against the democratic nature of art.To sum up, it seems to me that a country has nothing to lose by allowing its people to admire art created elsewhere in the world. A conscious choice by the government to support local artists while hosting exhibitions from other countries could prove the most beneficial.";"The cultural significance of museums and art galleries is undeniable; they have a profound impact on how we view the world. It raises the question of whether these cultural institutions should primarily focus on showcasing national art instead of that from abroad. I believe there should be a balance: while promoting national art, it’s also important to introduce the public to international works.If local museums featured only sculptures and paintings by domestic artists, it could yield several positive outcomes. National artists would gain recognition, and citizens could take pride in their achievements, fostering patriotism and enhancing the country’s image. Additionally, increased interest in local art might lead to greater financial support for artists, further stimulating the growth of the art scene. However, art requires innovation, and limiting exposure to a broader range of creativity could stifle local artistic development. People are drawn to art for its beauty and the emotions it evokes, regardless of whether the creator is local or foreign. Talent transcends borders, so the focus should be on the enjoyment and inspiration a piece of art provides, rather than its origin. By adopting this mindset, we wouldn't have to choose between local and international art. Restricting collections to only local works would, in my opinion, be detrimental and contrary to the democratic essence of art.In conclusion, I believe a country stands to gain from exposing its citizens to art from around the globe. A deliberate effort by the government to support local artists while also featuring international exhibitions could be the most advantageous approach."
955;Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?;Numerous experts think that every country should be capable to produce more materials and commodities. I agree with this argument as it brings benefits to countries and I will highlight some of them.To begin with, manufacturing goods is essential to any country as it helps to build their economy. Increasing production power assist them to export more and it also makes them less dependent on other countries. For instance, China is one of the largest producers in the world in any goods which also makes them the largest exporter. Such development in production power contributes to their gross domestic product.Another reason is that extra produced goods can be used in emergencies, such emergencies are pandemics, financial crises and many more. By growing the production of goods and materials, a country will always be a reliable business partner. Thus, companies will reach out to them and become loyal partners. Moreover, countries should be aware that by increasing their production. For example, there is a semiconductor chip crisis is going on all over the world and no country in the world is able to meet the demands of chips. On the contrary, India is now planning to satisfy the demand for chips by strengthening its manufacturing capacity to a massive level while it will directly contribute to their economy and also generate job opportunities.To conclude, I agree that more in-house production is necessary. It is extremely crucial to produce more needed products in order to consistently outperform the rest of the world and also it brings many beneficial things like generating job opportunities and a rise in the Gross domestic product of a country.;"Many experts believe that every country should enhance its ability to produce more goods and materials. I support this viewpoint, as it offers significant advantages to nations, which I will outline below.Firstly, manufacturing is crucial for any country, as it helps strengthen the economy. By boosting production capabilities, countries can increase exports and reduce reliance on imports. For instance, China stands as one of the world’s largest producers, making it the top exporter as well. This growth in production capacity positively impacts their gross domestic product.Additionally, having a surplus of goods can be invaluable during emergencies, such as pandemics or financial crises. By ramping up the production of essential items, a country becomes a reliable business partner, attracting companies that seek stable and trustworthy relationships. Moreover, nations should recognize the importance of enhancing their production capabilities. Take the ongoing semiconductor chip crisis, for example; no nation is currently able to meet the global demand for chips. In contrast, India is aiming to address this shortage by significantly bolstering its manufacturing capacity, which will not only support its economy but also create job opportunities.In conclusion, I firmly believe that increasing domestic production is essential. It plays a vital role in enabling countries to stay competitive on the global stage while also generating job opportunities and contributing to higher gross domestic product."
1367;Many people believe that reducing speed limits is the best option for road safety improvement (agree/disagree);"Many people believe that reducing speed limits is the best option for road safety improvement. Do you think there are other measures that could be put in place? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?One of the most conspicuous trends of today’s world is a colossal surge in the number of vehicle accidents cars, trucks and buses, all over the , be it in impoverished or developed nations. There is a wide range of factors that . In my opinion, this situation could be remedied, provided some effective measures are taken.Measures to deal with this soaring concern are many; the most significant are not remote or complicated but accessible and practicable. The primary one lies in the fact that governments should take a firm stance and apply stringent rules and regulations to lower the speed limit. Secondly, using electronic devices while driving should be forbidden by law. Finally, an awareness program could be initiated by individuals to educate the public about the catastrophic effects of unsafe roads and the projected enhancements for road safety. Only when convergent efforts from all sectors are ensured, can we expect to see considerable progress in tackling this problem.There is a deluge of merits for implementation of reduced speed limits. High speed is likely to impose life threatening danger on people crossing the roads, due to the perilous nature of this hazardous speed with danger being an integral part of it. Not only does reducing the speed limits contribute to decreasing daily accidents, but it also raises the standard of driving. Needless to say, all these advantages have a far-reaching impact on pedestrian safety.There are, however, some pitfalls that can easily overpower the potential benefits of limiting speed. The primary one stems from the fact that slowing the speed could lead to augmenting the daily traffic hours. Besides, it could also delay delivering sick and patients to hospitals. Hence, it is apparent why some individuals are against changing the standardized level of speed.From what has been discussed, one can conclude that despite the drawbacks of reducing speed limits, the expected benefits of this measure are indeed far greater.All the parts of the task have been covered fairly well. The response presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt with suitable, widely covered and thoroughly supported ideas. The range of vocabulary is adequate for the requirements of task response. There are some mistakes in word choice and grammar. Nevertheless, the essay is up to the mark and is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.";Many people argue that lowering speed limits is the most effective strategy for enhancing road safety. However, do you believe there are alternative measures that could be implemented? What are the pros and cons of such approaches? A significant trend in today's society is the dramatic increase in vehicle accidents involving cars, trucks, and buses, regardless of whether the country is developed or struggling economically. Numerous factors contribute to this crisis. I believe that this issue can be addressed if appropriate measures are taken.There are various strategies available to tackle this pressing concern, many of which are straightforward and feasible. The most important step is for governments to adopt a firm approach by enforcing strict regulations to reduce speed limits. Additionally, legislation should prohibit the use of electronic devices while driving. Finally, public awareness campaigns could be launched to educate individuals on the severe consequences of unsafe driving and the potential improvements in road safety. Only through collaborative efforts across all sectors can we hope to see meaningful progress in addressing this challenge.Implementing reduced speed limits offers numerous advantages. Higher speeds pose a direct threat to pedestrians, as they significantly increase the danger of accidents. By lowering speed limits, we can decrease the frequency of accidents and elevate overall driving standards. Clearly, these benefits have a profoundly positive effect on pedestrian safety.However, there are drawbacks that could overshadow the potential advantages of speed reduction. The most notable concern is that lowering speed limits may lead to longer traffic congestion. This could also delay the transportation of sick individuals to medical facilities. This explains why some people oppose altering established speed limits.In conclusion, despite the potential disadvantages associated with reduced speed limits, the anticipated benefits of this measure far outweigh them. Overall, the response effectively addresses all aspects of the prompt, presenting a well-developed argument supported by relevant ideas.

1290;Many people believe that studying at university is the best way to develop oneself, learn new skills and find a well-paid job. Other people believe that more is learned from getting a job straight away after school and learning whilst working.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;There are many ways to learn new knowledge and skills. Traditional educational routes, such as school followed by college or university is one route that is generally accepted and respected by today’s society. It can be argued, however, that this is not always the best way. A more vocational route can be more appropriate for certain people and for particular jobs.Universities generally have deference given to them and, due to this, most schools tailor their programs to help students get university admission. Universities usually have respected and highly qualified teachers who have the knowledge and the skills to take their students to very high levels of knowledge and expertise. The very difficulty of gaining admission, getting through the duration of the course and passing final exams ensures to employers that graduates have the necessary self-discipline, intelligence and ability to get through the courses.Universities are also particularly well suited to the teaching of various subjects, for example, medicine, law and literature and these subjects need students’ full-time attention in order to do well. Although vocational experience is necessary, a certain grounding in basic concepts to a high-level is important. Once this knowledge has been acquired, students can then integrate their knowledge with practical understanding.This, however, is not the case for all areas of learning, especially ones where the quantity of high level knowledge is not required or is possible to be learned whilst working at the same time. Young people studying to be an electrician or a plumber are good examples. To do this work well requires a lot of experience, yet also a sound understanding of theory. The learning here can be and is done working and studying at the same time, often through apprenticeships and vocational courses involving significant amounts of work experience.Therefore, in my opinion, there are more ways than one to acquire a profession. Whether learning should take place at university alone or whilst working depends on the course and the end job.;"There are numerous avenues for acquiring new knowledge and skills. A conventional path, such as attending school followed by college or university, is widely recognized and esteemed in today’s society. However, it can be argued that this may not always be the most effective approach. For some individuals and specific professions, a more vocational pathway may be more suitable.Universities typically command a high level of respect, and as a result, many schools tailor their curricula to facilitate students’ admission to these institutions. Universities often employ well-regarded, highly qualified instructors who possess the expertise to guide students toward achieving advanced levels of knowledge and competence. The rigorous process of gaining admission, completing the coursework, and passing final exams assures employers that graduates demonstrate the requisite self-discipline, intelligence, and capability to succeed in their studies.Furthermore, universities are particularly adept at teaching specialized subjects like medicine, law, and literature, which demand students' full-time commitment for optimal success. While practical experience is crucial, establishing a solid foundation in key concepts at an advanced level is equally important. Once students acquire this knowledge, they can blend theoretical understanding with hands-on experience.However, this model does not apply universally to all fields of study, especially in areas where extensive high-level knowledge is unnecessary or can be acquired concurrently with work. Professions such as electricians or plumbers exemplify this point; excelling in these roles necessitates substantial hands-on experience and a solid grasp of theory. In these cases, learning often occurs simultaneously through apprenticeships and vocational programs that supply ample work experience.In conclusion, I believe there are multiple pathways to professional development. Whether one should pursue education exclusively at a university or while gaining work experience depends on the specific course of study and the desired occupation."
1288;Many people in cities today live in high-rise apartment blocks. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this type of living?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;High-rise apartment blocks are a common sight in cities around the world. They are especially popular in large cities and in locations where building land is scarce. Living in such buildings has various advantages and disadvantages for town planners and the inhabitants themselves.The most significant advantage of high-rise apartment blocks is probably for the town planners. With land often being at a premium in large cities, one way to maximise space is to build upwards, so that the population density per square kilometre can be increased. The demand for housing in big cities can therefore be more easily met. There are also disadvantages for town planners. The heavier population density can put added pressure on social facilities, for example sewage and other waste disposal, and the provision of adequate school and medical services.There are also advantages and disadvantages for the actual inhabitants of high-rise apartment blocks. With the demand for housing being reduced, prices are therefore not as high, making housing more affordable. Many people also like not having to be responsible for a garden, and living in an apartment has this advantage. Finally, with so many people living in the same area, many friendships can be made and a community spirit can be built up. It appears the most significant disadvantage is that, in practice, living in high-rise apartment blocks is just not the lifestyle many people want. In some city neighbourhoods, these living spaces can often be associated with poor living conditions and undesirable social elements. In addition, many people view high-rise apartment blocks as being unsafe. For example, in the case of fire, tall buildings are difficult or impossible to evacuate safely.It is clear that high-rise apartment blocks have benefits and drawbacks. It is also clear, however, that due to the need to house increasing numbers of people in cities, these architectural features are here to stay, whether people like them or not.;"High-rise apartment buildings are a prevalent feature in urban landscapes worldwide, particularly in large cities where land is limited. These structures offer distinct advantages and challenges for both city planners and residents alike.For city planners, the primary benefit of high-rise apartments is the efficient use of space. In densely populated areas, building upwards allows for an increase in population density per square kilometer, making it easier to address the housing demand in bustling metropolitan environments. However, this elevated density also presents challenges, as it can strain existing social services such as waste management, education, and healthcare facilities.Residents of high-rise apartment blocks experience their own set of pros and cons. On the positive side, by increasing the housing supply, prices can remain more affordable, alleviating some financial pressure for inhabitants. Additionally, many people appreciate not having the responsibility of maintaining a garden, a common benefit of apartment living. The close proximity to neighbors can also foster a sense of community and opportunities for friendship.Conversely, a significant drawback for many is that high-rise living does not cater to everyone's lifestyle preferences. In certain urban neighborhoods, these living spaces are often linked to poor living conditions and negative social dynamics. Safety concerns also arise; for instance, evacuating a tall building during a fire can be exceptionally challenging.In summary, while high-rise apartment buildings come with both advantages and disadvantages, the ongoing need to accommodate growing urban populations ensures that these structures will remain a staple of city life, regardless of differing opinions on their impact."
789;Many people now undertake extreme activities, from hang-gliding to mountain climbing.Why do people risk their lives in this way, and do you think this is a good trend?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Extreme sports, such as mountain climbing and hand-gliding, have become increasingly popular over the past several decades. Now more than ever, athletes can be paid to do these activities full-time, encouraging more aspiring athletes to enter extreme sports. In addition, the addictive nature of these activities means that participants tend to stay in the sport for the thrill. While the increased popularity can result in more accidents, it can also make the sports safer as atheletes collectively learn from past mistakes.While people have undertaken extreme activities long before the advent of television and social media, these new platforms give extreme sports the much needed sponsorship and attention. Nowadays, outlandish and dangerous acts can be televised and monetized, giving the athletes a way to make a living out of these events. Therefore, more people would feel encouraged to participate in these activities knowing that they can have a decent income. On top of the external motivation, most extreme athletes take part in these sports because they are thrilling and addicting. These atheletes chase the rush and validation that they get when doing dangerous activities. As a result, even without the external rewards, some people would still partake in these sports.Given that people are motivated both internally and externally to participate in extreme sports, it is inevitable that these activities become more popular. While it is true that increased participation would result in more accidents, it would also create more lessons for future participants. In this way, these accidents and injuries would help educate future athletes on how to protect themselves. Moreoever, this increased popularity would also encourage governments to draft more safety regulations.In conclusion, given that it is human nature to want to achieve feats of strength and courage, extreme sports would always be attractive for some. Because of this, there will always be people injuring themselves while pursuing these feats. Therefore, these activities would become safer the more athletes learn from past incidents.;"Extreme sports, such as mountain climbing and hand-gliding, have gained significant popularity over the last few decades. Today, many athletes can pursue these activities full-time and earn a living from them, which inspires more aspiring participants to explore extreme sports. Additionally, the thrill provided by these activities often leads individuals to remain involved in the sport. While a rise in popularity may lead to more accidents, it can also contribute to improved safety practices as athletes learn from previous experiences. Long before the age of television and social media, people engaged in extreme activities; however, these modern platforms have brought essential sponsorship and visibility to these sports. Now, outrageous and perilous stunts can be broadcasted and monetized, allowing athletes to make a living from their pursuits. As a result, more individuals are motivated to join these activities, encouraged by the prospect of earning a solid income. Beyond external incentives, many extreme athletes participate simply for the exhilarating and addictive nature of the sports, driven by the adrenaline rush and validation that comes from engaging in dangerous challenges. Consequently, even in the absence of financial rewards, many individuals would still be drawn to these activities.With both internal and external motivations fueling interest, it is inevitable that extreme sports will continue to grow in popularity. While a greater number of participants may lead to an increase in accidents, it also creates valuable learning opportunities for those who follow. In this manner, injuries and incidents can serve as educational experiences, helping future athletes understand how to protect themselves better. Furthermore, the rising popularity of extreme sports may prompt governments to implement stricter safety regulations.In summary, the inherent human desire to achieve remarkable feats of strength and courage ensures that extreme sports will always captivate some individuals. As such, there will inevitably be those who suffer injuries while pursuing these challenges. However, as athletes learn from past experiences, these activities will progressively become safer."
1345;Many people support animal testing while others believe it isn’t appropriate (discuss);Many people support use of animals for testing medicines for humans. Others believe it isn’t appropriate to use animals for such experiments. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayApproval of the medicines for human use is a tedious process which involves a series of tests often performed on animals. While some people support this idea because it makes drugs safer for human consumption, others believe that it is an unethical practice. Personally, I am in favour of the idea that medicines should be tested in all possible scenarios before being released to the public.Those against animal experimentation argue that animals have the same rights as human beings because they are the outcome of the same evolution process through which humans came into existence. Infecting them with viruses and exposing them to bacteria, to create a conducive environment to test a chemical substance may cause excruciating pain to these lab animals. Any failed test can mean that the subject either loses its precious life or suffers for the rest of its existence, and understandably, some people are against what they consider an immoral practice.Nonetheless, if a drug is released into the market without a thorough end-to-end testing, it could cause severe damage to anyone who may consume it. Every day a large number of animals are being mercilessly killed by humans for their mere flesh and skin. There isn’t a big difference between killing an animal for food and sacrificing its life for testing a chemical composition, because both actions are helping the human race to survive. What’s more, the life of one animal used to test a life-saving drug could help many people live. This is why a large number of people believe that testing drugs on animals is a matter of survival.To sum up, there are valid reasons why animal testing seems cruel and unacceptable to some, and crucial to others. In my opinion, even though animals subjected to testing may suffer, it is a necessary step to ensure the healing power of a drug.;The use of animals to test medicines intended for human use is a divisive issue. While numerous individuals advocate for animal testing, arguing that it enhances the safety of pharmaceuticals, others view it as an unethical practice. In my view, I believe that thorough testing of medicines is essential before they are approved for public use.Opponents of animal experimentation contend that animals deserve rights similar to those of humans, as they share a common evolutionary lineage. Subjecting animals to experiments that involve infecting them with viruses or exposing them to harmful substances can lead to immense suffering. In cases where tests fail, the animals may either lose their lives or endure prolonged pain, leading many to label such practices as morally objectionable.However, it is important to consider that releasing a drug without comprehensive testing can have catastrophic consequences for human health. Each day, numerous animals are killed for their meat and hides, so the distinction between using an animal for food versus testing might not be as significant. In fact, the life of just one animal in a drug trial could potentially save many human lives, which is why many advocate for animal testing as a necessary practice for the survival of humanity.In conclusion, while some may see animal testing as cruel and unacceptable, others consider it vital for medical advancements. Although animals may experience suffering, I believe that this testing is a critical step in validating the safety and efficacy of drugs.
327;Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. Do you agree or disagree?;It is undeniable that nowadays, smart devices such as phones and tablets play an essential role in one's life. Through countless websites and applications, people can connect with each other without any boundaries. While many people agree that the introduction of these technologies has many disadvantages to the conservative way of starting and maintaining relationships, I personally believe that they rather develop new socializing methods.First and foremost, social medias and applications can help with keeping in touch with acquintances. Previously, people had to follow a precise time and location to meet up with their friends as they are unable to contact the others to reschedule. However, the internet allows them to update their plans at any time. This means that if there is any emergency, an individual can immediately postpone the upcoming event and find the next available slot to continue the plan. Furthermore, there are several applications that allow people to video call their friends and family who are currently living apart.The current technologies not only offer us options to communicate with our current contacts but also allow us to discover new friends. In the past, it is difficult to find people with a common interest which had to be done through social events. Nowadays, online communities enable their users to connect with new friends virtually. Thus, fewer individuals are left alone, especially introverts and those who are living in remote areas which can have difficulties socializing offline.All in all, despite the fact that there are many positive impacts of the invention of social medias and communication technologies, there are also risks and downsides of using them without face-to-face communication. Therefore, the time used for socializing online and offline should always be balanced.;It is undeniable that smart devices like smartphones and tablets play a crucial role in our lives today. With a multitude of websites and applications at our fingertips, people can connect with one another without limitations. While many individuals argue that these technologies have downsides when it comes to traditional methods of forming and maintaining relationships, I believe they actually foster new ways of socializing.Firstly, social media platforms and apps aid in maintaining contact with acquaintances. In the past, people were bound by specific times and places for social gatherings, as they had no means to communicate with others about rescheduling. However, the internet now enables individuals to update their plans at any moment. This flexibility allows someone to quickly postpone an event in case of an emergency and find the next available opportunity to reconnect. Additionally, various applications facilitate video calls with friends and family who may be living far apart.Current technologies not only enhance communication with existing contacts but also provide opportunities to meet new friends. Previously, finding others who shared the same interests often required attending social events. Today, online communities allow users to connect with new acquaintances virtually. As a result, fewer people feel isolated, particularly introverts and those residing in remote areas where offline socializing can be challenging.In conclusion, while the advent of social media and communication technologies brings numerous benefits, there are also potential risks and drawbacks associated with lacking face-to-face interaction. Thus, it is essential to strike a balance between online and offline socializing.
837;Many people today, especially in the developed world, are choosing to have fewer children, or none at all.Why is this happening, and do you think it is a good trend?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Weather to have children or not is one of the most important questions young adults have to ask themselfs nowadays. Overpopulation is one of the many global problems next to climate change, and poverty.In my opinion, the need to have children roots back to us being nothing more, but civilised animals. Animals have one goal above all; reproduce. This is why in many cultures, men and women who cannot have chlidren are seen as disabled, or sick. Nowadays, modern values changed our perspective, having children is often seen as a necessity for a happy, and successful life.It is important to recognise the problems the developed world faces. There is smoke in the air, plastic pollution everywhere, poverty in third world countries, and many other factors that make Earth a terrible place for many. Above all, the life we give birth to will have to eat, drink, and consume just like everyone else, using more and more of the already limited resources, generating more and more trash.Many people argue that the above mentioned points are a pessimistic and unrealistic. Humans have to reproduce, to keep the species from extintion. And truthfully the only way to do that, is to give birth as many kids as possible. This issue lies deep in our society; here in Hungary, a family is rewared almost 30000 USD if they have 3 or more kids. This means that many people have children because they get money for it, and they are also seen socially accepted.I believe modern day intelligence goes further than IQ points and money earned. We have to recognise the problems created, overpopulation being one of them. While I do not believe that we should not have kids, I think there should be careful planning involved and self-reflection before giving birth to new life.";"Deciding whether to have children is one of the most significant dilemmas that young adults face today. Overpopulation, alongside climate change and poverty, is one of the many challenges confronting our world.In my view, the instinct to have children is deeply rooted in our nature as civilized beings. Like all animals, our primary purpose is to reproduce. This is why, in many cultures, individuals unable to have children may be perceived as impaired or unwell. However, contemporary values have shifted our perspective; having children is often regarded as essential for a fulfilling and successful life.It's crucial to acknowledge the challenges faced by the developed world. We are surrounded by air pollution, rampant plastic waste, and persistent poverty in developing countries, among other issues that make Earth a difficult place for many. Importantly, any new life brought into the world will need to consume resources—food, water, and energy—contributing to the strain on our already limited supplies and increasing waste production.Some may argue that these concerns are overly pessimistic and unrealistic. They point out that human reproduction is necessary for the survival of our species, and indeed, the most straightforward way to ensure that survival is to have as many children as possible. This perspective is ingrained in society; for instance, here in Hungary, families receive nearly $30,000 if they have three or more children. Consequently, some individuals may choose to have children primarily for financial incentives and social acceptance.I believe that modern intelligence transcends mere IQ or financial gain. We must address the issues that arise from overpopulation. While I don't advocate for a complete halt to childbearing, I do think it's essential to approach the decision to have children with careful planning and deep self-reflection."
1317;Many people try to achieve a work-life balance but fail. Why is this happening? What can be done to help people overcome this problem?;Many people strive to achieve a work-life balance, but often find themselves failing despite their best efforts. This is not surprising, as balancing work and life commitments can be extremely difficult due to both having their unique stressors.One of the major reasons why so many people struggle to achieve harmony between their personal and professional lives is that now it is easier than ever for people to stay connected outside of regular work hours. This has led to an expectation that employees should always be available, and they risk being seen as unreliable or uncommitted if they are not. A knock-on effect of longer working hours is that little time is left for leisure activities such as socialising or engaging in hobbies or sports, which help reduce stress levels and improve overall well-being. This type of pressure and lack of free time can lead to feelings of burnout, with no respite from life’s pressures, resulting in chronic fatigue and diminished motivation over time.Helping those struggling to find a suitable work-life balance will require joint efforts of managers and employees. Workers, for instance, need to recognise the importance of taking regular breaks throughout the day and getting enough sleep each night, while employers should consider being more flexible when it comes to allowing staff to work remotely and offering paid vacation days. This will give employees space, both mentally and physically, enabling them to better manage their commitments without overextending themselves.In conclusion, achieving a successful work-life balance is something that many cannot quite reach due to external pressures from employers and a lack of downtime. However, these issues can be overcome, if we create realistic boundaries between our professional lives and personal goals, and make conscious decisions about how we want to spend our time.;Many individuals aim to attain a work-life balance, yet frequently find themselves falling short despite their sincere efforts. This is understandable, as juggling work and personal commitments can be quite challenging, with each having its own specific stressors. One significant factor contributing to this struggle is the ease of staying connected beyond regular working hours. This has fostered an expectation that employees should always be accessible, leading to perceptions of unreliability or lack of dedication if they aren’t. The consequence of extended work hours often leaves little opportunity for leisure activities such as socializing, hobbies, or sports, which are essential for alleviating stress and enhancing overall well-being. Such pressure and scarcity of free time can result in burnout, leaving individuals with chronic fatigue and diminished motivation.To assist those struggling with work-life balance, a collaborative effort between managers and employees is essential. Employees, for example, should acknowledge the importance of taking regular breaks and ensuring adequate sleep, while employers might benefit from offering more flexible remote work options and additional paid vacation days. Providing this space—both mental and physical—can help employees better navigate their commitments without feeling overwhelmed.In conclusion, achieving a harmonious work-life balance remains elusive for many due to external pressures from employers and a lack of downtime. However, these challenges can be addressed by establishing realistic boundaries between professional responsibilities and personal pursuits, as well as making intentional choices about how to allocate our time.
1298;Many schoolchildren today take part in work experience sessions for short periods of time instead of attending school. Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It has been a popular trend for some time now to put children into what can be called ‘work experience placements’. The children are taken out of school and take part in various types of work, usually for around a week. Some people criticise this trend, but I can’t see how it can be a negative experience.One of the criticisms is that children lose a week of schoolwork. With the pressure to do well at school increasing, children need every bit of help to maximise their potential. Taking them out of the school, it is therefore argued, stops them from getting access to needed education for a whole week. As the students won’t really be of much help to a workplace for just one week, it would therefore be better for them to remain at school.While this is a valid point, taking a child’s entire experience of school into account, a single week away does not make a significant difference. Indeed, if the timing of the week’s work placements is done correctly, the week can also serve as a kind of ‘holiday’ away from school, something that is regularly needed in order to allow students to remain fresh and enthusiastic. In many work placements, children also get to see some of things they learn at school put into a realistic context, allowing them to understand the relevance of what they learn and thereby creating a way to reinforce the learning.In addition to this, schoolchildren can be quite nervous about the world of work that they will have to join at some point in their lives. By getting this short taste of what it is like, they can see that it is nothing to be scared about. As well as this, children will often have some ideas of what they want to do for a living, but are not sure. By allowing them to see a type of work they are considering, they are better able to decide whether that career could be suitable for them.I feel, therefore, that work placements can be seen as a positive development. Missing a short amount of school is not serious and the benefits that can be gained from the placements are significant.;"For some time now, it has become increasingly common to enroll children in what are referred to as ""work experience placements."" These placements typically involve taking children out of school for about a week to participate in various types of work. While some individuals critique this trend, I believe it ultimately offers a positive experience.One of the major criticisms is that children miss a week of schoolwork. As academic pressure mounts, it is important for students to receive every opportunity to reach their full potential. Critics argue that by taking students out of school, they are deprived of crucial educational experiences for an entire week. They further contend that students, being untrained, would not contribute meaningfully to a workplace in such a short time, and therefore would be better off staying in school.Although this point is understandable, when considering a child’s overall educational journey, a week away from school is not likely to have a significant impact. In fact, if the timing of the work placements is well-planned, the experience can act as a refreshing break from regular school routines, which can be essential for maintaining students' motivation and enthusiasm. Additionally, work placements often allow children to see how their school lessons translate into real-world applications, thereby enhancing their understanding and reinforcing the relevance of their education.Moreover, many schoolchildren feel anxious about entering the workforce in the future. A brief opportunity to experience work can help demystify that realm, showing them there is nothing to be afraid of. Many children also have tentative career interests but may lack clarity. By exposing them to potential job environments, they can gain insights that help determine if a particular career path aligns with their aspirations.In conclusion, I see work experience placements as a positive development. Missing a small amount of school is not a significant issue, especially considering the considerable benefits that can be derived from such placements."
1413;Millions of people every year move to English- speaking countries such as Australia, Britain or America, in order to study at school, college or university.

This essay will describe in detail why English is an important international language.Firstly, the English language is widely used in many countries and at present, the world traders are currently developing rapidly. In order to compete with people from different countries, it is to be able to communicate the English language. For example, China has been improving a lot in many sectors. They are able to compete with other countries because many people in China English language and they are trying hard to study English.Secondly, many companies prefer to employ people who can speak English because if the companies create new in different countries, the employers are able to move the new branch without new people and the branch company is still able to communicate with the central company. In fact, one of the largest companies in the world (Google) has created some in different countries and each of the Google is able to discuss things or otherwise communicate even though they are in different countries because they all use English to communicate.In conclusion, many people move to English speaking countries for further studies because they believe that it will improve their English skills and in order to become a successful person in the future, mastering English is .;In today's world, language plays a crucial role in personal and professional development.

This essay will explore the importance of English as an international language in detail.To begin with, English is extensively used across numerous countries, and in today’s fast-paced global marketplace, effective communication in English is essential for competition. For instance, China has made significant strides in various sectors, largely because many Chinese individuals have adopted English as a second language and are committed to mastering it. This ability enables them to effectively compete on the global stage.Furthermore, many companies favor hiring employees who are proficient in English. This preference is especially important for businesses that expand into new markets, as it allows existing employees to transfer to new branches without the need for additional staff. For example, Google, one of the largest corporations globally, has established offices in various countries. Employees in these locations can collaborate and communicate effectively, despite being in different parts of the world, because they all use English as their common language.In conclusion, numerous individuals choose to pursue their studies in English-speaking nations, believing that this experience will enhance their English language skills. For anyone aspiring to achieve success in the future, mastering English is imperative.
795;Missions to explore space are hugely expensive, and there are problems on Earth which demand attention. The number of these missions needs to be reduced.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is supposed by many, that high-cost space studies should be cut off while more focus should be paid to the challenges mankind face on Earth. This essay completely disargees with such view because of two reasons that will de developed further.The first reason is that only rich countries spend thier budgets for space studies. This means that only when states have resolved most of their problems with poverty, level of medicine treatment, safety, they can divert some of the funds to invest in future technologies. Moreover, citizens will go on a strike and make the govenment to deal with real life problems instead of dreaming about the space. For example, not more than 5% of USA GDP is spent on space programs that is sufficient to progress, construct new sputniks, and send astronauts to the Internations Space Station.The second argument supposes that many space technologies have a dual puropose. In other words, being initially developed for studing the space, they were adopted to make people's day-to-day life easier. For example, mobile phones and the mobile Internet, navigaion using GPS would not be possibe if people were not trying to explore space.In conclusion, new technologies are developed when people are trying to learn the world outside our planet. This;Many believe that funding for expensive space research should be reduced in favor of addressing the challenges that humanity faces on Earth. This essay strongly disagrees with that perspective for two key reasons, which will be elaborated upon further.The first reason is that only affluent countries allocate a portion of their budgets to space programs. This indicates that nations can only invest in future technologies after resolving pressing issues such as poverty, healthcare, and safety. Furthermore, citizens may protest, urging their governments to focus on immediate, tangible problems rather than aspiring towards space exploration. For instance, the United States allocates no more than 5% of its GDP to space programs, a percentage that is sufficient to make significant advancements, develop new satellites, and send astronauts to the International Space Station.The second argument highlights that many technologies developed for space exploration have practical applications on Earth. In other words, innovations originally designed for studying space have been adapted to enhance everyday life. For example, the development of mobile phones, mobile internet, and GPS navigation would not have been possible without the pursuit of space exploration.In conclusion, the pursuit of knowledge beyond our planet drives the development of new technologies that ultimately benefit human life on Earth.

Therefore, hesitate to agree with the above mentioned statement.Your essay has several confusing sentences, where your meaning is unclear.You mix advantages and disadvantages of the modern medicine in one paragraph when you should divide them – have advantages in one paragraph and disadvantages in another.If you agree with the statement, you should have 2 paragraphs supporting your opinion and one supporting the opposite opinion, in your essay it is 2 against and 1 for.";"Modern medicine plays a crucial role in promoting longevity. It relies on advanced technology and a deep understanding of the human body. For these reasons, I believe that modern medicine contributes significantly to living longer lives. Firstly, modern medicine has the ability to prevent previously untreatable diseases. Physicians can often detect illnesses at their earliest stages and provide patients with appropriate treatments. Furthermore, educated individuals in society typically enjoy longer lifespans due to the advancements offered by modern medicine. This is vital for human civilization, as their innovative contributions can be utilized to assist others for an extended period. As the population ages, it's essential for economies—particularly in developing countries—to value the wisdom and experience of older individuals. Their life lessons are invaluable, encapsulating the idea that ""experience is more valuable than qualifications."" On the other hand, there are drawbacks to modern medicine. Some people may become dependent on it, leading to a life revolving around constant medication. Additionally, modern medical treatments can be prohibitively expensive, making them inaccessible for those in poorer nations. This commercialization of healthcare raises issues of equity; while those with financial means can access these treatments, indigenous or traditional medicine often provides a more compassionate alternative that is less reliant on wealth.In conclusion, I believe that modern medicine significantly aids in extending life expectancy. The advancements in technology enable the early detection of diseases, allowing for prompt intervention. Thus, I support the assertion that modern medicine enhances our ability to live longer, while recognizing its limitations and the importance of equitable healthcare access."
1315;More and more people today are drinking sugar-based drinks. Why is this happening? What measures can be taken to reverse this trend?;An alarming number of people today consume sugar-based drinks, whether it is in the form of soda, energy drinks or fruit drinks. Often consumers are lured by their widespread availability and convenience, however, marketing campaigns also play a role, targeting young people and giving them the perception that sugary drinks are not as unhealthy as they actually are.The availability of these types of drinks has greatly increased over time. They can now be found in almost any store or restaurant, which makes them easily accessible to almost anyone. The fact that they are often cheaper than alternatives, such as water or freshly squeezed juice, makes them an especially attractive option for those on a budget. Marketing campaigns for sugary beverages have been quite successful in creating positive associations attached to these products through advertisements on TV and billboards. This encourages people to consider them fun rather than unhealthy and normalises them within society.Luckily, reversing the rise in popularity of sugary drinks is still possible, if we act now and attack the problem from different angles. One of the very first steps should be educating people on the health risks associated with high sugar intake so that they can make better-informed decisions when selecting what type of beverage they consume. Companies should also be held accountable by law for their misleading marketing campaigns aimed at children and teenagers who are more likely to believe the false claims about their products’ health benefits without fully understanding what’s being sold to them. Schools, colleges and universities, and any institutions catering for young people, should consider banning sugary drinks and replacing them with refreshing alternatives without added sugar.Overall, it is important that we recognise the potential health risks posed by consuming too much sugar from soft drinks and take actionable steps towards reversing this trend in order to ensure our long-term wellbeing. Through greater education, government regulation, and increased corporate responsibility we can ensure that more people understand why reducing their intake of sugary beverages is important while still allowing them to access enjoyable yet healthier options.;"The prevalence of sugar-laden beverages among today's population is concerning, whether in the form of sodas, energy drinks, or fruit juices. Consumers are often enticed by their easy availability and convenience, but effective marketing strategies also target younger audiences, fostering a misleading perception that these sugary drinks are not as detrimental to health as they truly are. Over the years, the accessibility of these beverages has surged; they can be found in nearly every store and restaurant, making them an appealing choice for many. Additionally, their lower cost compared to healthier options like water or fresh juice makes them especially attractive for budget-conscious individuals.Marketing efforts for sugary drinks have effectively created positive associations through advertisements on television and billboards, leading people to view these products as fun rather than harmful, thus normalizing their consumption in society. Fortunately, it is still possible to combat the growing trend of sugary drink consumption if we take prompt and multifaceted action. A primary step should be to educate the public about the health risks linked to high sugar consumption, enabling individuals to make more informed choices regarding their beverage selections. Companies must also be held legally accountable for their misleading marketing practices, particularly those targeting children and teenagers who may easily fall for exaggerated claims regarding the health benefits of these products. Furthermore, schools, colleges, and other institutions catering to young people should contemplate banning sugary drinks and introducing healthier, sugar-free alternatives.Ultimately, it is crucial to acknowledge the health risks associated with excessive sugar intake from soft drinks and to take concrete measures to reverse this trend for the sake of our long-term health. By enhancing education, implementing government regulations, and promoting corporate responsibility, we can ensure that more people understand the importance of reducing their sugary beverage intake while still having access to enjoyable and healthier options."
1259;More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Over the past decades, it has been registered a considerable decrease in the percentage of people eager to create a family at a young age. There could be different reasons for this and I am going to state them clearly in the following paragraphs, which will also explain why I believe the advantages of this situation far outweigh the disadvantages.Apparently, the society we currently live in has undergone substantial changes over the years, sometimes without us even noticing it. The most evident of these variations has probably been the gradual rise in the number of old people as opposed to the dramatic fall in the number of births. In fact, owing to the decline of the economy of most nations and the subsequent reduction of work opportunities, more and more people are giving up on the idea of becoming parents in their 20s or 30s. Many people see this as a negative aspect for our society; however, I have to strongly disagree with their opinion.The drawbacks to which a lot of people point out when discussing about these kind of topics often has to do with the age gap between parents and their children. Admittedly, someone cannot decide to have a child in their 40s without considering the significant generation gap that would separate them from their kids and, as a result, the issues of miscommunication that could arise.However, the disadvantages become of secondary importance as soon as the much more remarkable benefits are examined. First of all, older parents also means more responsible and mature caretakers; consequently, due to their broader life experience, they would arguably make better advisors for their kids. Not to mention that older parents would not only have more stable and secure jobs, but they would also have more consistent savings to devote to their children's further education, which in turn could help the latter having a better and well-paid job in the future.To conclude, although it's impossible not to take into account the drawbacks of having a child at a more advanced age, the advantages still outrun the disadvantages. Thus, children would be the first to benefit from such a situation.";In recent decades, there has been a significant decline in the percentage of individuals eager to start a family at a young age. Various factors may contribute to this trend, and I will outline them in the following paragraphs, explaining why I believe the benefits of this situation far exceed the drawbacks. Our society has experienced substantial changes over the years, often without us fully realizing it. One of the most noticeable shifts is the increase in the older population in contrast to the substantial decrease in birth rates. This trend can largely be attributed to the economic decline in many nations and the resulting reduction in job opportunities, leading more individuals to postpone parenthood until their 30s or even later. While many view this shift as a negative development for society, I strongly disagree with that perspective.Critics often highlight certain drawbacks, particularly the age gap between parents and their children. It is true that having a child later in life can create a significant generational divide, potentially leading to communication challenges. However, these disadvantages pale in comparison to the many beneficial aspects of older parenthood. Firstly, older parents tend to be more responsible and mature caregivers, drawing on their greater life experience to serve as better role models and advisors for their children. Additionally, they are likely to have stable jobs and more substantial savings, which they can allocate toward their children's education. This financial security can ultimately help their children secure better-paying jobs in the future.In conclusion, although the challenges of having children at an older age should not be overlooked, the advantages significantly outweigh the drawbacks. Ultimately, it is the children who stand to gain the most from this shift in family planning.
1425;Most high level positions in companies are filled by men, even though the workforce in many developed countries consists of 50 percent female workers. Companies should be required to allocate a certain percentage of management positions to women. Discuss, what is your opinion?;"The inequality between men and women has always been a significant issue in society. , it is undeniable that most vital positions in companies are taken by males, not females. Therefore, that companies should allocate to women a certain number of these positions. However, I do not agree with this requirement completely.In some feudal countries, it was true to say that the society the males, and at that time instances of inequality occurred very frequently. Up until the present moment, it in some developing countries; also it is greatly . A large number of women in these countries are not allowed to go to work or even go to . In this case, this is not an individual issue, but social problem. The governments should have some solution to this tendency, and at the same time they should promulgate a new legislation to protect women’s .On the other hand, the global economy is developing rapidly nowadays. In most corporations, distinguish men from women; they only focus on working efficiently. In this world, any employees who possess enough abilities and work in an effective way, be promoted to positions. Therefore, allocating the high level positions in companies to women is not necessary. Moreover, the instances of women in essential positions . Those women are very successful in their work and their lives.In conclusion, although the inequality between men and women has reduced, it still is a social issue worth . Personally, in my opinion we should create as many opportunities for women to have an equal life as we can.";The disparity between men and women has long been a significant concern within society. It is evident that many key positions in companies are predominantly occupied by men rather than women. As a result, I believe companies should establish a certain quota for women in these roles. However, I do not entirely agree with this approach. Historically, in some feudal societies, men held a dominant position, leading to frequent instances of inequality. This situation persists in certain developing countries, where many women are prohibited from working or pursuing education. In these cases, the issue transcends individual circumstances and becomes a societal problem. Governments must implement solutions to address this trend and introduce legislation to protect women’s rights.Conversely, the global economy is evolving quickly today. In most corporations, the distinction between men and women is minimal, as the primary focus is on efficiency and productivity. In this context, any employee, regardless of gender, who demonstrates sufficient skills and effectiveness can be promoted. Consequently, reserving high-level positions exclusively for women may not be necessary. Furthermore, many women are already thriving in critical roles, showcasing their success in both their professional and personal lives.In conclusion, while the gap between men and women has narrowed, it remains a pressing social issue. In my view, it is essential to create as many opportunities as possible for women to achieve equality in all aspects of life.
1390;News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in a newspaper. What factors do you think influence their decisions? Do we become used to bad news? Would it be better if more good news was reported?;. There are two factors that influence their decisions. The first is the kind of customers they aim at. each kind of readers and watchers has its own features. For example, if your customers are almost entirely teenagers, you have to concentrate on something attracting them such as stories, photographs of singer stars, film stars, funny tales, and fashion. It be very silly if you to provide teenagers with economic or news. On the contrary, and politicians may never read news about James Blunt or Keira Knightley. Therefore, what influences news editors’ decisions the most is the taste of their customers.The second factor is how hot and attractive the news is. Who or watch news from a year or a month ago or even about something that happened last week? The answer is . In the energetic and competitive world nowadays, people always ask for a really news. So that to satisfy customers, there is a pressure on all editors to find continually what has already happened not only yesterday but even an hour ago. Or else, they may lose their customers. None of editors wants that bleak future.The type of news is also an important consideration. Whether on television or in newspapers, we seem to get more of and become used to bad news. It is harder for us to come across a piece of good news. We can’t deny that bad things happen on Earth day by day. However, news editors try to gain more and more , which means more and more money, using bad news as a magnet. bad news makes us curious. We want to know why it is bad, what it is about, whether it influences us or not. As a result, we will buy newspapers or watch television to find out. And the happiest people are, of course, news editors.In my view it would be better if more good news reported. Bad news makes us good news makes us happy. There should an an equal amount of good and bad news. In that way we can give something bad a lot of thought while still being happy about the good news. Any inequalities between good news and bad news should be avoided. Nowadays we cannot live without news, and for that reason the role of news editors became very important. We should support them, and in turn they should try their best to provide us with useful news, both good and bad.;"There are two main factors that shape the decisions of news editors. The first is the target audience they aim to reach. Different types of readers and viewers have distinct preferences. For instance, if the audience consists mainly of teenagers, the content should focus on topics that appeal to them, such as articles about celebrities, engaging stories, humorous anecdotes, and fashion trends. It would be ineffective to present teenagers with financial news or serious current events. Conversely, politicians are unlikely to be interested in stories about pop stars like James Blunt or Keira Knightley. Thus, the primary influence on news editors’ choices is the tastes of their audience.The second factor is the timeliness and appeal of the news itself. Who wants to hear about events from a month ago, or even last week? In today’s fast-paced and competitive environment, people are constantly seeking fresh news. As a result, editors face significant pressure to find stories that are not only recent, but also breaking—sometimes just an hour old. Failing to deliver this can risk losing their audience, which is a situation none of them would want to face.Furthermore, the nature of the news is another critical consideration. Whether on television or in newspapers, it seems that we are bombarded with negative stories, making positive news harder to come by. While it’s true that unfortunate events occur daily, news editors often focus on negative stories as a way to attract more readers, which translates into increased revenue. Bad news sparks curiosity; people want to understand the details, how it impacts them, and what it means. Consequently, they turn to news sources to explore these issues, benefiting the editors in the process.In my opinion, it would be preferable to see more positive news coverage. While bad news evokes a sense of concern, good news brings joy. Striving for a balance between good and bad news allows us to reflect on negative events while also celebrating positive ones. We should aim to reduce the imbalance between the two. Given our reliance on news in today’s world, the role of news editors is increasingly significant. We should support them, and in return, they should strive to provide a well-rounded mix of both positive and negative news."
1321;Newspapers have a significant influence on people’s ideas and opinions. Why is this happening? Is it a positive or negative situation?;Many people believe that newspapers play a pivotal role in shaping the way we think. There are numerous ways in which this affects our society, and I believe that this influence is mostly negative.Newspapers have long been a source of valuable information that has kept societies abreast of the latest happenings in the world. Since the average citizen has minimal knowledge about the information in expert analysis articles, well-established newspapers are powerfully poised to form public opinion through attention-grabbing images and carefully worded commentary. This leaves the reader no choice but to trust the accuracy of what they have read.Sadly, unbiased objectivity, which used to be the core idea behind journalism, seems to be a thing of the past. The arrival and spread of social media platforms has caused a gradual decline in print media subscriptions and their circulation, since readers tend to favor the internet and social media to stay informed about current affairs. This gave rise to a worrying trend of newspapers using sensationalist and controversial tactics to improve their sales. As a result, the constant barrage of bad news has led to a society that sees itself as more vulnerable and powerless than ever. To make matters worse, there are plenty of well-documented instances where newspapers have been used to spread false propaganda which is usually politically motivated.All in all, although newspapers are our lifeline to the world around us, the recent trend of publishing misinformation has had a mostly negative impact on readers. It is my hope that newspapers will go back to publishing impartial accounts of the latest news in the future.;Many individuals hold the belief that newspapers are crucial in shaping public perception. This influence manifests in numerous ways throughout society, and I contend that it is predominantly negative. For a long time, newspapers have served as a vital source of information, keeping communities informed about global events. Given that the average person often lacks the expertise to fully understand complex analyses, well-established newspapers wield significant power in shaping public opinion through striking visuals and meticulously crafted commentary. Consequently, readers are often left with little choice but to trust the information presented to them.Regrettably, the principle of unbiased journalism, which once stood at the heart of news reporting, appears to be fading. The rise of social media platforms has contributed to a gradual decrease in print media subscriptions and circulation, as many people now prefer online sources for current events. In response, some newspapers have resorted to sensationalism and controversy to boost their sales. This relentless stream of negative news has fostered a societal outlook characterized by feelings of vulnerability and powerlessness. Additionally, there are numerous documented cases where newspapers have propagated false propaganda, often with political motives.In conclusion, while newspapers remain an essential connection to the world around us, the prevailing trend of disseminating misinformation has largely cast a negative shadow over their impact on readers. I hope that in the future, newspapers will return to providing balanced and impartial news coverage.
1391;Nowadays environmental problems are too big to be managed by individual persons or individual countries. In other words, it is an international problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;An essential problem of the 21st century is world pollution. Currently the environment is so contaminated that urgent measures should be taken. A single individual cannot be blamed for the world pollution, however every person should take care of his or her habitat. In addition, it is vital that environmental issues are treated internationally.Lately, many presentations, conferences and international summits are held to deal with waste treatment, recycling, and soil and water contamination. joint efforts and consolidation can only help in the mutual war the ongoing environmental disaster. For instance, governments should offer support to companies and organizations, involved in manufacturing, industry or agriculture in order to find environment-friendly approaches. These could be special law regulations, recycling programs, helping courses in order to implement ISO certificates and many more.However, the influence of individuals over environment should not be ignored. If we do not that our planet is our home, we will never be able to take care of it. We have to contribute every day to the preservation of nature and environment. For example, always remember to save energy by switching off lamps, computers and everything that we do not use. Our next obligation is to separate waste and throw bulk only in the designated areas. Driving vehicles can also be environment friendly. For example, we have to avoid accelerating the engines too rapidly or using the air conditioning in the country, where it would be better to save energy and simply open the windows.To sum up, environmental problems should be handled by local and international authorities as well as individuals. Every single person should take care of the environment, moreover we have to bring up our children to be conscious citizens of a clean and preserved planet.;"A critical issue of the 21st century is global pollution. The environment is currently so polluted that immediate action is required. While no single person can be held accountable for worldwide pollution, it is essential for everyone to take responsibility for their surroundings. Moreover, addressing environmental challenges must be a global endeavor.Recently, numerous presentations, conferences, and international summits have been organized to tackle issues such as waste management, recycling, and contamination of soil and water. Collective efforts and collaboration are crucial in combating the ongoing environmental crisis. Governments should provide support to businesses and organizations in manufacturing, industry, and agriculture to promote eco-friendly practices. This could include the establishment of specific regulations, recycling initiatives, training programs to obtain ISO certifications, and more.However, the impact of individual actions on the environment should not be overlooked. Recognizing that our planet is our home is fundamental to caring for it. We must contribute daily to the conservation of nature and the environment. Simple actions, like conserving energy by turning off lights, computers, and other unused devices, go a long way. Additionally, it is important to separate waste and dispose of it in designated areas.Driving can also be environmentally conscious; for instance, avoiding rapid acceleration and minimizing air conditioning in rural areas can save energy—simply opening the windows can be a better option.In conclusion, environmental issues require attention from both local and international authorities as well as from individuals. Each person has a role to play in caring for the environment, and it is vital that we educate our children to become responsible stewards of a clean and sustainable planet."
1368;Nowadays families move to different countries for work and some think it has a negative effect on children (agree/disagree);Nowadays families move to different countries for work. Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Recent advancements, in technology and transportation in particular, are reshaping our world in an unprecedented manner. Nowadays, it is not unusual for people to work abroad. Most expatriates relocate their families to the countries . Some people argue that this phenomenon negatively affects children, however, I agree with those who believe the opposite is true.Those who think that relocating children to a new place is undesirable do so for many reasons. Their most common argument is the negative impact of moving on a child’s personality. There is no doubt that living in a different community comes with its challenges, especially to young people, as they get exposed to behaviours, actions and customs they might not be familiar with. As a result, children could possibly feel a lack of stability and some confusion. It is also likely that their patriotic feelings and sense of belonging to their home country could weaken as they would miss many opportunities to celebrate their national events.Nevertheless, I firmly believe that opinion to be ludicrous, as it seems that getting exposed to a new culture is beneficial in many ways. It fosters young social and emotional capabilities. Moreover, children living abroad have better opportunities to and practice new languages. Mastering more than one language improves not only their intellectual development, but also their opportunities in acquiring better jobs in the future. According to a recent study published by the University of Chicago, competency in more than one language increases employment chances on average by 200%.In conclusion, I strongly believe that living in a different country positively affects children in all aspects. Acquiring new languages, and an open minded and tolerant personality are just few examples of the many possible benefits.This essay presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt. The writer’s ideas are relevant and well‐supported. The arrangement of information and use of cohesive devices are fine, perhaps with a slight overuse in the second body paragraph. Sentence structures are complex, and the vocabulary is varied and appropriately used, except for some minor grammatical/spelling mistakes. This essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;In today's world, many families are relocating to different countries due to work opportunities. While some individuals believe this trend has a detrimental effect on children, others hold an opposing view. This essay will explore both perspectives before I present my own opinion.Recent developments in technology and transportation have significantly transformed the way we live and work. It has become increasingly common for individuals to take jobs overseas, often bringing their families along. Critics argue that moving can adversely affect children for several reasons. One of their key points is the potential negative impact on a child's personality and stability. Adjusting to a new environment can be challenging, particularly for young people, who might struggle with unfamiliar behaviors, customs, and practices. This adjustment period can lead to feelings of instability and confusion. Furthermore, these children might experience a diminished sense of patriotism and belonging to their home country, missing out on important national celebrations.However, I firmly contend that the advantages of living in a new culture far outweigh the challenges. Exposure to different cultural experiences can enhance children's social and emotional skills. Additionally, relocating to a new country often provides children with the opportunity to learn and practice new languages. Bilingualism not only enriches cognitive development but also significantly increases future job prospects. A recent study from the University of Chicago indicates that proficiency in more than one language can boost employment opportunities by an impressive 200%.In summary, I strongly advocate that living in another country has a predominantly positive impact on children. The ability to learn new languages and develop an open-minded, tolerant outlook are just a few of the many benefits they can gain from such experiences. Overall, I believe that the opportunities provided by international relocation can foster personal growth and enhance future prospects for children.
1350;Nowadays many people choose ready-made food and refuse to cook at home, why and what are the advantages/disadvantages?;Nowadays many people choose ready-made food and refuse to cook at home. Why do you think it happens? What are the advantages and disadvantages of such a choice?It is a very popular practice in the modern society to order ready-made food from restaurants, rather than cooking at home. The main reasons for such a tendency may be cheap prices in some restaurants and people’s desire to save some time . Even though ordering food some obvious advantages, its disadvantages should not be underestimated.On the one hand, ordering prepared food may be the best choice for a busy person, who does not have time for cooking and cleaning. Cooking food at home requires a considerable amount of time, moreover the cleaning process may take even more time and resources than cooking itself. For example, cooking a simple dish such as chicken with rice home requires significant amounts of water and electricity for electrical appliances such as the oven and dishwasher. Hence, having an opportunity to order food from a restaurant will save a lot of time, electricity and water.On the other hand, delegating the process of cooking to some restaurant a dramatic disadvantage of not having the information about the ingredients used in the meals. With high demand, grow the volumes of required products, which sometimes can affect the quality of purchased produce. For example, it is a very common practice in some restaurants to make salads from products that are about to go bad and mask the rotten scent by adding some chemicals and spices. Hence, some restaurants may use poor quality products or chemicals for boosting taste and preservatives, which may have a negative effect on the customer’s health in the long run.In conclusion, ordering food from restaurants may be a tempting choice for people who have no time for cooking at home, but this approach has a critical disadvantage of being not informed about the ingredients used in the meal, which can have destructive consequences.This response covers the task requirements by giving a reason why people would choose to buy ready-made food and discussing the advantages and disadvantages of this trend. The ideas are conveyed quite clearly and supported by examples, paragraphing helps to present the information in a neat and easy to follow way, and the level of coherence is adequate in this essay. A range of complex sentence forms and advanced vocabulary is used and there are very few instances of erroneous grammar or inaccurate expressions (see corrections underlined in blue). Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.;In today's society, many individuals opt for ready-made meals instead of cooking at home. What factors contribute to this trend? What are the pros and cons associated with this choice? It has become increasingly common for people to order food from restaurants rather than prepare their own meals. Key reasons for this shift include the affordability of certain restaurant options and the desire to save time. While there are clear advantages to ordering food, the downsides should not be overlooked.On one hand, ordering prepared meals can be an ideal solution for busy individuals with little time to spare for cooking and cleaning. Preparing food at home demands a significant investment of time, and the subsequent cleaning can be even more time-consuming and resource-intensive. For instance, cooking a simple dish like chicken and rice involves considerable water and electricity consumption for appliances such as ovens and dishwashers. Therefore, the option to order food from restaurants offers substantial savings in terms of time, energy, and water usage.Conversely, entrusting the cooking process to a restaurant brings with it the significant drawback of not knowing what ingredients are included in the meals. As demand for food increases, so does the volume of ingredients required, which can sometimes compromise quality. For example, it is not unusual for certain restaurants to prepare salads using ingredients that are nearing their expiration and to mask any unpleasant odors with chemicals and spices. Consequently, some establishments may resort to using low-quality ingredients or additives to enhance flavor and preserve food, which can have harmful effects on customers' health over time.In summary, while ordering from restaurants may be an attractive option for those pressed for time, this choice carries the crucial disadvantage of a lack of transparency regarding the ingredients used, potentially leading to detrimental health consequences. This analysis addresses the reasons behind the preference for ready-made meals and examines the associated benefits and drawbacks. The arguments are clearly articulated and supported by examples, with effective paragraphing that enhances readability. Additionally, the use of complex sentence structures and advanced vocabulary minimizes grammatical errors, potentially positioning this essay for a Band 8 score in IELTS.
1316;Nowadays many teenagers have a celebrity who they follow as a role model. Some people think this is not a good idea, because celebrities often set a bad example. Do you agree or disagree?;It is not uncommon for teenagers to worship celebrities. From singers to actors, many young people around the world look up to these stars and attempt to emulate their lifestyles. In my opinion, allowing children to idolize celebrities can often be detrimental, as they frequently set a poor example.Many of today’s celebrities tend to lack moral values, and they promote behaviour inappropriate for young people. For instance, some music videos feature explicit lyrics glorifying drug use and violence. In addition, the media often reports on celebrities who indulge in excessive partying or drinking alcohol despite being underage. These types of headlines can have a negative influence on impressionable teens who might falsely believe that they should follow suit to appear cool or successful.Poor morals aren’t the only issue, as many popular stars are also well-known for their irresponsible spending habits. They routinely splurge on luxury items such as designer clothing or expensive cars without any consideration for budgeting or saving money responsibly. This kind of behaviour is dangerous because it is normalizing materialism and teaching teens that costly possessions will bring them happiness instead of focusing on what really matters in life: meaningful relationships, knowledge, and hard work.To conclude, young adults should keep in mind that society’s perception of fame and fortune is based on temporary, insubstantial things rather than what actually matters. In the grand scheme of things, it would be far more beneficial for teenagers to spend time developing their own set of values rooted in quality education and strong family relationships.;"It's quite common for teenagers to idolize celebrities. From musicians to actors, numerous young people across the globe admire these stars and often try to replicate their lifestyles. In my view, allowing children to look up to celebrities can be harmful, as many of them often set negative examples. Today's celebrities frequently demonstrate a lack of moral integrity, promoting behaviors that are unsuitable for impressionable youth. For example, certain music videos contain explicit lyrics that glorify drug use and violence. Additionally, the media often highlights celebrities who engage in excessive partying or underage drinking. Such portrayals can adversely affect impressionable teens, who may mistakenly believe they need to engage in similar behaviors to be deemed cool or successful.Moreover, the ethical issues don't end there; many popular figures are also notorious for their reckless spending habits. They often lavishly buy luxury items—like designer clothes or extravagant cars—without any regard for prudent budgeting or saving. Such actions can dangerously normalize materialism and convey to teenagers that happiness lies in expensive possessions rather than in what truly matters: meaningful relationships, education, and hard work.In conclusion, young adults should remember that society's view of fame and wealth is based on fleeting, insubstantial values, rather than what is truly important. Ultimately, it would benefit teenagers far more to focus on establishing their own values grounded in quality education and strong family bonds."
1359;Nowadays more and more people want to live by themselves, why is this happening?;Nowadays more and more people want to live by themselves. What are the reasons? Is it a positive or negative trend?These days a vast majority of people want to lead an independent life. The fundamental reason lies in people’s educational qualifications that fuel their craving for freedom in life. This can be seen as a positive trend because living alone is likely to nurture a mature mindset at early stages of one’s life.Many people are well educated to stand up on their own. Tertiary education broadens their horizons, and they wish to experience freedom of life. With a very good educational background it becomes easier to find a well-paid job, and with lucrative income they gain confidence to lead an independent life, thereby achieving their goals. For example, engineering graduates can find a job in another town and their salary is enough for them to move and settle down there. This enables them to move away from their family and live on their own.Living alone helps one to develop maturity, which can be seen as a positive impact on individuals and the society as a whole. Being independent means young people have to face life challenges alone and going through this process improves their resilience. They become more responsible, as they have to take care of themselves and develop budgeting skills and saving habits, for their future needs as well. Better planning of their finances nurtures the custom of wise spending at early stages of adult life.In conclusion, the reason why many people wish to live independently these days is because their education level gives them both the awareness of freedom in life and means of achieving it. Since living alone promotes one’s maturity, it seems to be a positive trend in today’s society.This response covers the task requirements by addressing the two parts of the question, why people choose to live alone and whether this is a positive trend. The ideas are clearly explained and supported, the information is organised in paragraphs in an easy to follow way, and the level of coherence is adequate. A range of complex sentence forms is used and there are no grammatical errors. Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.;In contemporary society, an increasing number of individuals are opting for solitary living. What drives this trend, and is it a positive or negative development? A significant portion of the population now seeks independence, primarily due to their educational achievements, which fuel a desire for personal freedom. This shift can be viewed as a positive trend, as living alone often fosters maturity in individuals at an early stage of life.Many people today are equipped with substantial education that empowers them to be self-sufficient. Higher education not only broadens their perspectives but also instills a desire to experience life freely. With robust qualifications, securing a well-paying job becomes more attainable, contributing to the confidence needed to pursue an independent lifestyle and achieve personal aspirations. For instance, engineering graduates often find employment opportunities in different cities, where their salaries enable them to relocate and establish their own living environments. This circumstance allows them to distance themselves from their families and embrace independent living.Residing alone promotes personal growth and maturity, which can positively influence both individuals and society at large. Independence necessitates that young people confront life’s challenges solo, thereby enhancing their resilience. They learn to take responsibility for their own well-being, developing essential budgeting skills and saving habits in preparation for future needs. This proactive financial planning cultivates wise spending patterns from the early stages of adulthood.In conclusion, the desire for independent living among many individuals today stems from their educational backgrounds, which provide both an awareness of personal freedom and the means to achieve it. Given that living alone encourages personal maturity, this trend appears to be a beneficial one in today’s society. This analysis effectively addresses both aspects of the inquiry: the motivations behind the choice to live alone and the assessment of whether it is a positive trend. The ideas are presented logically and clearly in structured paragraphs, with a variety of complex sentence forms employed and no grammatical errors noted. Overall, this essay would likely achieve a Band 8 in IELTS.

701;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. In this essay, the reason for wasting food and the acts which can be done by humans to reduce the amount of food one throws away will be thorougly discussed.Firstly, people waste food as one tends to be satisfied with the amount one eats. Thus, people order food more than one can eat as one can not estimate the amount of food. The amount of food one person can consume differs on one's conditions at that moment. The conditions include mood, physical features and activities one did on that particular day. Furthermore, one wants to taste all sorts of food, however, one can not eat all of those. Sometimes, people order food which are well decorated just to take a photo of it and upload it on social media such as Instagram. After taking photo, people just leave the food. The above mentioned reasons can be the causes of wastage of food.Apparently, people can reduce the amount of food they throw away. The restaurants can provide more informations about the amount and taste briefly to avoid the situation that consumers can not finish the food and are dissatisfied with the taste or smell. Moreover, consumers have to make a wise decision so that they do not waste both food and money. People should co-operate to reduce the wastage of food as it causes pollution on land. It leads to bad smell and brings insects to the areas.Conclusively, it is quite clear that people greatly waste food and there are a few ways for people to follow so as to reduce the amount of waste food.;Today, many individuals waste a significant amount of food purchased from stores and restaurants. This essay will explore the reasons behind food waste and the actions that can be taken to minimize the amount of food thrown away.To begin with, food waste often occurs because people struggle to gauge how much they can reasonably eat. As a result, they tend to order more food than they can consume, leading to excess. The quantity one can eat varies based on several factors, including mood, physical condition, and daily activities. Additionally, the desire to sample a variety of dishes contributes to waste, as individuals may order multiple items but cannot finish them all. Some even select visually appealing meals simply for the purpose of sharing them on social media platforms like Instagram, ultimately leaving them uneaten after snapping a photo. These factors contribute to the growing issue of food wastage.Fortunately, there are ways to reduce the amount of food thrown away. Restaurants could offer clearer information about portion sizes and flavors to help customers make more informed choices and avoid dissatisfaction with their meals. Furthermore, consumers need to be more conscious when ordering to prevent wasting both food and money. Collaboration among individuals is essential to combat food waste, as it not only contributes to pollution in landfills but also leads to unpleasant odors and attracts pests.In conclusion, it is evident that food waste is a significant issue, but there are several strategies individuals can adopt to help decrease the amount of food discarded.
1354;Nowadays people waste a lot of food, why is this happening and how to reduce waste?;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?At the time when famines heavily strike impoverished third world countries, many people living in wealthy countries waste tremendous amounts of food daily. In my opinion, understanding the probable reasons of this phenomenon is important and may lead us to some applicable solutions that will result in reducing food waste.The low cost of food seems to be one of the obvious reasons, exacerbating the problem. Due to the revolutionary technological achievements, people have increased both the quality and the quantity of their crops. In turn, according to the laws of supply and demand, the prices of the crops have immensely dropped. A recent study of the FAO stated that the global crops prices have dropped 50 per cent over the last decade. This enabled people to buy excessive amounts of food without a real need.Furthermore, the absence of strict regulations to discourage or punish this attitude can also be considered a major cause. Not everyone is aware that wasting food may create problems. Consequently, they are likely to resist any calls for controlling the consumption of dietary supplies unless they are forced by the power of law. Several countries in the world saw a drop in their national food waste after implementing a ban on the excessive purchasing of food.Fortunately, there are some possible approaches that can be adopted by both people and governments. Firstly, raising the awareness of this issue is immensely important. Using social media platforms can draw public attention to the potential dangers of food waste and how communities can confront it. Secondly, enforcing laws that prohibit the wasting of food by people and companies will deter such harmful practice.In conclusion, the decreased price of food as well as lack of regulations allowed the unfortunate trend of throwing away food to continue. I believe that creating awareness and legislation are parts of a straightforward solution to this issue.The writer explored the reasons for throwing away food and suggested some solutions, effortlessly conveying his/her ideas in this well-written IELTS essay. The information is presented in an orderly, logical and coherent way. A wide range of vocabulary is used in this written response. The sentence structures are varied and the vocabulary is impressive. Overall, this essay could achieve IELTS Band 8.;In contemporary society, a significant amount of food purchased from stores and restaurants goes to waste. What factors contribute to this food wastage, and how can we minimize the quantity that is discarded? While many impoverished countries grapple with famine, individuals in affluent nations consistently discard vast quantities of food every day. It’s crucial to examine the underlying reasons for this issue, as doing so can help us identify effective strategies to combat food waste.One apparent factor is the low cost of food, which exacerbates the situation. Technological advancements have greatly improved both the quality and quantity of food production. As a result, prices for agricultural products have significantly decreased, driven by the principles of supply and demand. A recent FAO report highlighted that global crop prices have fallen by 50% over the past decade, enabling consumers to purchase more food than they actually need.Another contributing factor is the absence of stringent regulations aimed at discouraging or penalizing food wastage. Many individuals are unaware of the potential issues caused by discarding food, making them resistant to calls for more conscientious consumption unless compelled by law. Countries that have enacted restrictions on excessive food purchases have often seen a notable reduction in national food waste.Fortunately, there are several strategies that both individuals and governments can employ to address this issue. Firstly, raising awareness about the importance of reducing food waste is essential. Social media can play a key role in highlighting the risks associated with food waste and rallying communities to tackle the problem together. Secondly, implementing laws that prohibit food waste by individuals and businesses can discourage such damaging behaviors.In conclusion, the low cost of food combined with a lack of regulatory measures has perpetuated the troubling trend of food waste. I believe that increasing awareness and implementing legislation are critical components of an effective solution to this pressing issue. The author effectively examined the reasons behind food wastage and proposed viable solutions in this well-structured IELTS essay, presenting information in a logical and coherent manner. The essay showcases a diverse vocabulary, varied sentence structures, and strong articulation of ideas, which could potentially earn an IELTS Band 8 rating.
1351;Nowadays that many women have full time jobs, it is logical to share the housework evenly between men and women (agree/disagree);Nowadays in many countries women have full time jobs. Therefore, it is logical to share household tasks evenly between men and women. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Nowadays an ever-increasing number of women work full time, and in this reality it is widely believed that house chores should be shared between men and women equally. I strongly agree with this statement.One of the reasons for sharing housework between is to promote gender equality. A stereotype that has existed a long time is that females ought to stay home, taking care of the family once they got married. This includes looking after the children and doing all of the housework, which is fairly labour-intensive. However, this approach could have quite a few disadvantages. It would render women less able of keeping abreast of what is happening in the job market, thus forming a lifestyle where they might find it arduous to step into the society again. To avoid this, many women are willing to get back into the workforce soon after their maternity leave, and once they do, it makes sense that their husbands should share part of the household chores, to fulfill their family responsibilities.Nevertheless, we cannot be oblivious several drawbacks of this trend. One potential downside is that men are less experienced in dealing with household tasks. This is because many seldom take an active role in doing housework, according to customs of many countries. As a result, they may end up doing household tasks in a less than perfect way, which could contribute to some unnecessary quarrels between partners, hindering their family bond. However, the likelihood of this happening isn’t very high, because wives can offer some tips or guidance to their husbands when they learn how to share house chores such as mopping floors or doing laundry.To sum up, although some conflicts might be triggered when equally sharing the duties of household tasks, the benefits of this trend are relatively oblivious.The writer covered the task well by discussing the positives and negatives of sharing housework equally between men and women. Each paragraph has a clear purpose and assists with orderly presentation of ideas, making this essay easy to follow. The ideas are explained and substantiated, and the writer’s opinion is clear. The range of vocabulary is wide enough to avoid unnecessary repetition. Accuracy of expression could be improved (see corrections underlined in blue), but all in all this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;In many countries today, women are increasingly participating in full-time employment. As a result, it is only reasonable that household responsibilities are shared equitably between men and women. I wholeheartedly support this viewpoint.One compelling reason for distributing household duties equally is to foster gender equality. For many years, a prevailing stereotype has suggested that women should remain at home, caring for the family after marriage. This encompasses responsibilities like child-rearing and managing all household chores, which are often time-consuming and physically demanding. However, adhering to this traditional mindset can lead to significant drawbacks. It may hinder women’s ability to stay informed about developments in the job market, making it challenging for them to reintegrate into professional life later on. To counteract this, many women choose to return to work shortly after their maternity leave, prompting the need for their partners to share household responsibilities to uphold their family obligations.On the other hand, we must acknowledge the potential drawbacks of this trend. One concern is that men may lack experience in performing household tasks. This can be attributed to traditional gender roles that have often relegated men to a less active role in domestic duties in various cultures. Consequently, they might approach household chores less effectively, leading to potential disagreements between partners and straining family relationships. However, the likelihood of such conflicts can be minimized, as wives can offer support and guidance to their husbands while they learn to share responsibilities, be it mopping the floors or doing laundry.In conclusion, while some conflicts may arise when household tasks are shared equally, the advantages of this approach are quite significant. The author effectively discusses both sides of the argument regarding equal distribution of housework between men and women. Each paragraph has a clear purpose, ensuring a coherent presentation of ideas, which makes the essay easy to read. The ideas are well-explained and supported, and the author's stance is evident. The vocabulary is diverse, helping to avoid unnecessary repetition. While there are areas where expression accuracy could be enhanced, overall, this essay is deserving of an IELTS Band 8 rating.
25;Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?;"It is a serious problem that there is an inadequate number of students who tend to select science as their major subject in universities in many countries. In my view, students may think that studying science has not a good career path. Also, this issue may deeply affect the international state of a country.The main reason why people do not think to study science is that they may see science as something unpractical, and potentially, they are hard to find a job when they graduate. Students are generally afraid that there is no employment opportunity after they graduate from university. Unlike engineering and business management, in which fields employers provide plenty of vocational positions for graduated students because there are lots of companies activating in these fields and universities may provide some practical training courses and internships. Students studying science have a relatively narrow way to walk, and may just be scientists. Moreover, although a successful scientist can get a massive bonus from some prizes, it is too hard to accomplish and is more likely to fail. Therefore, Students will avoid taking those risks and choose other subjects that are relatively stable and easy to find a job.This trend will eventually decrease the state of a country. Developing science can provide a strong and firm foundation for a country to establish a healthy and prosperous community. If there are not enough scientists, the whole scientific ability will decrease. Not only will the government pay extra money to other foreign countries to buy the required technology such as military equipment, but the public needs to spend more time and pay more effort to maintain the international standard production rate of a country. It is extremely dangerous that a nation easily suffers from a financial crisis and, finally, it influences the living standard of its citizens and causes damage to its financial systems.In summary, while science is regarded as a ""useless"" subject because of its narrow career path and low success rate, it is vital that the economic systems would be affected if a country develop without scientists.";"The insufficient number of students choosing science as their major in universities across many countries is a pressing issue. I believe that many students perceive studying science as lacking promising career prospects. This trend could have profound implications for a nation's international standing.A significant factor contributing to the reluctance to pursue science is the perception that it is impractical, leading to concerns about job availability after graduation. Students often fear that opportunities may be limited compared to fields like engineering and business management, where employers actively seek graduates due to the large number of companies operating in these areas. Additionally, universities in these fields typically offer practical training and internships. In contrast, science students often find their career paths restricted primarily to becoming scientists. Although a successful scientist can earn recognition and substantial rewards, achieving this success is challenging and fraught with the risk of failure. As a result, many students opt for other subjects that offer more stable and accessible job prospects.This trend poses a significant risk to a country's progress. Advancing scientific knowledge is crucial for building a robust foundation for a healthy and prosperous society. A shortage of scientists could hinder a nation's scientific capabilities, leading to increased reliance on foreign countries for essential technologies, including military equipment. Furthermore, the public may have to exert additional effort and resources to maintain the international production standards of their country. This situation could make a nation vulnerable to financial crises, negatively impacting the living standards of its citizens and harming its financial systems.In conclusion, while science may be viewed as a ""less useful"" field due to its limited career options and lower success rates, the absence of scientists could significantly affect a country's economic stability and development."

However, in recent years the number of children suffering from obesity has grown significantly. There are several causes and numerous solutions which can be used to tackle this worrying phenomenon, and this essay will present a couple of them.While some reasons for childhood obesity are genetic, others include poor food choices exacerbated by easy availability of fast food, insufficient physical activity and a history of family members being overweight. Unlike the former, the latter factors can be changed, if the adults in the child’s life gain awareness and are willing to take action.To begin with, health is a complex matter which requires a balanced approach. In other words, there isn’t a single solution to maintain health, on the contrary, it is rather a mixture of multiple factors, such as and regular physical activity. For this reason, increasing the awareness of healthy habits among children is a responsibility of utmost importance. What is more, it can be easily achieved through the education system.On the other hand, children’s education might to stop the situation from worsening. Along with well designed health education schemes, we should also try to stop food companies from overusing sugar in products the young ones. It has been proven that more than 70% of the products available in an average supermarket contain dangerously high levels of white sugar. Sugar rich diet not only causes a significant weight gain, but also contributes to diseases, such as diabetes in young population.To summarize, emphasis put on the awareness of healthy living among children is invaluable. Furthermore, combining healthy habits with stopping food companies from in products which are easily children can be effectively implemented by the governments. Positive outcomes of such measures taken today will definitely have a long lasting effect on the future generations.This is a well developed response to the question.

You should allocate approximately 40 minutes to complete this task. Obesity was traditionally viewed as a condition predominantly affecting adults, but in recent years, its prevalence among children has risen dramatically. This essay will explore some of the contributing factors to this alarming trend and suggest potential remedies to help children maintain a healthy lifestyle.While genetic predisposition plays a role in childhood obesity, other significant factors include unhealthy dietary choices, the widespread availability of fast food, lack of physical activity, and familial patterns of obesity. Unlike genetic factors, these lifestyle choices can be modified if the adults in a child's life become more proactive and informed.To address this issue effectively, a multifaceted approach to health is essential. There is no single solution; rather, a combination of various elements—such as a balanced diet and regular physical activity—is necessary for proper health maintenance. Hence, raising awareness of healthy habits among children is critical and could be effectively integrated into school curricula.Moreover, educational initiatives might prevent the escalation of this issue. Alongside well-structured health education programs, it is important to regulate food companies to reduce excessive sugar content in products marketed to children. Research indicates that over 70% of items in an average supermarket contain alarmingly high amounts of sugar. A diet high in sugar contributes significantly to weight gain and also increases the risk of diseases such as diabetes among the young.In conclusion, promoting awareness of healthy living among children is vital. Furthermore, combining this knowledge with measures to limit the sugar content in readily available foods can be initiated by governments. The positive effects of such actions taken today will undoubtedly benefit future generations in the long run.This response effectively addresses the question and includes relevant key points.

1418;People attend college or university for many different reasons (for example, new experiences, career preparation, or to increase knowledge).;Why do you think people attend college or university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Many people after their high school years for several reason which they choose . I believe that the most common reason why people to have new experiences on life , to prepare for a career, and to increase their knowledge of their personality.Firstly, many people to have new experience in life. Many students leave their home and move to live when they go to university. This is the first time that they had to make a resolution on their own, without their parents’ help. Making their own decisions will increase their knowledge of themselves. Moreover, students university can meet different students from different nationalities and religions so students can learn about different around the world.Secondly, many people go to university or collage to prepare for a career. Career training is becoming more important nowadays to young people compared to old people. At college, students learn many skills for their career and they internship with a lot of chances. All of these prepare them for their career.Also, students attend university or college to increase their self-knowledge of their personality life. They attend increase their knowledge in subjects which they find interesting. For example, many students study science because they are in science but they work .To sum up, I think people should not only focus on a career when they go to university or college. They have to follow to have new experience and knowledge about their personality and the great world around them which they live in.;What motivates individuals to attend college or university? There are various reasons, and I believe that the most prevalent ones include the desire for new life experiences, preparation for a career, and personal growth.Firstly, many students seek new experiences when they leave home for university. This transition often marks the first time they make important decisions independently, without parental guidance. Such autonomy allows them to better understand themselves. Additionally, attending university exposes students to diverse peers from various cultural and religious backgrounds, enriching their understanding of the world.Secondly, pursuing higher education is often essential for career preparation. In today's competitive job market, young people prioritize career training more than previous generations.

1253;People living in large cities have to face many problems in everyday life. What are those problems?Should the government encourage people to move to regional towns?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is not surprise to see that major cities are struggling with various issues which may associate with goverment and public issues as well.These issues are mild in some cities where as severe and vulnerable in few cities.Some of the common problems are increased crime rate,reduced safety,air pollution,noise pollution,flood,mechanical life and reduced greenery.The main cause for the above issues are increased population,uncontrolled carbon emission,poorly planned road and other public facilities such as underground drainage,contaminated water,roads and electricity.In general if the government take steps to control the above mentioned issues by implenting good law and orders which can improve public safety and happiness.Assist the sanitary boards with proper funding which may help to reduce water stagnant during rainy season.Funding for new research and developments may enhance to clear air and water pollution which can bring good health to the local residents.In contrast government may consider to develop the nearest towns with basic facilities such as modern housing,educational advancements,good roads,water and sanitary facilities. These facilities enhance the people to move to smaller town which may enhance to manage the key issues which are currently facing in the major cities.For instance Delhi,Capital of India seriously struggling with severe air pollution and lack of security which is heavily populated.Researches says that these problems can be reduced if the population rate is reduced.Meantime some group of people suggests that if the government may adopt new technology or structure which are following by any successful cities in the world.I personally feels that this also could be a better solution if it can be adopted by the government.By arguing the possitive and negative impacts it is difficult to conclude which option may works better to sove the issues.;It is no surprise that major cities are grappling with a range of issues, often linked to government and public concerns. While some cities experience these problems mildly, others face them with greater severity and vulnerability. Common challenges include rising crime rates, diminished safety, air and noise pollution, flooding, a fast-paced lifestyle, and declining green spaces.The primary drivers of these issues are population growth, uncontrolled carbon emissions, and poorly planned public infrastructure, such as drainage systems, contaminated water supplies, and inadequate roads and electricity services.To address these challenges, governments need to take proactive measures. Implementing effective laws and policies could enhance public safety and wellbeing. Providing adequate funding for sanitation departments could help mitigate stagnant water accumulation during the rainy season. Investing in new research and development initiatives could reduce air and water pollution, ultimately improving public health.Furthermore, the government should consider developing nearby towns with essential facilities like modern housing, educational resources, well-maintained roads, and sanitation services. This could encourage residents to relocate to smaller towns, which in turn would help alleviate some of the pressing issues faced by major cities.For example, Delhi, India's capital, is currently struggling with severe air pollution and safety concerns, largely due to its high population density. Research indicates that these problems could be alleviated by decreasing the population growth rate.Meanwhile, some advocate for the adoption of new technologies or urban structures modeled after successful cities worldwide. I believe this could also serve as a viable solution if implemented effectively by the government.Balancing the positive and negative impacts of various strategies makes it challenging to determine which option would be the most effective in resolving these issues.
645;People often think about creating an ideal society, but most of the times fail in making this happen.What is your opinion about an ideal societyHow can we create an ideal society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"One of the ambition of the people is to create a harmonious community to live in. Unfortunately, individuals often fail to create one. This essay will discuss what is an ideal society, as well as ways on how to make it happen.An ideal community is a place where peace of mind over shadows fear. We all now that everyone wants a place that is criminal free. For example, people can just walk in an aisle without thinking of being raped or kidnapped. Moreover, it is a community in which discrimination, prejudice and racism is prohibited. In short, everyone is treated equally regardless of gender, colors, religions, social status, jobs and looks. It also means that, people can just walk in and out of a hospital or establishments without being looked down or degraded by other people especially those with high status.However, it is difficult for people to meet this kind of standards. This mainly because nobody is made perfect and as a human being we are mostly dominated by hatred, jealousy and selfishness. Although people fail to have a perfect society, there are some ways on how to have a near perfect place to live. First of all, government should make the lives of the people a better one by being an active role model to the citizens. There should not be corruption involve amongst the higher ups. Also, as what the saying goes ""learning should start at home"", it means that, parents should the take the initiative to educate their children proper manners in dealing with other people. In Japan, children were taught in a very young age on how to treat other people. That is why they always bow down their head as a sign of respect.To conclude, creating an essential environment can be challenging and demanding for all of us. Eventhough, it is impossible to make, each one of us can has the capacity to contribute to make society an almost perfect one.";"One of the key aspirations of individuals is to establish a harmonious community to live in. Unfortunately, many struggle to achieve this goal. This essay will explore the concept of an ideal society and discuss ways to work towards its realization.An ideal community is characterized by a sense of safety that replaces fear. Everyone desires a space free from crime; for instance, it should be possible for individuals to stroll down a street without the worry of being assaulted or abducted. Additionally, it should be a place where discrimination, prejudice, and racism are nonexistent, and where everyone is treated equally, regardless of gender, race, religion, social status, occupation, or appearance. This means individuals should be able to enter a hospital or public establishment without facing judgment or degradation, particularly from those in positions of power.However, achieving such standards can be quite challenging. This is largely because nobody is perfect, and as human beings, we are often influenced by negative feelings such as hatred, jealousy, and selfishness. Despite the difficulties in creating a flawless society, there are strategies we can employ to foster a nearly ideal community. First and foremost, the government must strive to improve the lives of its citizens by serving as an active role model. This involves eradicating corruption among leaders. Furthermore, as the saying goes, ""learning begins at home""; therefore, parents should take the initiative to instill in their children the value of treating others with respect. In Japan, for example, children are taught from a young age how to interact kindly with others, which is why bowing is such a common gesture of respect.In conclusion, fostering a supportive environment can be a challenging undertaking for all of us. While achieving a perfect society may seem impossible, each of us has the potential to contribute towards making our community a significantly better place to live."
1326;People should follow the local customs and traditions, when they come to live in a new country. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The globalised world these days makes it simpler than ever before for people to relocate and start building a life in a new country. As everyone comes from their own cultural background, a question arises of whether or not people should be expected to follow the customs of their host country. I completely agree with the view that while learning about the local customs may require some time and effort, it is valuable and will aid the integration of the newcomers into society.In many cultures following the local customs means showing respect, which is an important moral value in nearly every culture. The opposite is also true: disregarding traditions is often seen as a sign of disrespect. In order to establish good neighbourly relationships and feel welcome in the new place, it is important to demonstrate the effort to become part of the community. By expressing an interest in learning traditions, new arrivals gain a chance to interact with their neighbours and colleagues, get to know them and build some connections in the new country.Another positive aspect is the enhanced feeling of belonging that people get from participating in activities others around them are doing. When a national festival is in full swing, standing on the sidelines might make people feel excluded and perhaps even homesick, whereas joining others opens up opportunities to attend special events together, go to parties, meet new people and feel part of the celebrations. In Australia, for example, Easter is a very special time of the year and some of the traditional activities include Easter egg decoration and gifting, and baking hot cross buns; sharing your designs and recipes with others is an excellent conversation starter.In conclusion, learning the customs and traditions of one’s new country doesn’t mean a loss of their own culture. On the contrary, it is an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of cultural connections and should be embraced as a positive experience.";"In today’s globalized world, relocating to a new country and starting anew has never been easier. Given our diverse cultural backgrounds, a pertinent question arises regarding whether newcomers should adhere to the customs of their host nation. I firmly believe that although assimilating into local traditions can take time and effort, it is a worthwhile endeavor that facilitates integration into society. In many cultures, respecting local customs signifies appreciation, a fundamental moral principle in nearly every society. Conversely, neglecting these traditions is frequently interpreted as a lack of respect. To foster good relationships with neighbors and feel welcomed in their new environment, newcomers should show a willingness to engage with the local community. By expressing an interest in local traditions, they can build connections with neighbors and colleagues, fostering friendships and support networks.Another advantageous aspect of embracing local customs is the enhanced sense of belonging that comes from participating in community activities. During national celebrations, remaining on the sidelines may lead to feelings of exclusion or homesickness, while joining in allows newcomers to partake in events, attend gatherings, meet new people, and celebrate together. For instance, in Australia, Easter is a significant occasion filled with traditions such as decorating Easter eggs, giving gifts, and baking hot cross buns; sharing these experiences and recipes can spark conversations and connections.In conclusion, familiarizing oneself with the customs and traditions of a new country does not entail abandoning one’s own culture. Instead, it offers a valuable opportunity to deepen cultural understanding and should be embraced as a rewarding experience."
1370;People should not work beyond the retirement age (agree/disagree);Some believe that people should not continue to work once they reach the age of retirement. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your experience.In recent years, with the improvement in healthcare sector and better , people are able to live longer and contribute to the economic progress of a nation more, compared to the past. Some see this as an entirely positive development, while others point out the drawbacks of working beyond the retirement age.Delaying retirement enables individuals to actively contribute to the society. On a personal level, working past retirement age provides an avenue for individuals to remain not only physically but also mentally active. Moreover, this option empowers the ageing population to be financially independent and economically self-sustainable past retirement age. In countries with growing ageing population such as Singapore, for instance, citizens are given an option to work beyond their retirement age based on the demands of their job and their capability to handle these tasks. Hence, working beyond retirement age empowers workers, ensures economic progression of the nation, and alleviates the challenges faced by an ageing population.On the flip side, working beyond the retirement age may result in adverse health impacts on workers and a decrease in productivity levels. In Japan, the suicide rates have recently been increasing due to rising stress levels at work faced by the ageing population who are pushed to work beyond their optimal capacity. Escalating stress levels from work to various health complications putting a strain on the healthcare system. Hence, working beyond retirement age may worsen the overall welfare of individuals and adversely impact the economy.To sum up, though working beyond retirement age health hazards leading to reduction in productivity levels, it seems to me that the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion, by assessing the capability of individuals and tailoring their jobs to their health profile, firms and companies should actively involve their workers to be productive beyond their retirement age.This essay is an excellent example of IELTS Band 8 writing. The author presents sound arguments making his/her point of view very clear, examples are being used to support the writer’s points and the organisation of information is handled very well. There are some minor inaccuracies, however, they wouldn’t affect the score much in the real test. Well done!;Some people argue that individuals should not continue working once they reach retirement age. Do you agree or disagree? Provide reasons for your perspective and include relevant examples from your own experiences.In recent years, advancements in healthcare and living standards have enabled people to live longer, allowing them to contribute more significantly to a nation's economic growth compared to previous generations. While some view this as a wholly positive change, others highlight the potential downsides of working beyond retirement age.Extending one's career can provide individuals with opportunities to remain engaged both physically and mentally. Personally, continuing to work after retirement age can help maintain a sense of purpose and vitality. Additionally, this option fosters financial independence and self-sufficiency for older adults. For example, in countries like Singapore, citizens have the choice to work beyond the conventional retirement age, depending on their job demands and personal capabilities. As a result, this practice not only empowers older workers but also contributes to the economic advancement of the country, while addressing challenges posed by an ageing population.However, there are also concerns that working past retirement age may lead to negative health effects and reduced productivity. In Japan, for instance, rising stress levels among older workers have contributed to increasing suicide rates, as many find themselves pressured to perform beyond their physical limits. The escalating stress associated with work can lead to various health complications, ultimately straining the healthcare system. Thus, the impact of working after retirement could detrimentally affect individual well-being as well as the broader economy.In conclusion, while there are risks of health issues and decreased productivity associated with continuing to work after retirement age, I believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. Companies should assess individual capabilities and tailor roles to suit the health profiles of older employees, enabling them to remain productive and engaged in the workforce beyond retirement.
709;People think that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. Others believe that there are other alternative solutions for reducing crime.Discuss both views and give your opinion on this topic.;"Nowadays the sentences that judges give to criminals is always at the centre of attention of the society; some people think that the best way to reduce the amount of crime cases is to give longer prison sentences, while, others say that there are other alternative ways to stop it. This essay will talk about both views and, at the end, I will give my opinion about the argument.It is always more common to see long sentences for criminals, also if their crimes are not too bad to deserve that type of punishment; the reason why the court gives to them long sentences is because they think that staying a lot in prison will make the criminals understand that what they did is wrong and, next time, they will think twice before doing something bad or against the law.However long sentences can go against the human rights because they will take away from prisoners years of their life; for this reason, some people think that it can be better if, instead of stay close in a jail without doing nothing, they can be used in various works that will make them useful for the society and better person at the end of the sentence, like cleaning the city, helping old people in retirement homes and also cook for poor people.I think that there are other ways to stop crime instead of giving long punishments, also because everyone should have a second chance in their life and, more importantly, teach and show to prisoners different aspects of the community will help cities to become better places with less crimes to stop.This essay talked about two different types of views about crime sentences in our society, with my own opinion about the argument in the last part of it.";In today's society, the sentences handed down by judges to offenders have become a focal point of discussion. Some individuals believe that imposing longer prison terms is the most effective method for reducing crime rates, while others argue for alternative approaches. This essay will explore both perspectives and conclude with my own viewpoint on the matter.It is increasingly common for judges to issue lengthy sentences, even when the crimes committed may not warrant such harsh penalties. The rationale behind these extended sentences is the belief that a prolonged period of incarceration will help perpetrators recognize the wrongfulness of their actions, leading them to reconsider their choices in the future.However, long sentences can infringe upon human rights, effectively robbing inmates of valuable years of their lives. This has led some to advocate for alternative measures, suggesting that instead of being confined in prison without any constructive activities, offenders could engage in community service. This could include tasks such as cleaning public spaces, aiding the elderly in care facilities, and preparing meals for those in need, ultimately helping them to reintegrate as more productive members of society.In my opinion, there are more effective ways to combat crime than simply imposing lengthy sentences. Everyone deserves a second chance, and by exposing incarcerated individuals to various aspects of their community, we can foster environments that promote positive change and ultimately reduce crime rates.This essay has examined two contrasting viewpoints on the issue of criminal sentencing, concluding with my own perspective on the debate.
1286;People today find their lives more and more dominated by their jobs. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is certainly true that many people around the world find their lives dominated by the work that they have to do. This is shown when you realise how people’s work, and how much time, effort and resources they devote to it, is often the subject of conversation.Most people depend on their jobs to generate an income to pay for their lives’ necessities and luxuries, and so work can naturally become a dominating focus. As this is an important part of nearly everyone’s everyday life, it can seem that people’s lives are indeed becoming more influenced by their jobs. Whether this emphasis on work is more significant now than in previous years is debatable. In many developed countries around the world, there are procedures in place to help people with finding work, providing unemployment benefits, ensuring education, and offering pension payments. In times past, these provisions were not in place and a job or business was required to provide the necessary income.Therefore, in spite of increases in the cost of living in many places around the world, it can be argued there is actually less pressure than in previous years to keep one’s job and perform well at it. This, in turn, would lead to people’s lives being less influenced by their jobs today. It is also true that in the past, people were as responsible and focused on doing well in their responsibilities as today and so, in this respect, the people of the past would be equally dedicated to their work as people are today.While I agree that people’s lives today are often dominated by their jobs, I feel that the current situation is not necessarily worse than before. In fact, it may be more positive, due to the fewer pressures to earn money in many countries.;It's clear that a significant number of individuals globally find their lives heavily influenced by their professional obligations. This is evident in how frequently people discuss their work, alongside the time, energy, and resources they commit to it. Most rely on their employment to provide the income needed for both essentials and luxuries, which naturally elevates the importance of work in their lives. Given the centrality of work to many people's daily routines, it appears that jobs exert a greater influence than ever before.However, whether this emphasis on work is more pronounced now than in previous years is a topic open to debate. In numerous developed nations, systems exist to assist individuals in securing employment, offer unemployment benefits, ensure educational opportunities, and provide pensions. Historically, these safety nets were lacking, and securing a job or running a business was critical for earning a livelihood.Therefore, despite the rising cost of living in many regions, one could argue that the pressure to retain employment and excel at it is less intense now than it was in the past. This could mean that individuals today experience less job-related influence in their lives. It’s also worth noting that people in previous eras showed the same dedication and responsibility towards their work as we do today.While I acknowledge that contemporary lives are often shaped by work commitments, I believe that the current situation may not be worse than it was in earlier times. In fact, it could be viewed more positively, as many people face fewer financial pressures in various countries today.

In contrast, men consumed 22% of their recommended intake in 2002, rising to 26% in 2006, and then dropping to 24% in 2010.Younger individuals, however, had much lower consumption rates, with figures of 11%, 18%, and 16% for the years 2002, 2006, and 2010, respectively. It is evident that UK residents had their highest daily intake of fruits and vegetables in 2006 compared to 2002 and 2010.
1402;Popular events like the football world cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The World Cup football and the Olympics are held worldwide with great national support and expectations. As a fan of those competitions, I agree with the idea that sporting events can be necessary for international relations and national unity, but only partially, because such events can have unintended effects on relationships between countries.First of all, the World Cup, Olympics and other international games work for easing tensions among different nations. For example, South and North Korea have football games regularly two nations a chance to understand each other . In the mid of North Korean supporters came to South Korea with the footballers and they were very excited during the sporting events. Even if it sounds ridiculous, many South Koreans were quite surprised at that moment when North Koreans shouted and cried during the match. We all realized that they were very normal sports fans even though they were occasionally very secretive. Through the sports, two divided nations could reduce their political and ideological tensions and could feel the patriotic unity.On the other hand, some sports matches can make international relations worse. For instance, football or baseball games between Korea and Japan are always big matches in two countries where . Sometimes, after the matches, the two rivals blame each other and their patriotic emotions explode in an aggressive way. scenario is that the troubles caused by losing games affect the players directly.;The FIFA World Cup and the Olympics are celebrated globally with immense national enthusiasm and expectations. As a fan of these events, I acknowledge that they can play a role in fostering international relations and enhancing national unity, albeit with certain limitations, as they may also lead to unintended consequences for diplomatic ties between nations.Firstly, major sporting events like the World Cup and the Olympics can help alleviate tensions among countries. A notable example is the football matches regularly held between South Korea and North Korea, which provide a platform for the two nations to connect. During these matches, North Korean supporters visiting South Korea expressed excitement and enthusiasm, much to the surprise of many South Koreans who witnessed North Koreans cheering and even shedding tears during the games. This moment highlighted their humanity and passion for sports, despite the political barriers that typically exist. Through such events, the two divided nations can diminish political and ideological strife, fostering a sense of shared patriotism.Conversely, some sporting contests can exacerbate international relations. For example, football and baseball matches between Korea and Japan often stir strong rivalry and national emotions in both countries. In the aftermath of these matches, tensions can flare as both sides may point fingers at each other, leading to an eruption of patriotic fervor that can turn aggressive. Additionally, the fallout from a loss can significantly impact the players involved, further straining the relationships between the nations.
913;Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:In the past, sporting champions used to be motivated primarily by the desire to win a match or to break world records. These days they are more likely to be motivated by prize money and the opportunity to be famous.What message does this send to young people and how does this attitude to sport affect the sports themselves?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;There were many sport competitions organized after the World-War II since the first Olympic games was held in Athena, in 1963, to bring the world together again. Previously, sport competition was seen as an opportunity for the athletes to break the world records for the pride of their home countries. However, nowadays, people are more inclined to win the match because of money reward and glory. I believe that young people should be more encouraged to achieve their goals to become a champion so that the value of sport competition would not be purely for commercial purpose.In the last decades, there have been a lot of sport competitions being held from national to global level. The athletes were trained by the supported teams to do their best to become the world champion. It was the pride of such athlete to win and see their national flags were rised after the match. Over the years, sport has become more commercial following its popularity to attract global audiences. Many athletes are paying more attention for the opportunity to win the match for commercial purpose. For example, one wants to become a famous soccer player so that they could become the ambassador of Adidas and get more income out of it.Due to the temptation for getting famous and having more money, there are people who choose to play unfairly during a competition. Instead of focusing on increasing their skills, they would cheat to win the game for money. For example, a soccer player may use thyroid injection for boosting their energy level even though it is strictly prohibited. Moreover, sport is not seen anymore to promote peace and solidarity among people from different cultural backgrounds but for the chance to get the superficial gloriness.To conclude, even if the motivation has shifted, the young people should learn to focus more on becoming a real champion and play fairly so that they can become the best athletes in thier expertise while the money and glory would follow them after.;Numerous sports competitions took place following World War II, starting with the first Olympic Games held in Athens in 1963, aimed at uniting the world once again. In the past, sports events were viewed as a chance for athletes to set world records and bring pride to their home nations. However, in today’s world, the focus has shifted more towards winning matches for financial rewards and fame. I believe it is essential to inspire young people to pursue their aspirations of becoming champions, so that the true spirit of sports competition is not solely reduced to commercial interests.Over the past few decades, countless sports competitions, from national to international levels, have been organized. Athletes receive support from their teams and train rigorously to strive for world championships, taking pride in winning and seeing their national flags raised in honor. As the popularity of sports has grown, commercialization has also increased, attracting global audiences. Many athletes now prioritize the financial opportunities that come with victory. For example, aspiring soccer players often aim for fame to become brand ambassadors for companies like Adidas, thus increasing their income.This allure of fame and wealth has unfortunately led some individuals to resort to unfair practices during competitions. Instead of honing their skills, they may cheat to secure victories for financial gain. For instance, a soccer player might use banned substances like thyroid injections to enhance their performance. Additionally, sports have shifted away from their original purpose of promoting peace and solidarity among diverse cultures, now often seen as a means to achieve superficial glory.In conclusion, despite the changing motivations, young athletes should concentrate on becoming true champions and competing fairly. By doing so, they can excel in their respective sports, with financial rewards and recognition following their efforts naturally.
903;Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:Some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by giving them extra money. This practice can act as an incentive for some but may also have a negative impact on others.To what extent is this style of management effective?Are there better ways of encouraging employees to work hard?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Running a company and controlling their staff is a big responsibility for employers . In general, employers should have a great vision about the future of their own company and how to improve it in a better way .To start with, some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by simply giving them more many. In addition, that practice can act as a good source of motivation, you can see that your hard work and your extra hours wasn't waste after all .On the other hand, this style of management may affect tha company and their community in a negative way . For example, the manager of the institution may be more focused on just one employee who's always have the extra credit for the work therefore the other employees work hard for nothing and that leave a bad idea that they clearly work for just having that extra money and rewards from the manager .Beside that, employees will be affected and their productivity will change and drop even more and all of that is a result on how the management of a company impact their work and their effort of doing more .To sum it up, all the members in that company worked so hard, a little credit for their effort and long hours of developing their company and rewards them for it won't do any harm . Not to mention, a manager can reward the staff of the institution by giving them a day or two off or basically a three hours break . Anything that make them really satisfied after their long and efficient work towards the developing of the company.;Managing a company and overseeing its employees is a significant responsibility for employers. To succeed, employers need to have a clear vision for the future of their business and strategies for enhancing it.One common approach some employers take is to reward staff members for their outstanding contributions, often through monetary bonuses. This practice can serve as a powerful motivator, demonstrating that hard work and extra hours are recognized and valued.However, this management style can also have negative repercussions for the company and its workforce. For instance, a manager who continually praises a single employee for their exceptional work may inadvertently demotivate others. When other employees perceive their efforts as overlooked, they may feel disheartened, believing that the pursuit of rewards is futile.Additionally, this approach can lead to a decline in overall productivity, as the morale of employees who feel undervalued diminishes. It highlights the crucial impact that management practices have on employees' motivation and their willingness to contribute.In conclusion, recognizing and appreciating the hard work of all employees is vital. Acknowledging their dedication through rewards—whether financial bonuses, extra time off, or short breaks—can significantly boost morale and satisfaction. Such gestures not only promote a positive work environment but also contribute to the ongoing development of the company.
897;Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime.Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In the UK and Australia, a jury is not provided with the defendant's previous criminal history. Some law representatives claim that this should be reverted, and the jury must be provided with this information beforehand. I fully agree with this statement since the jury will have a better understanding of the defendant's behaviour, and the final decision will be easier to understand for the audience.Having the jury the right access to the defendant's past criminal background, would provide the jury with enough information about the defendant's behaviour. This is because there are certain previous criminal behavioural patterns which allow a better profesional decision-making from the part of the jury. For example, a recent study of the Law's Practice of Melboune, has shown that around 77% of people who commit a crime, were involved in at least one criminal event in the past with similar characteristics to the current crime.On the other hand, if the jury has access to the defendant's past criminal history, it would be easier for the audience to understand the nature of the jury's final decision. This is because there have been cases in which the jury's final decision was not completely accepted by the audience or misunderstood. Therefore, providing the jury with enough criminal backgroud records of the defendant will make it clear to understand in beased of what or why the jury's final decision was made.In conclusion, in the UK and Australia, a jury does not have access to a defendant's previous criminal records, and some law representatives claim that this should be reverted. I fully agree with this statement since being provided with this documents will allow the jury a more understanding of the defendant's behaviour, and the final jury's decision will be easier to understand for the audience.;In the UK and Australia, juries do not receive information about a defendant’s prior criminal history. Some legal experts argue that this practice should change, asserting that jurors should be informed of such background details beforehand. I fully support this perspective, as it would enhance the jury's understanding of the defendant's behavior and make the reasoning behind their final verdict clearer to the public.Allowing juries access to the defendant's criminal history would equip them with crucial insights into behavioral patterns that can inform their decision-making. Research conducted by the Law Practice of Melbourne indicates that approximately 77% of individuals who commit a crime have previously engaged in at least one similar criminal act. Additionally, granting juries access to a defendant's past criminal records would help the public better grasp the rationale behind the jury’s decisions. There have been instances where jurors' verdicts were met with skepticism or confusion by the audience. By providing jurors with comprehensive criminal background information, it would become easier for the public to understand the basis of the jury's final decisions.In conclusion, the absence of access to a defendant's prior criminal records in the UK and Australia has drawn criticism from various legal representatives. I fully endorse the notion that juries should have this information, as it would lead to a more nuanced understanding of the defendant's behavior and facilitate clearer communication of the jury's verdicts to the audience.
1308;Professional sportsmen and sportswomen and professional entertainers can often command enormous salaries today and this situation reflects society’s dependence on being entertained.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is no secret that today’s entertainment industry is extremely popular, with nearly everyone being engaged at some time in watching TV shows, movies and sports games. The North American sports industry alone generates a massive $67.7 billion every year. With the present emphasis on entertainment, sportsmen and women and professional entertainers can earn enormous salaries, with figures in the millions for one game, appearance or film. This situation certainly does reflect today’s society’s obsession with entertainment.Many people argue that celebrities do not deserve such payment when work in other professions considered of equal or higher value to society is underpaid. A-list celebrities can make over $20 million per movie, whilst many average workers can barely make ends meet. Of course there are lots of people who say that there are better ways the money could be used, rather than allowing such a vast amount to go to just one person. This is a fairly naive point of view, though. So long as people wish to watch entertainment, advertising in turn will be present and the most watched celebrities will be able to earn high salaries, as their presence will ensure the high viewing figures the advertisers desire.Though celebrities and sportsmen and sportswomen often make very large sums of money, it can also be seen as unfair to say that they do not deserve it or propose their money be used for something else. While it is true that they did not find a cure for cancer or made a life-changing scientific discovery, their hard work and expertise created a product that the public wants to see and the high payment merely reflects their value.In conclusion, it is clear that today’s society is indeed a society obsessed with being entertained and the high salaries paid to those who entertain society clearly reflect this. The high payments, however, are not necessarily out of place or undeserved.;It's widely acknowledged that the entertainment industry is immensely popular today, with almost everyone engaging in activities like watching TV shows, movies, and sports events at some point. In fact, the North American sports sector alone rakes in an astounding $67.7 billion annually. With this strong focus on entertainment, professional athletes and entertainers can command substantial salaries, often reaching into the millions for a single game, performance, or film appearance. This phenomenon certainly highlights society's current fascination with entertainment. Many contend that celebrities do not merit such high compensation, especially when individuals in other professions, deemed equally or more valuable to society, remain underpaid. For instance, top-tier actors can earn upwards of $20 million per film, while many ordinary workers struggle to make a living. Additionally, numerous critics argue that there are more deserving avenues for this money rather than allowing it to accumulate in the hands of a few. However, this perspective may be somewhat simplistic. As long as audiences seek entertainment, advertising will thrive, allowing the most popular celebrities to command high salaries in return for attracting viewers that advertisers covet.While it's true that celebrities and athletes earn incredible sums, it seems unjust to claim they don't deserve their pay or to suggest their earnings should be redirected elsewhere. Although they may not have discovered a cure for cancer or made groundbreaking scientific advancements, their hard work and skill have resulted in products that the public eagerly consumes, and their compensation reflects that value.In summary, today's society clearly displays a deep-seated obsession with entertainment, as evidenced by the lofty salaries awarded to those who provide it. These high payments, while substantial, are not necessarily inappropriate or undeserved.
1311;Providing a national system in a country where the unemployed receive a regular payment only encourages people not to seek work and puts an unreasonable strain on a country’s financial resources.Discuss this statement and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;In modern day society, money is a driving force for nearly everyone. Most people aspire to be financially secure and to have the ability to live the life they want. However, not everyone is able to find paid employment, and for that reason in some countries around the world, governments have initiated a system where the unemployed receive a regular payment to enable them to survive. Some people believe it is an excellent idea, whilst others believe that it is exhausting a country’s financial resources.When looking at the positive aspects of this system, it can be said that it prevents individuals from having a private bankruptcy. When somebody becomes unemployed, he or she will have on-going costs such as rent for a dwelling, bills for water, telephone and electricity as well as the cost of food and several other things. Without a salary, this person will fall into debt, because they will be unable to cover these expenses. A national unemployment payment system will therefore prevent this person from losing nearly everything over time. Without such system, many people would become homeless and would potentially engage in criminal activities to survive. Therefore, one can say that this system is positive. Although stories are heard of people exploiting the system, usually the newly unemployed want to find a job fast in order to become financially independent again, meaning that the government does not have to support them for long.Although there are positive aspects of this system, one can also say that if the payment made by the government is too high, it will prevent people from looking for work actively. Occasionally, the payment people receive is higher than their potential salaries, deterring them from working and creating an on-going cost for the government. A potential solution for this could be providing free training and employment support to open up new career opportunities with higher income, which would motivate this group to re-enter the workforce.In conclusion, the unemployment benefits system has positive and negative aspects. Personally, I believe that the positive effects of the system outweigh the negative. The payment must remain on a level that helps people survive without regular salaries, but does not seem attractive to exploit over a longer period of time.;"In today's society, money plays a pivotal role for almost everyone. Many individuals strive for financial stability to live the life they desire. However, not all individuals can secure paid employment, prompting some governments around the globe to establish a system that provides regular payments to the unemployed to help them make ends meet. Opinions on this initiative are divided; some view it as a beneficial measure, while others argue it depletes a nation's financial resources.On the positive side, such a system helps individuals avoid personal bankruptcy. Unemployment brings ongoing expenses, such as rent, utilities, and groceries. Without a paycheck, individuals risk accumulating debt as they struggle to manage these costs. A national unemployment benefit system can therefore protect individuals from losing everything over time. Without this safety net, many might find themselves homeless or resorting to crime for survival, which underscores the system's value. While there are instances of individuals taking advantage of the system, most newly unemployed individuals are eager to find work and regain financial independence, minimizing the time they rely on government assistance. Conversely, one could argue that if government payments are too generous, they may discourage active job searches. In some cases, unemployment benefits exceed potential wages, which can disincentivize individuals from seeking employment, inadvertently leading to ongoing costs for the government. A possible remedy could be to offer free training and job support, creating new opportunities with higher wages that would encourage individuals to rejoin the workforce.In summary, the unemployment benefits system presents both advantages and disadvantages. Personally, I believe that its positive impacts outweigh the negatives. It is essential for these payments to support individuals in sustaining themselves without regular salaries, while also ensuring they do not become overly attractive for long-term reliance."
1314;Public health is becoming an urgent issue nowadays. Some argue that governments should create nutrition and food choice laws to improve public health, while others believe that it is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Public health has become an increasingly pressing issue in the modern world, with many populations facing rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related diseases. This has led to a debate as to whether governments should establish nutrition and food choice laws for the betterment of public health or if it solely falls on individuals to make wise choices. In my view, everyone should take ownership of their diet and assume responsibility for their health because it is the right choice.The argument for government-imposed nutrition and food choice laws is that they could help prevent people from making unhealthy choices which could lead to more serious illnesses down the line. For example, government regulations could limit the amount of sugar or fats allowed in food products, especially those marketed to children, and impose taxes on unhealthy snacks like chips and candy bars. This approach would also benefit those who lack the knowledge about healthy food, necessary to make informed decisions. By providing clear guidelines on what foods are healthy, and by taxing the unhealthy options higher, the government would steer individuals away from unhealthy options.However, there are also some valid arguments against governmental intervention. These types of regulations infringe upon individuals’ right to choose what they put in their bodies. After all, everyone should be free to make lifestyle choices for themselves. Additionally, there may not be enough evidence to suggest that overly restrictive regulations would have beneficial effects on public health outcomes in the long run. Since people’s love of unhealthy food is often considered an addiction, it is unlikely that a higher price or other warnings would be enough to deter individuals from purchasing unhealthy food items.In conclusion, while there can certainly be benefits associated with implementing nutrition and food choice laws at a governmental level, ultimately it should still come down to personal choice and responsibility as far as one’s diet is concerned. Governments should instead focus on providing citizens with better nutrition education, so that they can make better informed decisions about what they consume. This way, they can receive the information they need while still having autonomy over their own diets and lifestyles.;Public health has emerged as a critical concern in today’s world, with many communities grappling with increasing rates of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related illnesses. This situation has sparked a debate over whether governments should implement laws regarding nutrition and food choices to improve public health or if individuals should bear sole responsibility for making informed dietary decisions. I believe that people should take charge of their diets and be accountable for their health, as this is a fundamental responsibility.Proponents of government-mandated nutrition and food choice regulations argue that such measures could help prevent individuals from making unhealthy decisions that could lead to serious health issues in the future. For instance, government interventions could limit the levels of sugar and fat in food products, particularly those aimed at children, and impose higher taxes on unhealthy snacks like chips and candy. This strategy would also aid those who may lack the knowledge necessary to make healthy food choices. By establishing clear standards for nutritious foods and taxing unhealthy alternatives, the government could guide individuals away from poor dietary options.On the other hand, there are compelling arguments against governmental intervention in personal food choices. These regulations may infringe upon individuals' rights to choose what they consume. Everyone should have the freedom to make their own lifestyle choices. Moreover, there may not be sufficient evidence to suggest that overly restrictive regulations would yield positive public health outcomes in the long term. Given that many people have a strong attachment to unhealthy foods, it is questionable whether higher prices or warning labels would effectively discourage them from buying these items.In conclusion, while implementing nutrition and food choice regulations at the government level can have potential benefits, personal choice and responsibility should ultimately take precedence when it comes to diet. Rather than imposing restrictions, governments should concentrate on enhancing nutrition education for citizens, empowering them to make informed choices about their diets. This approach would provide essential information while preserving individuals' autonomy over their meals and lifestyles.
267;Reporting of crimes and other kinds of violent news on television and in newspapers can have adverse consquences. This kind of information should be restricted from being shown in the media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Reporting violent crimes and other violent issues could represents a adverse consequence sometimes. Overall, it is important to enphasyded that people are geting more and more violant and we can't blame only media as a mainly factor for those behavior.This kind of questions is almost a phylosical one and we will keeping this doubt for a long time, or even never now if people are becoming more agressive because they are more expousure to this kind of news, or if we are having more report regarding to violence just because people are getting more violent.I believe that people could feel estimulated to be a criminous person when they have a minimium certain that they won't be punish.For instance, stolen and other minimius crimes had increase at california region after they anounced that stolen under tham $1000 are consider a crime anymore. So the sensation that people could do anything wrong and that is no penalty for that, estimulates the number for stolen.In other hand, when we see some hardly rules the number of crime are dipest low, as we can see at Dubai, for instance. As all penalties are really hard and strongly implemented this place is considering highest safe.I bilieve that restricting any kind of information be showen in the media doesn't solve the problem, and, in fact, bring another new problem related to limited population information. When people know what are happening, type of crimes, etc, they could be prepare to handle with those problems and prevent theirselves.;"Reporting violent crimes and other related issues can sometimes have negative consequences. It is crucial to emphasize that people are becoming increasingly violent, and we cannot solely blame the media as the primary factor behind such behavior. The question of whether individuals are becoming more aggressive due to increased exposure to violent news or whether more reports of violence are simply a reflection of rising aggression is almost philosophical. This dilemma may remain unresolved for a long time.I believe that individuals may feel encouraged to engage in criminal behavior when they are reasonably certain they will not face punishment. For example, after it was announced that thefts under $1,000 would no longer be considered a crime in California, there was a noticeable increase in thefts and other minor crimes. This perception that individuals can commit wrongdoings without facing consequences tends to stimulate criminal activity.On the other hand, stringent laws often lead to lower crime rates, as demonstrated by Dubai, which is considered one of the safest places in the world due to its strict penalties that are rigorously enforced. I believe that restricting the flow of information in the media will not solve the problem; in fact, it may create another issue related to limiting public awareness. When people are informed about the types of crimes occurring, they are better prepared to deal with potential issues and take preventive measures to protect themselves."
1;Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Poverty represents a worldwide crisis. It is the ugliest epidemic in a region, which could infect countries in the most debilitating ways. To tackle this issue, rich countries need to help those in need and give a hand when possible. I agree that there are several ways of aiding poor countries other than financial aid, like providing countries in need with engineers, workers, and soldiers who would build infrastructure. Building universities, hospitals, and roadways. By having a solid infrastructure, poor countries would be able to monetise their profits and build a stronger and more profitable economy which would help them in the long term. Once unprivilged countries find their niche, the major hurdle would be passed and would definitely pave the way for much brighter future. However, I do disagree that financial aid does not solve poverty, it does if used properly and efficiently. The most determining factor if financial aid would be the way to go, is by identifying what type of poor countries' representative are dealing with. Some countries will have a responsible leader and some will not, with that being said, implementing a strategy, to distinguish responsible leaders from others, would tailor the type of aid rich countries could use. An example, A clear report and constant observation would be applied to track the progress and how this type of aid is being monetized. In summary, types of aid varies from country to another, and tailoring the type of aid is of paramount importance to solve this problem that had huge toll on poor countries.;Poverty is a global crisis, representing one of the most distressing epidemics that can severely impact nations. To address this challenge, wealthier countries must extend their support to those in need whenever possible. I believe there are various ways to assist impoverished nations beyond just financial assistance, such as providing skilled engineers, laborers, and military personnel to help build essential infrastructure like universities, hospitals, and roads. By fostering a strong infrastructure, these nations could effectively harness their resources and develop a more robust economy, which would yield long-term benefits. Once disadvantaged countries identify their strengths, they will overcome significant obstacles, leading to a more promising future.However, I disagree with the notion that financial aid is ineffective in alleviating poverty. When managed properly and efficiently, it can indeed have a significant impact. The key to determining the suitability of financial aid lies in understanding the leadership situation in each country. Some nations may have responsible leaders, while others may not. Thus, implementing a strategy to differentiate between capable and irresponsible leadership is essential for tailoring the type of assistance richer countries can provide. For instance, a detailed report and ongoing monitoring could be established to assess progress and ensure that financial aid is being effectively utilized.In conclusion, the types of aid required differ from one country to another, and customizing assistance is crucial for addressing the profound issues faced by impoverished nations.
1381;Schools should select students by their academic abilities, agree or disagree?;Some people think that schools should select students according to their academic abilities, while others believe that it is better to have students with different abilities studying together. Discuss both views and state your own opinion.Some people contend that mixed ability classes are more beneficial for children’s development than streaming them on the basis of judgement about their academic abilities. However, from my perspective, I disagree with this contention.Admittedly, mixed ability classes provide a better environment for children’s all-round development. In such classes, children with different abilities study together and in turn they can learn from one another. From example, a student, who is good at academic study but weak in dancing or painting, can learn how to dance or paint his peers. In this sense, mixed ability classes allow students to develop their abilities in different subjects instead of only academic abilities.Despite the argument above, I believe streaming students brings more benefits to teachers and students. As for teachers, separating children with better academic abilities from others facilitates effective teaching. This practice helps teachers to control their students more conveniently and easily. Compared with mixed ability in which teacher should consider students’ differences when they are using teaching methodologies, streaming makes this situation simpler. To be more specific, students are at the same level of academic ability in a class, and in turn teachers can use the same methodologies for them all. In this way, the narrower the spread of ability in the class, the more convenient the teaching can be.On top of this, enables students to learn in an effective way. According to students’ different abilities, they are taught in different ways that are more suitable for them. In the top streams, students use more difficult materials, therefore, they can learn more. In sharp contrast, teachers can explain the material more slowly to those in bottom streams. Under this circumstance, students with different academic abilities can study effectively and efficiently.In the final analysis, mixed ability classes are beneficial for students’ versatile development, but in my opinion, segregating students based on different academic ability is better for both teachers and students.The writer presented a balanced discussion of the topic, effortlessly delivered in a form of a fluent, well-written IELTS essay. The arguments and reasoning are laid out in a coherent, logical way. A wide range of vocabulary is used in this work. There are very few spelling errors that could have been caught in an additional round of proofreading (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). Keep up the good work! Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;Some individuals argue that schools should group students based on their academic abilities, while others believe it is more beneficial for students with varying abilities to study together. This essay will evaluate both perspectives and offer my own viewpoint. Many advocates of mixed-ability classes posit that such environments are more advantageous for children's overall development than segregating them according to academic performance. These mixed classes allow students of different skill levels to collaborate and learn from one another. For instance, a student excelling in academics but struggling with creative subjects like dance or art can benefit from the expertise of peers who are proficient in those areas. Consequently, these classes foster a broader development across various subjects rather than focusing solely on academic prowess.However, I contend that streaming students based on their academic abilities yields greater benefits for both educators and learners. For teachers, grouping students with similar academic capabilities enhances the effectiveness of instruction. This approach simplifies classroom management since teachers can tailor their teaching techniques to a more homogeneous group. In mixed-ability environments, educators must adapt their methodologies to accommodate a wider range of skills, which can be more challenging. When students share a similar level of ability, teachers can employ consistent strategies that facilitate learning for the entire class.Furthermore, streaming allows students to engage with material that is appropriately challenging for them. Higher-achieving students can tackle more complex concepts, while those in lower streams can receive more gradual and thoroughly explained instruction. This targeted approach enables all students to learn in a manner that is most effective for their respective abilities.In conclusion, while mixed-ability classes do promote diverse skill development, I believe that dividing students according to their academic abilities ultimately leads to more effective teaching and better learning outcomes for both teachers and students. The essay presents a well-balanced analysis of the topic, articulated fluently and coherently, showcasing a wide range of vocabulary. There are only a few minor spelling errors that could be corrected with additional editing. Overall, this essay appears to merit an IELTS Band 8 rating.
1337;Scientists believe that the world is in danger due to environmental changes. Some people say that personal lifestyle changes should be made to reduce the damage to environment, while others think that the government should do something to help. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Environmental problems are clearly something that is often discussed in today’s world. One part of the society claims that individuals should change their habits and lifestyle to improve the ecological situation. Others, on the other hand, believe that this issue should be solved on the governmental level. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and my perspective will be offered.It is hard to deny that human kind is responsible for the current environmental situation, and it seems impossible to achieve any noticeable result in this field without the participation of vast majority of individuals. For instance, a simple lifestyle change such as introducing the separation of household rubbish can make recycling projects more convenient and efficient. Moreover, consumers can reduce their usage of plastic items and, in turn, less plastic waste will contaminate the environment.However, many people still feel that the government has more tools to prevent environmental changes. One option that the authorities have is to discourage citizens from using personal vehicles by charging high taxes and additional fees. Moreover, politicians usually have access to resources to educate people about environmental problems and promote the most important ecological projects on all levels, ranging from special courses at schools to TV shows and websites related to this topic. Furthermore, it is a key responsibility of the government to protect the environment by spending state funds on research and modern equipment. Countries where legislation protects the ecology, for example Norway, have achieved visible results and overcame most environmental problems.In conclusion, I believe that a combined approach will work best to prevent or reverse environmental changes. A contribution of every individual is just as important as the intervention from the government in order to fix existing issues and save our planet for future generations.;Environmental issues are a prominent topic of discussion in today's society. One segment of the population argues that individuals must adjust their habits and lifestyles to enhance the ecological outlook. Conversely, others assert that addressing this issue should primarily fall to the government. This essay will explore both viewpoints and present my own perspective.It is undeniable that humanity plays a significant role in the current environmental crisis, and meaningful progress in this area seems unattainable without the involvement of a large majority of individuals. For example, adopting simple lifestyle changes, such as separating household waste, can greatly facilitate recycling efforts. Additionally, consumers can minimize their use of plastic products, which would, in turn, reduce plastic pollution in the environment.However, many believe that the government possesses greater resources to combat environmental degradation. For instance, authorities can discourage the use of personal vehicles through high taxes and fees. Furthermore, politicians often have the means to educate the public on environmental issues and promote vital ecological initiatives through various channels, including educational programs in schools and media campaigns. Moreover, it is the government’s responsibility to safeguard the environment by allocating public funds for research and advanced technologies. Countries with strong environmental protections, like Norway, have made significant strides in addressing environmental challenges.In conclusion, I believe that an integrated approach is the most effective way to prevent or reverse environmental changes. The contributions of every individual are just as crucial as governmental intervention in addressing existing issues and ensuring a sustainable planet for future generations.
1373;Senior managers should have higher salaries than other employees (agree/disagree);In many countries senior positions have higher salaries compared to those of young workers of the same company. Some people think this isn’t justified. Do you agree or disagree?While some believe that rewarding those in managerial positions with higher pay packets is appropriate, not everyone agrees with this view. Personally, I am leaning towards the latter position due to negative impacts caused by significant difference in salaries within a company.For one, executive officers should know that higher than sufficient salaries are not necessary. Indeed, the higher the remuneration they receive, the more likely the company to suffer from devoid of financial capability. Furthermore, they often gain powers that money can’t buy. For instance, they often make important decisions over how to make their company thrive. They are also entitled to allocate company’s budget and designate tasks to other workers. these non-financial entitlements, they should refrain from earning more than reasonable amounts as salaries.Unreasonably high salaries granted to the executives can also afflict other employees. In fact, it is foreseeable that many employees would feel powerless or even when they find out about the huge salary gap between the executive officers’ and theirs. Accordingly, some may leave the company, and others may go on to strike and demand a pay increase. However, those actions . Therefore, unfair salary systems like this would yield unhealthy working environment for both employers and employees.In conclusion, I oppose to those in managerial roles with obscene amounts of compensation because it can cost the company its prosperity and discourage other employees . Thus it is recommended for the company to decide on the salaries of executive officers and general workers by adopting a more motivating salary system.This is a good example of an IELTS Band 8 essay. The task statement is sufficiently discussed, and the writer’s arguments are relevant and well developed. There are only 2 body paragraphs, but they are coherent and help to organise the information. Linking words are used appropriately to sequence ideas. Skillful use of synonyms throughout the essay demonstrates the writer’s vocabulary. Some of the expressions used aren’t entirely suitable or accurate, but there aren’t many of them. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.0.;In numerous countries, individuals in senior management positions tend to earn significantly higher salaries than their younger counterparts within the same organization. While some argue that this disparity is justified, I disagree and believe it can lead to detrimental consequences resulting from substantial salary differences among employees.Firstly, executives must recognize that exorbitantly high salaries are often unnecessary. In fact, the more substantial the compensation they receive, the greater the risk that the company may face financial constraints. Moreover, executives hold decision-making powers that cannot be purchased with money. They play a critical role in determining the strategic direction of the company, manage the budget, and delegate responsibilities to other staff members. Given these inherent advantages, it seems unreasonable for them to command salaries that far exceed what is considered fair.Excessive executive salaries can also have a negative impact on other employees. It is reasonable to expect that many employees might feel disheartened or even demoralized upon discovering the vast salary gap between the executives and themselves. This feeling of powerlessness could lead to higher turnover rates, as some may choose to resign, while others could resort to striking or demanding increased pay. Such reactions would create a toxic work environment, ultimately harming both employers and employees alike.In conclusion, I oppose the practice of awarding exorbitant salaries to those in management, as it can undermine the overall health of the organization and discourage the workforce. It would be beneficial for companies to establish a more balanced and motivating salary structure for both executives and general employees. This essay exemplifies an IELTS Band 8 response. The task is thoroughly addressed, and the writer's arguments are relevant and well-developed. Although composed of only two body paragraphs, they maintain coherence and effectively organize the content. Appropriate linking words are used to connect ideas fluidly, while a skillful range of vocabulary is evident throughout. Although there are a few instances of less suitable phrases, they are minimal. Overall, this essay is deserving of an IELTS Band 8.0 rating.
1357;Should employers pay more attention to personal qualities rather than qualifications?;"While recruiting a new employee, the employer should pay more attention to their personal qualities, rather than qualifications and experience. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and include relevant examples.Recent decades have witnessed a burgeoning growth of numerous industries; therefore, recruiting the right person for the position is crucial to the development of enterprises. But how do we determine if a person is the best fit? Advocates of conventional recruitment methods opine that this candidate must have sufficient experience and qualifications needed for that job. Nevertheless, some people argue that candidates’ personal qualities cannot be ignored. In my view, both components are of equal importance.To begin with, the conventional approach of checking potential workers’ qualifications via their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, issued qualifications and certifications from authorised organisations is vital. Apparently, whenever we submit a job application, we are always required to attach a CV while a cover letter is optional. Without a decent qualification, even if that candidate’s personal characteristics are suitable, the enterprise will need to carry out lots of skill trainings eventually.On the other hand, occasionally during an interview some HR officers ignore the significance of assessing how candidates’ individual qualities can fit in the company. Employers should assess not only candidates’ qualifications but also their enabling skills, ethics and value propositions. The more an employee’s personal qualities fit in a company’s culture and values, the more he or she is motivated to contribute to that company’s vision. KPMG is a great example of evaluating candidates’ personal qualifications and skills by utilising a game-based assessment process, followed by a video interview. This methodology enables a comprehensive assessment, and is embraced by many companies nowadays.To summarise, employers should assess both personal characteristics and formal qualifications when recruiting people as each of these elements has its own vital contribution to make in talent-seeking enterprises.This response covers the topic well. The writer’s position is clearly expressed and supported by an example, the use of paragraphing makes this essay organised and easy to follow. Linking words are used appropriately. The use of complex sentences and advanced vocabulary is impressive. Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.";When hiring a new employee, employers should prioritize personal qualities over qualifications and experience.

1385;Should people spend a lot on weddings and birthday parties?;"Some people think that spending a lot on holding wedding parties, birthday parties and other celebrations is just a waste of money. Others, however, think that these are necessary for individuals and the society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Throwing parties can be expensive. While some people do not find these fancy gatherings worth what they cost, others believe such events are important to both individuals and the society.People choose to throw parties for a number of reasons. For starters, they can make better teams. Project kick-off parties are good opportunities to break the ice and help team members to know each other better. Celebrating a victory create a sense of success and belonging. Companies do not see parties as of money and allocate budget to support such events; moreover, they often leave good memories. From our own experiences, we all have happy memories of our birthday parties when we were little. Every family has great photos at family gatherings in their album. In addition, contrary to what some people believe that spending on parties is a waste of social resources, they actually create value, either by employing people in the party-planning business or by offering people better experiences.The popularity of parties, however, causes some tension in the society. They are hard on introverted people who find themselves uncomfortable in the crowd. This is a clinic symptom which psychologists call “social anxiety disorder”. There are other ways to celebrate important events that may have greater value for their cost. For instance, companies could send out gifts after successful projects and parents could take their children on family trips to celebrate birthdays.In my opinion, while a party is a form of social event that brings many benefits to individuals and the society, other choices should also be considered, either to cut spending or to relieve the stress of those who are not fond of crowded celebrations.This is a very good essay. Other than minor inaccuracies there are no problems (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). Seems to be worth IELTS Band 8.";Many individuals believe that spending significant amounts on celebrations such as weddings and birthdays is a waste of money. Conversely, others argue that these events are essential for both individuals and society as a whole. This essay will explore both perspectives before presenting my opinion.Organizing celebrations can indeed be costly. While some argue that such extravagant gatherings are not worth the investment, others see them as vital for fostering connections within individuals and the community. There are various reasons why people choose to host parties. First and foremost, they can enhance teamwork. For example, project kickoff parties serve as excellent opportunities to break the ice and help team members bond. Celebrating achievements fosters a sense of success and belonging. Companies often view these gatherings as worthwhile investments, allocating budgets for them, as they often create lasting memories. Many of us cherish joyful recollections of our childhood birthday parties, and family gatherings often result in treasured photographs. Additionally, contrary to the belief that funding such events is a misallocation of social resources, celebrations can generate value by supporting the party-planning industry and enhancing people's experiences.However, the prevalence of parties can also create social tensions. For introverted individuals, large gatherings can be daunting and provoke discomfort, a condition known in psychology as “social anxiety disorder.” Alternative methods of celebrating significant milestones may provide more value for the money spent. For instance, companies could express appreciation through gift-giving after successful projects, and parents might opt to take their children on special trips for birthday celebrations.In my view, while parties offer numerous benefits as social gatherings, it is important to consider alternative options to reduce expenses and accommodate those who do not enjoy crowded events.
1393;Should the same laws which prohibit the sale and consumption of heroin be applied to tobacco? Discuss.;Recently, a heated debate when a few reputable health organizations suggested the application of a similar act of heroin selling and usage prohibition . In this , I will analyze why the adoption of such a law could be a breakthrough in our youngsters’ safety, according to my vision.Firstly, tobacco does not differ much from heroin when it comes to the addictive effect. , the active ingredient in tobacco, exerts its effect by acting directly on smoker’s brain cells. Numerous experiments carried out by on animals, rats, proved that this toxic chemical does lead time to dependency, similarly to the effect experienced with .Secondly, the restriction on selling would surely show an instant decline in tobacco smoking. ” Having easy access to cigarettes puts a tremendous pressure, especially on teenagers,to resist such a temptation” Dr.Hisham , head of department at Alexandria Medical college , states firmly. “Giving the new generation the sense that the severity of smoking is to other lethal drugs usage be a life saving step, they will thank us for as they get older.” he continues.To recapitulate, applying of a futuristic law such as the suggested one will have a positive impact ,not only on young people’s health but on our society as a whole.;Recently, an intense debate emerged after several reputable health organizations proposed implementing a ban on the sale and use of tobacco, similar to existing prohibitions on heroin. In this discussion, I will explore why enacting such a law could significantly enhance the safety of our youth.Firstly, the addictive nature of tobacco is remarkably comparable to that of heroin. The active ingredient in tobacco interacts directly with the brain cells of smokers. Numerous studies conducted on rats have demonstrated that this harmful substance can induce dependency in a manner similar to that of other addictive drugs.Secondly, restricting the sale of tobacco would likely lead to an immediate decrease in smoking rates. “Easy access to cigarettes puts tremendous pressure, especially on teenagers, making it difficult for them to resist such temptation,” asserts Dr. Hisham, head of the Department at Alexandria Medical College. He further emphasizes, “Instilling in the new generation an understanding of the dangers of smoking akin to those associated with more lethal drugs could be a life-saving measure, and they will surely be grateful for it as they grow older.”In conclusion, the implementation of a forward-thinking law like the one proposed could have a beneficial impact not only on the health of young people but also on society as a whole.
1394;Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth with poorer nations by providing them with things such as food and education? Or is this the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens?;I think that wealthy nations should be required to share their wealth with poorer nations. at providing such things as food and education because of the three following reasons.Firstly, citizens of both wealthy nations and poorer nations are human beings. Therefore, we can not look at, hear of, or talk about people who lack food, education, without compassion and sympathy. Sharing wealth with poorer nations is not only a good deed but is also a .Secondly, many nations in Africa and Asia are poor. Famine, diseases, crime and illiteracy are killing the citizens of these countries. , many nations in Europe and America are rich. If there are no actions taken, this inequality will increase dramatically. Poor countries will become poorer while rich countries will become richer. As a result, the poorest countries will become slaves of the richest countries. So, sharing wealth is useful way to prevent people from that bad future.Thirdly, although sharing wealth with poorer nations is very necessarythis help should only stop at providing such things as food, medicine and education. Or else, poor nations may become dependent on the aid. They may lose enthusiasm to build their countries by themselves. Moreover, rich nations can take advantage of sharing wealth to interfere with the governance of poor nations’. This can’t be considered a humane action and should be prevented.In my opinion, sharing wealth with poorer nations has both a bad side and a good side. What we have to do is its bad side and its good side.;I believe that affluent nations should be obligated to share their resources with poorer nations, particularly in the areas of food and education, for three main reasons. First, it is important to recognize that individuals in both wealthy and impoverished nations are human beings deserving of compassion and empathy. Witnessing the plight of those who suffer from hunger or a lack of education compels us to respond with kindness, making it incumbent upon us to share our wealth. Second, numerous countries in Africa and Asia face significant challenges such as famine, disease, crime, and illiteracy, which devastate their populations. In contrast, many nations in Europe and America enjoy prosperity. Without intervention, this growing disparity will only worsen, resulting in poorer nations sinking deeper into poverty while the wealthy continue to flourish. This widening inequality risks turning the most impoverished nations into effectively subservient states to the wealthier ones, making the sharing of resources a vital measure to avert such an unfortunate future. Third, while it is crucial to provide aid to poorer nations through essentials like food, medicine, and education, we must be careful to avoid fostering dependency. Continuous aid without limits can diminish the motivation for these countries to develop and sustain themselves. Additionally, wealthier nations may use their assistance as leverage to meddle in the governance of poorer countries, an act that is neither ethical nor humane.In conclusion, sharing wealth with poorer nations presents both positive and negative aspects. We must focus on mitigating the adverse effects while promoting the benefits of such actions.
1302;Social media has become a real problem for some young people today, and governments should create laws that allow only people over 18 years of age to have accounts.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Social media today is extremely significant to a majority of the population, especially the younger generation. Many teenagers find it exceptionally convenient and necessary for communication and entertainment. However, not everyone is able to use social media responsibly, which gave rise to the idea of making it accessible to only those older than eighteen years of age.Though there are negatives, such as cyber-bullying, or being too distracted by these modern media, there are issues surrounding most things in life. It is a choice to go onto a social media website, and many younger people are capable of managing accounts without any difficulties. It is not the government’s responsibility to monitor under eighteen-year olds; that is for the parents.Statistics show that over eighty per cent of teens use a form of online social media. It allows them to chat online, easily stay in contact with friends and family across the world, and see updates on others’ lives (through text, photos or videos). Social media is a way to express thoughts or ideas and to stay in contact with the rest of the world.To not permit one of the largest Internet-using demographics to use social media because a few people have problems with it is an irrational and an unfair restriction. Not only would profit be lost with fewer users, but controlling who creates accounts and monitoring proof of age would be difficult as well. I believe that laws should not make social media inaccessible to young people under eighteen; this would be unnecessary and absurd.";"Social media holds significant importance for a large portion of the population, particularly among younger individuals. Many teenagers find it not only convenient but also essential for communication and entertainment. However, the misuse of social media by some users has sparked discussions about limiting access to those over eighteen. While issues such as cyberbullying and distraction from studies are real concerns, every aspect of life carries its challenges. Ultimately, engaging in social media is a personal choice, and many young individuals demonstrate the ability to manage their accounts responsibly. It is not the government's duty to oversee the social media activity of those under eighteen; that responsibility lies with parents. Statistics indicate that over eighty percent of teenagers engage with some form of online social media. It provides a platform for them to chat, stay connected with friends and family around the globe, and share updates on each other's lives through texts, photos, and videos. Social media serves as an outlet for expressing thoughts and ideas while maintaining connections with the world at large.Limiting access to social media for one of the largest demographics of internet users due to the issues faced by a few is both unreasonable and unfair. Such restrictions could lead to significant losses in user engagement and create challenges in verifying the age of new account holders. I firmly believe that laws should not render social media inaccessible to individuals under eighteen; doing so would be unnecessary and irrational."
771;Society is based on rules and laws. If individuals were free to do whatever they want to do, it could not function. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?;It is commonly held that society can operate perfectly by a set of rules. It means that providing total freedom to people undoubtedly results in chaos with the further possibility of total collapse. I strongly agree with this point of view as I am in the opinion that rules play a significant role in creating a stable society. In this essay, this idea will be discussed in detail.Basically, a set of rules can be helpful to achieve productive results in such essential areas as medicine and construction. For example, it is necessary to develop common procedures of operations in surgery or traffic rules for public transport. Unless there are not standardized, it might cause a lot of deaths or at least injuries. Constructing also should be based on common processes because comfort and safe accommodation is a necessity for many people. Although there are people who consider rules and laws limiting and imposing, it can be argued that they are critical in the organization of humanity.Laws are not obstacles on the way to people's freedom because they are established to regulate formal relationships when it is difficult to find a compromise informally. Moreover, they are vitally important when people face crime and violence. Without any system of justice solving crimes becomes more challenging. All criminal accidents tend to be out of control and spread around the world immediately. Shoplifting, robbery, and even disastrous wars can plunge our world into darkness. This way humanity might face total chaos where morals values and behavioral patterns are neglected. In this context, the word ‘society’ risks becoming totally meaningless, as its main definition is a 'group of people with common traditions and rules.'From the arguments presented above, one may conclude that any society needs standards, laws, or even moral principles. They form a foundation for safety, a good level of medicine, and science that allows to create a strong society and manage any difficulties or threats that may disturb people’s well-being.;"It is widely believed that a society can function optimally when governed by a set of rules. This suggests that granting complete freedom to individuals can lead to chaos, potentially resulting in total societal collapse. I strongly support this perspective, as I believe that regulations play a crucial role in fostering a stable society. This essay will explore this idea in depth.A clear framework of rules is essential for achieving effective outcomes in critical fields such as healthcare and construction. For instance, standardized procedures are vital in surgical operations, just as traffic laws are necessary for public transport. Without these standards, the risks of injuries or fatalities rise significantly. Similarly, construction must adhere to established norms to ensure that homes are safe and comfortable for everyone. While some may view rules and laws as restrictive, it can be argued that they are indispensable for organizing human interaction.Laws should not be seen as hindrances to personal freedom; rather, they are necessary to regulate formal relationships in situations where reaching a compromise informally becomes challenging. Additionally, they are crucial in addressing issues of crime and violence. A lack of a justice system complicates the resolution of criminal acts, allowing offenses to escalate and spread rapidly. Incidents like theft, robbery, and even catastrophic wars can lead society into turmoil. In such a scenario, the concept of ‘society’ may lose its meaning, as its essence is defined by a group of individuals sharing common traditions and rules.In conclusion, it is evident that every society requires standards, laws, and moral principles. These elements provide a foundation for safety, a high standard of healthcare, and scientific advancements, all of which contribute to building a resilient society that can effectively manage challenges and protect individual well-being."
1352;Some believe the government should take care of retirees, while others think everyone should save for their own retirement (opinion);Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.It is true that when people advance into their golden years, they require more help and attention. For that reason, a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly. However, I tend to agree with those who argue that workers should be saving a portion of their income to have a nest egg in their retirement.To begin with, a culture of saving rather than depending on the government may foster the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government. As a result, the government would be able to release more funds to more productive purposes, such as development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which may expedite the overall progression of a country.In addition to economic factors, putting money aside has some personal benefits. Since savings-oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses, this may instill a sense of self-respect and pride in them. On the other hand, those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma, as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society. Hence, to live a life with dignity and pride, taking responsibility for funding one’s own retirement is evidently a better option from individual perspective.In contrast, the provision of monetary outlays for retirees has proven unfeasible in many countries. Since in many nations the number of senior citizens is on the rise, in the long run governments are likely to struggle to sustain the cost of providing for the elderly. The early signs of this have been seen in many countries that were forced to raise the retirement age, including my home country where men can now retire at the age of 67 instead of 65. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, these kinds of support may become completely unsustainable.In conclusion, the provision of state monetary support may undoubtedly lessen the concern of retirees to some extent. However, considering the issue of sustainability of this provision, it is better to opt for individual savings from the very beginning of working life, for the benefit of both individual and national development.This response addresses all parts of the topic, by discussing the merits of funding one’s own retirement versus relying on government pension. The writer’s opinion has been stated as well and is very clear. The neat presentation of ideas has been helped by appropriate paragraphing, and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay. The author’s vocabulary seems to be rich and there is a variety of sentence structures used in this essay. Overall, this essay deserves an IELTS Band 8.;Some individuals assert that the government should support the elderly financially after they retire, while others argue that it is the responsibility of individuals to save during their working years to prepare for their retirement. I align more closely with those who advocate for personal savings as a means to secure one's financial future in retirement.Firstly, fostering a culture of personal savings instead of relying on government support can significantly contribute to a nation’s economic growth. When individuals create their own retirement funds, it reduces the financial burden on the government. Consequently, the government can redirect its resources towards more productive initiatives, such as improving infrastructure, enhancing industrial capabilities, and expanding healthcare services, which can ultimately accelerate the overall development of the country.Moreover, saving for retirement also provides personal advantages. Those who prioritize savings tend to have a greater sense of independence, self-respect, and pride. In contrast, individuals reliant on government assistance often face societal stigma, as many view them as less capable or unworthy. Therefore, taking charge of one's financial future not only enhances personal dignity but also fosters a stronger sense of self-worth.On the flip side, providing government financial support for retirees has shown to be an impractical solution in numerous countries. With the growing population of senior citizens, many governments may struggle to sustain their pension systems in the long run. This reality is already manifesting in several places where retirement ages have been increased, including my own country, where men can now retire at 67 instead of 65. Thus, it is likely that sustaining such financial support may become increasingly difficult in the future.In conclusion, while state financial assistance can alleviate some concerns for retirees, the sustainability of such support raises significant concerns. It is more beneficial for both individuals and national development to prioritize personal savings from the outset of one’s career. This approach allows individuals to secure their own financial futures while also contributing to a more robust economy. This response comprehensively addresses the topic by evaluating the advantages of self-funding retirement against the reliance on government pensions. The author's stance is clearly articulated, with well-organized ideas presented in coherent paragraphs. The vocabulary is diverse, and the essay employs various sentence structures effectively. Overall, this response is indicative of a high level of proficiency and could be rated an IELTS Band 8.
1398;Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree that this is the right course of action? Give reasons for your opinion.;, organization and companies as well as governments impose restrictions in work places and public amenities. It has become fashionable in the world today . I feel that smoking can be harmful, but I don’t think it should be forbidden completely. I would also argue that people should have the whether or not they should smoke.Allow me to present the three positive sides of smoking. Firstly, smoking certainly helps many people to relax. For some, it even improves concentration. If someone is upset or they have , to smoke to reduce the pressure or tension. people like to smoke when they are relaxing with friends. Secondly, governments throughout the world make huge profits from taxes on cigarettes. The income obtained through taxes provides funds which are used for building and public places such as parks, gardens, sports ground and foot paths. Thirdly, tobacco industry also employs tens of thousands of people all over the world, particularly in poorer countries such as Zimbabwe or the Philippines. Without cigarettes, these people would have no jobs.Despite these positive are lots of negative effects to smoking too. Initially, smoking has been proven to be very dangerous for health. cigarette contains more than 4000 chemical substances, therefore, it dangerous diseases such as heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis or lung cancer. According to a recent report in Britain close to 3,500 people are killed each year in road accidents and 120,000 are killed by smoking. Furthermore, smoking costs governments millions of dollars because of the large number of people who need treatment in hospitals for smoking-related problems. Moreover, passive smoking is also a major concern today. Recent research shows that non-smokers can suffer from health problems if they spend long periods of time among people who do smoke. In the UK children whose parents are are three times as likely to start smoking themselves .In short, I think the world would be a better place without cigarettes. However, the decision of whether smoke or not to smoke should be for each individual to make. I suggest that people should not smoke in a room or a place where there are non smokers, however they should be free to smoke elsewhere.;Organizations, companies, and governments have implemented restrictions in workplaces and public spaces, becoming a trend in today's world. While I acknowledge that smoking can be detrimental to health, I believe it shouldn't be completely banned. Individuals should have the freedom to decide whether or not to smoke. Here are three arguments in favor of smoking. Firstly, smoking can provide relaxation for many people, and for some, it enhances their concentration. When individuals are feeling stressed or upset, they often turn to smoking as a way to alleviate their tension, especially when socializing with friends. Secondly, governments worldwide benefit significantly from the taxes imposed on cigarettes. This revenue funds public services, including parks, gardens, sports facilities, and walkways. Thirdly, the tobacco industry employs tens of thousands of individuals globally, especially in developing nations like Zimbabwe and the Philippines, where many livelihoods depend on this sector. Without the tobacco industry, countless jobs could be lost. However, despite these positive aspects, smoking has numerous negative effects. It is well-documented that smoking poses serious health risks, as cigarettes contain over 4,000 chemical substances linked to diseases such as heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis, and lung cancer. A recent report from the UK indicated that while around 3,500 people die in road accidents annually, smoking claims approximately 120,000 lives each year. Moreover, smoking imposes significant financial burdens on governments due to the costs associated with treating smoking-related health issues. Additionally, the dangers of passive smoking are a growing concern. Research indicates that non-smokers can suffer health problems if they are frequently exposed to secondhand smoke. In the UK, children with smoking parents are three times more likely to start smoking themselves. In conclusion, while I believe that the presence of cigarettes would contribute to a healthier world, the choice to smoke should ultimately rest with the individual. I propose that smoking be prohibited in areas where non-smokers are present, but smokers should have the freedom to smoke in designated spaces.
665;Some cities create housing areas by providing taller buildings. Others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. What solution is better?;Some big cities, especially in Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama in Japan tend to build taller buildings like skyscrapers. Other local cities and places where are scarcely populated are built wider. This is quite understandable in terms of space, and there might be some solutions to dissipate populations around Japan.Initially, the main reason why people tend to gather in big cities is that there are many opportunities to get a job. There are famous headquarter companies and branches that are based in foreign countries. Therefore, more and more people move to the big cities so that many taller apartments and buildings are built to let them live in the limited space. There seems to be stressful due to people being densely populated, but infrastructures are well organized, especially transport, medical care, and security.In contrast, the population in the countryside becomes less. Therefore, there is plenty of space to build houses in the wider area. It seems to be well-relaxed and comfortable to live in a slow-paced lifestyle. But, it is apparently more difficult to obtain a new job, and lacking transport, so they need to rely on cars. In addition, the number of hospitals is much smaller than big cities. These issues are long controversial as a first world problem.Finally, as Covid-19 spread worldwide, many people are started to work at home with a lap top computer. Innumerable companies adopted IT systems that are able to work remotely. In addition, some companies had already stated this systemized working style will not change, however, Covid-19 completely ended. This means that many people do not necessarily need to live in big cities. Therefore, if the transport system is well organized, especially establishing and improving a train, which works faster and more frequently. This effort will be not only helpful to dissipate the population outside of the big cities, but also promotive to tackling with great infrastructures to countrysides.In conclusion, as a result, the densely populated cities will be able to reduce its population and increase the population in the countryside. As a result, some issues will be resolved and become well-balanced solutions. Finally, it might be able to build wider houses in big cities with reasonable prices than now.;In Japan, major cities like Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama tend to focus on constructing taller buildings such as skyscrapers, while smaller towns and less populated areas are developed more horizontally. This trend is largely due to spatial considerations, and it opens up discussions about potential solutions for redistributing the population throughout Japan.The primary draw of large cities is the abundance of job opportunities. Many prominent companies and international branches are headquartered in these urban areas, attracting growing numbers of people. As a result, numerous high-rise apartments and buildings have been erected to accommodate this influx within limited space. While the high population density can create stress, the infrastructure in these cities—particularly in terms of transportation, healthcare, and safety—is generally well-managed.Conversely, rural regions are experiencing a decline in population. There, ample land is available for home-building, resulting in a more relaxed and comfortable lifestyle at a slower pace. However, job opportunities can be scarce, and public transportation may be limited, necessitating reliance on personal vehicles. Additionally, the availability of hospitals is far less than in urban areas, contributing to ongoing debates about the challenges faced in these less populated regions.The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a significant shift in work habits, with many individuals now working from home using laptops. Numerous companies have embraced IT systems that facilitate remote work, and some have indicated that this operational model will remain in place even post-pandemic. This evolution means that there is less need for people to reside in large cities. By enhancing transportation systems, especially through the development of faster and more frequent train services, it may be possible to encourage population dispersal from urban centers to rural areas. Such improvements could not only ease congestion in densely populated cities but also bolster infrastructure in the countryside.In conclusion, this shift could lead to a reduction in urban populations and a corresponding increase in rural populations. This transition may resolve some of the challenges associated with overpopulation and create a more balanced situation overall. Ultimately, it could pave the way for the construction of larger, more affordably priced homes in major cities.
11;Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Athletes to be on the top need to have high-end facilities that a country can provide for them to be able to improve their strengths and skills. Some government opted to build facilities exclusively for training athletes for international sports goals, instead of building establishments for everyone to have the liberty of using the sports facilities. From my perspective, this phenomena is a negative development.Being able to discover an individual's potential, they need to have a support from any form of sources. Establishing sports facilities can help people to discover their own interests, talents and even skills in learning new things. Centers which offer utilities, equipments and state-of-the-art tools that provide learning sports can be a great advantage to people who want to train themselves on the things that can awaken their interests when it comes to sports.In addition, building these kind of establishments, not only for the purpose to train top athletes, but also for people to immerse themselves to different variaties of activities can help them socialize more with their peers. This is extremely beneficial that aside from doing sports that they are into, they get to play along with peers, discover one's potential and also learning from one another. Furthermore, these individuals can also have the future to be one of top athletes that a country can have.In conclusion, although there are countries that chose to have their sports establishments exclusively for training top athletes, I assert that these that actions can be lead to negative feedbacks. Government should allow everyone the privilege to use and avail facilities that can hone an individual's talents, skills and dexterity when it comes to sports and this can also be immensely benefical for both country and citizen alike.;To be successful, athletes need access to high-quality facilities provided by their countries to enhance their strengths and skills. Some governments have chosen to build facilities solely for the training of elite athletes pursuing international sports goals, rather than creating venues that the general public can use. In my view, this trend is detrimental.To realize an individual's potential, support from various sources is essential. Establishing sports facilities can help people explore their interests, talents, and enhance their skills. Centers equipped with modern amenities and training tools can significantly benefit those looking to engage in sports, providing an opportunity to discover their passions.Moreover, creating these facilities for a wider audience—beyond just elite athletes—allows individuals to participate in a diverse range of activities, fostering socialization with peers. This is incredibly valuable as it not only enables participants to enjoy sports together but also encourages them to uncover their own potential and learn from each other. In addition, some of these individuals may eventually become top athletes themselves.In conclusion, while some countries have opted to restrict access to sports facilities for the exclusive training of elite athletes, I believe this approach can lead to negative repercussions. Governments should prioritize making these facilities available to everyone, nurturing individual talents, skills, and abilities in sports, which would ultimately be beneficial for both the country and its citizens.
725;Some educationalists say that every child should be taught how to play a musical instrument. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;It is commonly known that music has always played an important role in upbringing of children and a lot of parents wish their kids play a musical instrument. However, I disagree that this skill is essential to every pupil.First of all, not all people are born with a talent for music, which is essential if one wants to learn how to play it. Some people are natural musicians and succeed in this sphere with ease. On the other hand, there are children for whom learning to play is a hard work and, eventually, they might start hating music instead of enjoying it. Some people are bound to become excellent engineers or doctors and for them learning to read and play music is just a waste of time.Another important factor is that all kids are different and for that reason each of them desires to have a different hobby. If all pupils spent time on music, those who are not interested in it would have less time on things that are really exciting for them. Undoubtedly, everybody has a right to spend their free time in the way they want.What is more, playing a musical instrument is not considered to be an essential skill for a successful career. More time should be devoted to more important subjects, such as Math, Science and Languages. These have more chance to be useful for people when they grow up and graduate from school.To sum up, teaching all children to play an instrument wouldn't be a good idea. It should be taught only to those who really want it as not only would it ditract a child from subjects and hobbies which are more important in their opinion, but also it cannot be mastered by everybody.;It is well recognized that music has always been a significant influence in the upbringing of children, and many parents hope their children will learn to play a musical instrument. However, I believe that this skill is not necessary for every child.To begin with, not everyone is born with a musical talent, which is crucial for those who wish to learn an instrument. While some individuals naturally excel in music, others may find it challenging and over time, they may begin to dislike it rather than enjoy it. For some children, pursuing music might divert them from their true potential in fields such as engineering or medicine, making the effort to learn music seem like a waste of time.Moreover, each child is unique and therefore has different interests and hobbies. If every student devoted their time to music, those who are uninterested would miss out on activities that genuinely excite them. Everyone should have the freedom to spend their leisure time as they choose.Additionally, playing an instrument is not a crucial skill for a successful career. More focus should be placed on fundamental subjects like mathematics, science, and languages, which are more likely to be beneficial as students transition into adulthood and enter the workforce.In conclusion, mandating that all children learn to play a musical instrument is not advisable. It should be an option for those who have a genuine interest in it, as it may distract children from subjects and pastimes they value more, and not every child has the capacity to master music.
73;Some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The thought of some experts, is that people from rich countries are not satisfied by an ipotetical increase in their economy. In this essay I will discuss this point of view and I will explain why I am not sure I agree with that.It is generally believed by some professional figures, that additionals rise in economic wealth are not so crucial for a rich coutry. People from countries sush as Japan, the U.S.A, Switzerland or Cina are aware of their wide economic power and these governments offer a lot of benefits for their citizens. Thus, people have yet what they want, such as fundings for projects, well-organized cities, a lot of job opportunities. In fact, they do not fell a significant sense of satisfaction in the increase of their economy.Made this point, it is also true that some surveys used by The Italian University of Parma, reveal that citizens from coutries which a strong economy, are really grateful and satisfied by any additional rise, in the economic sector. As consequence due to this increase, they can ask more fundings for some start up or to improve the technology equipment in schools. Personally, I tend to think as a matter of fact that this is the right view. Because it is logical that more money mean more opportunities in any sector of the country. Hospitals, schools, museum and even historical buildings can have the possibility to obteind a lot of benefits.To conclude, in this essay I discuss the generel view of some experts about people from rich countries. I also explained why I strongly disagree with them.;Some experts argue that individuals in affluent countries are not significantly impacted by a hypothetical boost in their economies. In this essay, I will explore this perspective and explain why I am hesitant to fully agree with it.Many professionals believe that further increases in economic wealth are not paramount for wealthy nations. Citizens of countries like Japan, the USA, Switzerland, and China are well aware of their economic prowess, and their governments generally provide numerous benefits. As a result, people have access to many of their wants, including funding for projects, well-structured cities, and abundant job opportunities. Consequently, they may not experience a profound sense of satisfaction from a mere increase in economic growth.However, it is important to note that research conducted by the Italian University of Parma indicates that citizens in economically strong countries often express gratitude and satisfaction for any additional gains in the economic sector. Such increases can lead to more funding for startups or enhancements in technological resources within schools. Personally, I believe that this perspective is valid, as it stands to reason that increased funding translates into more opportunities across various sectors of the economy. Hospitals, schools, museums, and even historical sites can benefit significantly from additional resources.In conclusion, this essay examined the general viewpoint of certain experts regarding the perceptions of people in wealthy nations. I also articulated my strong disagreement with their stance.
1061;Some museums and art galleries charge admission fees, while others have free entry.Do you think the advantages of charging for admission outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many artistic places prefer to have an entry fee, whereas others let free access. I fully think that the benefits to have admission fees compensate the drawbacks to be not free.Many individuals would visit museum or art galleries if it were free which could attract more tourists. Unfortunately, admission charge decreases the possibility to discover paintings or masterpieces. However, before being a cultural place, art galleries are a place where numerous employees work. Indeed, if visitors had not to purchase the entrance, workforce would be not paid and the place would be not clean as museum should be. Moreover, huge museums as the British Museum have some sponsors to restore masterpieces whereas small museums have sometimes not the fundings and hence, admission fees would help it. Then, having an entry fee limit the number of individuals who do not really want to see art and appreciate the place.Concerning to cultural places, museum and art galleries know that many households could not afford ticket entrances for their offspring so many museums establish reduced price for teenagers and children. This project improves the relation between young people and the culture, then it allows children to be attracted to culture, partipate to the technical expenses behind the entry fee and after to visit again some cultural places when they will grow up and purchase the full price. Moreover, purchasing tickets help to the economy of the country which sometimes famous cultural places are a significant part of country's income. For instance, admission fees in museum are two third of the tourism's outcome in France.To conclude, I believe that admission fees should outweigh free entrance because it does not let the worth process of museum to work. Even if sometimes admission fees are costly for us, there is always a meaning behind the prices.;"Many artistic venues prefer to charge an entry fee, while others offer free access. I firmly believe that the benefits of having admission fees outweigh the drawbacks of not offering free entry. If museums and art galleries were free to enter, they would likely attract more visitors, including tourists. However, admission fees can limit opportunities for people to discover paintings and masterpieces. It's important to remember that art galleries, while cultural centers, also provide employment for many individuals. Without ticket sales, staff members would not be compensated, and the maintenance of these spaces could suffer, leading to a decline in the overall visitor experience. Additionally, larger museums like the British Museum often have sponsors to help preserve masterpieces, but smaller institutions may lack funding; in such cases, admission fees can be crucial for their sustainability. Furthermore, charging for entry helps filter out those who are less interested in engaging with art and culture.Regarding access to cultural venues, museums and galleries recognize that many families struggle to afford ticket prices. As a result, many offer reduced rates for teenagers and children. This initiative fosters a stronger connection between young people and culture, encouraging children to develop an appreciation for the arts and, in the future, to revisit these places and pay the full admission price. Moreover, ticket sales contribute significantly to the national economy, as major cultural attractions are often vital to a country’s income. For instance, in France, admission fees in museums account for two-thirds of the tourism revenue.In conclusion, I believe that admission fees are essential and should take precedence over free access, as they support the operational viability of museums. While some may find admission prices high, there is always a rationale behind the costs involved."
1355;Some parents encourage young people to leave home while others think they should stay with the family, discuss and give your opinion;Many parents encourage young people to leave home when they become older, while others think they should stay at home with the family. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.With the tremendous influence of modernisation, remarkable changes have taken place in the family structure to such an extent that nowadays, youngsters are motivated by their parents to live alone as they grow up. However, some people are of the view that it is more practical for a youngster to live with their family.On the one hand, there are many positive aspects to youths living away from their parents at young age. This provides the opportunity to young people to live a life on their own terms and make any decisions without the interference of their parents. Besides, living alone not only makes them independent but also makes them self-reliant, which is a crucial life skill to their successful career. For instance, managing all the house chores such as cleaning, paying bills, cooking and so on will make them well experienced at learning and managing diverse activities and will also boost their confidence.On the other hand, there is no denying the fact that youngsters living away from their family may find themselves in circumstances that may adversely affect their life. Naïve and inexperienced young people in the absence of parental supervision are more likely to fall prey to bad influence and dangerous activities, such as drugs or alcohol consumption, which may jeopardise their career or lead them astray from moral values. However, this situation is less likely to take place with youngsters still living with their parents. Besides, emotional bonding and family relationships can be maintained better if everyone is living together under one roof.In my opinion, although encouraging youngsters to live alone may lead them to learn various life skills, negative aspects and risks associated with living alone can far outweigh the benefits.This response covers the task topic well, by discussing the positive and negative aspects of living alone as a young adult, and the writer’s opinion has also been included. Paragraphing helps to present ideas in an orderly way, and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay. There is some repetitive use of the word ‘make’ in the first body paragraph, which could have been avoided. Apart from that, the writer’s vocabulary seems to be quite rich and allows them to communicate ideas precisely and clearly. Overall, this essay seems to be worthy of IELTS Band 8.;"Many parents encourage their children to move out as they reach adulthood, while others believe they should remain at home with their families. This essay will explore both perspectives and provide my viewpoint.In today's rapidly changing world, the family dynamic has shifted significantly. Many parents now inspire their children to embrace independence and live on their own as they mature. On one hand, there are several benefits to young adults living apart from their parents. Firstly, it allows them to lead their lives according to their own choices, free from parental control. Living independently fosters not only self-sufficiency but also essential life skills that are vital for success in their future careers. For example, handling responsibilities such as cleaning, paying bills, and cooking equips them with valuable experience and enhances their confidence.Conversely, there are undeniable drawbacks to young people living away from home. In the absence of parental guidance, inexperienced youths may find themselves in situations that can negatively impact their lives. They are more vulnerable to poor influences and risky behaviors, such as substance abuse, which could jeopardize their futures and undermine their moral values. In contrast, those who continue to live with their families are less likely to encounter such challenges. Additionally, familial ties and emotional connections are often stronger when family members reside together.In my opinion, while promoting independence in young adults can lead to the development of crucial life skills, the potential risks and negative consequences associated with living alone often outweigh these benefits. This essay effectively addresses the topic by examining both the advantages and disadvantages of young adults living independently, while also integrating the author's opinion. The use of paragraphs presents ideas clearly and logically, ensuring cohesion and coherence throughout. Although there is some repetitive use of the word ""make"" in the first body paragraph, the writer's vocabulary is rich and effectively conveys their ideas. Overall, this essay demonstrates a high level of proficiency consistent with an IELTS Band 8."
1335;Some people believe that excessive use of modern technologies, such as computers and smartphones, is negatively affecting the reading and writing skills of our young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Parents and teachers in many countries are feeling increasingly concerned about the effect of digital devices on vital skills of school-aged children. They are alarmed by the declining ability of young people to read and write and its suspected link to the influence of modern technology, and I wholeheartedly share their view. This essay will outline the reasons to watch out for the consequences of widespread use of computers and mobile phones by our youngsters.Primary school is a very important period when children develop their fine motor skills, which are involved in learning to write. Time spent typing on a mobile phone or a tablet doesn’t contribute to the necessary workout of the small muscles in the hands and fingers of young people. Not only do they get less practice in writing but also fewer opportunities to train in spelling words, since the ‘autocorrect’ and ‘autocomplete’ features use the first few letters to guess the entire word, therefore making it unnecessary for the child to remember and type it correctly. Another companion of unrestrained use of mobile devices is the jargon that is often used in text messages, where words are shortened or distorted. Exposure to ‘texting’ tends to replace the correct words with abbreviations in young minds, causing their spelling accuracy to decline.Reading is another casualty of unrestricted access to smart devices. Video content can be more appealing and immersive for kids and they often are automatically drawn to it instead of books. Reading requires regular practice and needs to become a habit in order to fully develop as a skill; however, it is being perceived as a boring and labourious activity by many youngsters compared to effortless video-watching. Easy and instant access to videos and movies pushes books further down the list of preferences of young audience, and it takes a significant commitment from parents and teachers to ensure that children continue to read books.To sum up, modern technology can be a friend or a foe for young children, depending on the choices adults in their lives make, regulating the amount of screen time and its purpose. Without due care the writing and reading abilities of kids can be harmed by other, more enjoyable activities they can use the devices for.";"Parents and educators across various countries are increasingly worried about the impact of digital devices on essential skills among school-aged children. There is growing concern about the diminishing reading and writing abilities of young people and the suspected correlation between these declines and the rise of modern technology. I fully support this sentiment. This essay will discuss the significance of monitoring the repercussions of the extensive use of computers and mobile phones among our youth.The primary school years are crucial for children as they hone their fine motor skills, which are essential for learning to write. However, the time spent typing on mobile phones or tablets does not effectively engage the small muscles in their hands and fingers, limiting their practice in writing. Moreover, features like 'autocorrect' and 'autocomplete' reduce the need for children to memorize and accurately spell words since these tools predict the full word based on just a few initial letters. Additionally, excessive use of mobile devices promotes a form of communication filled with jargon, where words are often abbreviated or altered. This exposure to ""texting"" can condition young minds to prioritize shortcuts over proper spelling, leading to a decline in their spelling proficiency.Reading also suffers due to unrestricted access to smart devices. Children frequently find video content more captivating and engaging, often gravitating towards it instead of picking up a book. Reading is a skill that requires consistent practice to develop; however, many children view it as tedious compared to the effortless enjoyment of watching videos. The immediate availability of videos and films pushes reading lower on their lists of preferences, making it essential for parents and teachers to motivate children to continue reading.In conclusion, modern technology can either benefit or hinder young children, largely depending on the decisions adults make regarding screen time and its intended use. Without careful management, children's writing and reading skills may suffer as they gravitate towards more entertaining alternatives that these devices offer."
877;Some people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime. Others believe that there are better ways to reduce crime. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;The increasing number of criminals are appeared in a society where some people advocate the longer incarceration resulting in a reduction of crime. However, some are divided and think that a number of better ways can help lessen the cases of crime. Which strategy should be taken to tackle this problem? This essay attempts to explore the view of both sides.An increase in the rate of crimes is a raising concerns in the community. A longer prison sentence seems to be the straightforward method to impede the crimes caused. In fact, a continuous incarceration is no room for offenders to commit the crimes in the community. This seemingly becomes an immediate achievement in the short term period. Some people deeply believe the mindset of criminals can be eliminated by the deterrence effect of the longer sentences which deprive of a person's freedom in life. In addition, it is generally recognized that the offenders have to be punished in effect of their guilty acts. The outlaws deserve a lengthening prison term in which they repent their offenses resulting in a decline in the number of crimes.Indeed, the incarceration can limit the offender's actions in a place at some points. However, it is not difficult to find there is a higher rate of reoffending upon release from prison across the countries. In 2013, the U.S.A. had a reoffending rate of 52% which prisoners reoffended within a year of release with a record of 49.2% in the U.K. The proportion of reoffenders occupied nearly a half of criminals. It reveals that the prison sentences is not a effective way to decrease the number of criminal cases. This implies that a decline in the crimes can be achieved araising from a decline in the likelihood of reoffending. Rehabilitation during the course of their sentence can be adopted to tackle this problems. These include direct therapeutic interventions to address the psychological causes of criminal behaviours as well as services to prepare offenderes to successfully reintegrate into the community after release. Those actions include the provision of academic programmes, vocational courses and employment opportunities.My take on this is that the incarceration alone is rarely considered enough in the control of criminal cases. A longer prison term only increase the financial cost from the government, but it cannot lower the likelihood of criminal offenses. The governments have to address the root factors causing offenses is the prime issue to reduce the crimes.;The rising incidence of crime has become a significant concern within society. While some argue for extended incarceration as a means to reduce crime rates, others believe there are more effective strategies to address the issue. This essay will examine both perspectives and propose potential solutions to this ongoing problem.The growing rate of criminal activity has sparked considerable worry among communities. Proponents of longer prison sentences argue that this straightforward approach can effectively deter crime. By keeping offenders incarcerated, they are removed from society and unable to commit further offenses, which may lead to immediate short-term reductions in crime. Some firmly believe that lengthy sentences can alter the mindset of criminals, as the loss of freedom serves as a powerful deterrent. Furthermore, there is a general consensus that offenders should face consequences for their wrongdoing, and longer prison terms are seen as a means for them to reflect on their actions, potentially leading to a decrease in criminal behavior.However, while incarceration may restrict an offender's actions temporarily, statistics indicate a high rate of recidivism upon release. For instance, in 2013, the United States reported a reoffending rate of 52% within one year of release, while the United Kingdom had a rate of 49.2%. Nearly half of all released prisoners reoffend, highlighting that increased prison sentences alone do not effectively reduce crime rates. This suggests that addressing the root causes of criminal behavior may be more effective in minimizing reoffending. Implementing rehabilitation programs during incarceration can help address the psychological factors that lead to criminal behavior and prepare offenders for successful reintegration into society. This could include offering educational programs, vocational training, and employment opportunities.In my view, relying solely on incarceration is insufficient for controlling crime. Lengthening prison terms merely increases financial burdens on the government without significantly reducing the likelihood of future offenses. To effectively lower crime rates, governments must prioritize addressing the underlying factors that contribute to criminal behavior.
379;Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;This essay agrees on the need of that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities, but always under one premise: those students should have demonstrated their capability to comply with university studies successfully.There are countries, for example Scandinavian countries, where their government helps students by giving them specific students' loans. These loans have special characteristics such as long loan terms and low interest rates. It is not for free, but at least a higher number of students can have access to upgrade their studies.And in many other European countries university fees are not large, so most of the students can access to bachelor studies. What it's not easy is having the needed qualification you need to access to the specific university study you want.If we talk in worlwide terms, university studies are limited to wealthy people.In fact I read only a couple of weeks ago that only a 17% of worlds' population have university studies. There is a contradiction between developped and non developped countries. As an example, in most countries in Europe we have too many university students. Actually they cannot find a job easily at their own country and sometimes they emigrate to another country in Europe or outside Europe. Furthermore vocational workers such as plumbers, waiters or receptionists can't be found, there no unemployment in vocational work!.The opposite happens in non developped countries. As university studies have large fees, almost nobody can access to them, and vocational workers suffer unemployment, so they need to emigrate to other countries to find jobs.To summarize, I believe fees should not be an obstacle to study in a university. The obstable should be your previous califications.Education and Health, as much as a country can hold them, should be available for all population, poor and wealthy, with non differentiation.;This essay supports the idea that governments should cover full tuition fees for students wishing to attend university, but this should be contingent upon the students demonstrating their ability to succeed in higher education.For instance, in Scandinavian countries, governments assist students through specific loans designed for education. These loans come with favorable terms, including extended repayment periods and low interest rates. While these loans are not free, they enable a larger number of students to pursue higher education.In many other European nations, university fees are relatively low, allowing most students to access bachelor's programs. However, the challenge lies in meeting the qualifications required for entry into the desired courses.Globally speaking, access to university education tends to be limited to those from affluent backgrounds. Recently, I read that only 17% of the world’s population has attained a university degree. This disparity creates a divide between developed and developing countries. In many European nations, there are an oversupply of university graduates who struggle to find employment, often forcing them to seek work abroad. Meanwhile, there is a significant demand for vocational workers, such as plumbers and waiters, with little unemployment in those fields.Conversely, in developing countries, high university fees prevent the majority from accessing higher education, resulting in vocational workers facing unemployment and the need to emigrate for job opportunities.In conclusion, I believe that tuition fees should not hinder access to university education. Instead, the criteria for admission should be based on prior qualifications. Education and healthcare should be accessible to all citizens, regardless of their financial status, without discrimination.
1428;Some people believe that having a pet such as a cat or a dog helps old people to live a more enjoyable life and to stay healthier. How do you think old people benefit from having a pet? Do you think there are any problems related to old people who have pets?;, and indeed, the importance of relationship between human beings and their pets has been proved to be slightly exaggerated in some nations. However, although problems regarding may affect the health conditions of old people, the benefits that these lovely animals bring to them, physically and mentally alike, are clearly undeniable.In of physical benefits, the well-being of elderly people with pets compared to those without pets, since not only do they have to take care of themselves, the responsibility ensure their one fed and well looked after encourages them to become even more active. Due to these extra activities, this might not have an obvious influence on their health, but at least this could help them to avoid bad . Coupled with physical side, their mental wellbeing will also be improved, and the reason is that having someone to take care of would reduce the chance of feeling . Therefore, their could be minimised.In spite of the above advantages, the interaction between pets and vulnerable old people still exist. One of the major concerns is the of these animal on their tracheas, especially those asthma. virtually invisible in the air, many asthma symptoms are caused unconsciously by pets. In addition to the fact that old people might experience difficulty in looking after their pets, as their health conditions are limited, could become even more when they try take care of others.In conclusion, it is true that obstacles still exist for elderly people in adopting pets, but the benefits of this topic its . For such reasons, instead of , further support would be far more beneficial.;The significance of the bond between humans and their pets has been somewhat overstated in certain countries. Nevertheless, while issues related to pet ownership can impact the health of elderly individuals, the advantages these beloved animals provide—both physically and mentally—are undeniably significant. In terms of physical benefits, elderly people who have pets tend to experience better well-being compared to those without. The responsibility of caring for a pet not only encourages them to take better care of themselves but also promotes their activity levels. Although the impact on their health may not always be immediately evident, these additional activities can help prevent negative health outcomes. On the mental health side, having a pet to care for can greatly enhance emotional well-being by reducing feelings of loneliness and isolation. This companionship can significantly lessen instances of depression and anxiety.Despite these benefits, challenges do exist when it comes to the interaction between pets and vulnerable elderly individuals. One major concern is the effect of pet dander on those suffering from respiratory issues, particularly asthma. Many symptoms can be triggered unconsciously by exposure to pets, as allergens can be nearly invisible in the environment. Furthermore, elderly individuals may find it increasingly difficult to manage the care of a pet due to their own health limitations, which could exacerbate their situation.In conclusion, while there are obstacles for elderly individuals considering pet adoption, the benefits are compelling. Instead of focusing solely on the challenges, providing additional support for seniors in pet ownership would be far more advantageous.
1300;Some people believe that homework should not be given to school children. Others, however, say that homework is an important requirement for children to be able to develop appropriately. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The benefits of giving or not giving homework to children are often debated. Some people feel that children have enough work to do during one day whilst at school, whereas others feel that the more work set, the better.It is true that schools today place more and more demands and pressure on children. The competition to do well, to enter a good university and to get a good job is significant. This has led to the ideology that children should do as much schoolwork as possible in order to help their intellectual development. The argument, however, that more is better is not always valid. There comes a point, especially for a child, when more knowledge cannot be absorbed in a day. When a child has possibly 7 or 8 classes a day on different subjects, he or she is processing a lot of information already. To give more work to be done at home, therefore, would be pointless and even counterproductive. In addition to this, although it is important to be educated, childhood should also be a time when there is an opportunity to just play and enjoy unstructured time. Homework can significantly lessen the possibilities of doing this.On the other hand, it can be argued that there is a place for homework. If study at school is not overdone, the opportunity to look at work again and extend ideas can be an invaluable exercise. It’s easy to forget one thing that has been taught once, but if that concept is revisited a second time, the brain has time to reprocess and likely better understand and remember.It seems to me that there is a place for homework for today’s children. What must be remembered, though, is that homework needs to be limited to age-appropriate parameters, so that a balance can be struck between study and free time and relaxation.;"The debate over the merits of assigning homework to children often sparks differing opinions. Some argue that students already have a full workload during school hours, while others believe that assigning more work enhances their learning. It's undeniable that modern education places significant demands on children. The drive to excel academically, gain admission to prestigious universities, and secure desirable jobs creates a competitive atmosphere. This has fostered the belief that maximizing schoolwork is essential for children's intellectual growth. However, the notion that ""more is better"" isn't always accurate. For children, there is a limit to how much information can be absorbed in a single day. With the average student attending seven or eight classes daily, they are already processing a substantial amount of information. Assigning additional homework in this context can be counterproductive and pointless. Furthermore, while education is crucial, childhood should also provide ample opportunities for play and unstructured time, which homework can significantly encroach upon.On the flip side, it can be argued that homework does have its place. If not overdone in school, revisiting material at home allows students to deepen their understanding and expand upon their ideas. Concepts taught once can easily be forgotten, but when revisited, they give the brain a chance to reprocess and retain the information more effectively.In my view, there is certainly room for homework in today’s educational landscape. However, it’s important to ensure that the amount assigned is appropriate for the child's age, creating a healthy balance between study, free time, and relaxation."
1369;Some people believe that preserving natural environment is crucial, but make no effort to do so (reasons and solutions);Some people believe that preserving natural environment is crucial, however, most make no effort to do so. Why do you think this is happening? What are some simple actions that could help the environment?It is commonly believed that preservation of natural resources is imperative, yet most people seem to exert no effort in doing so. Understanding the causes of this negligent attitude may help with devising some simple measures to safeguard the deteriorating environment.Lack of awareness is probably the foremost reason why the vast majority of individuals appears to be unmindful of the current environmental issues. Normally, people have tendency to downplay abstract problems, or those to happen in the distant future. This is because they are not properly informed of the possible detrimental effects of taking the environment for granted. To illustrate, residents in urban areas often deliberately dump their into the nearby creeks and drainage canals causing them to become clogged. It is only when devastating floods strike, that they come to realize the consequences of their actions.Some basic solutions that could be carried out are extensive awareness through all forms of communication and strict implementation of waste management. In addition to the traditional press, social media is a powerful means of disseminating information regarding the impending disasters and their potential hazards. This is a good way of persuading the public to actively take part in the campaign. Another straightforward solution, and by far the least anyone can do to help save the nature is disposing of garbage thoughtfully. Apart from avoiding throwing trash anywhere, everyone should practice proper segregation of biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and recyclable wastes at all times. These actions, when coordinated by the local governments, can be tremendously successful.In conclusion, while individual awareness is key to maintaining a healthy ecosystem, concerted efforts of governments and are much more effective in achieving such goal.The response is well written, it contains reasons, solutions and fully addresses the task. The ideas aren’t repeated, they are conveyed in a clear and easy to understand manner and organised well with sufficient use of cohesive devices. The vocabulary is varied, sentence structures are complex and instances of incorrect grammar are hardly noticeable. Overall, this essay is likely to achieve Band 8 in IELTS.;"Many individuals believe that protecting the natural environment is essential; however, the majority fail to take any action to contribute to this cause. What do you think is the reason behind this disconnect? What are some straightforward steps that could benefit the environment? It’s widely acknowledged that conserving natural resources is vital, yet most people do not make an effort to do so. Identifying the reasons for this apathetic attitude can help us formulate simple strategies to protect our declining environment.One primary reason for the general indifference towards environmental issues is a lack of awareness. Often, people tend to underestimate abstract problems or those that seem to only pose a threat in the distant future. This mindset arises from not being adequately informed about the potential harmful effects of neglecting the environment. For example, urban residents may carelessly litter into nearby streams and drainage systems, blocking them and worsening the situation. It is not until tragic flooding occurs that they recognize the implications of their actions.To promote environmental conservation, comprehensive awareness campaigns through various media and the strict enforcement of waste management policies are essential. Beyond traditional media outlets, social media serves as a powerful tool for spreading information about impending ecological disasters and their risks. It can effectively encourage the public to engage in these efforts. Additionally, one of the simplest yet most impactful actions individuals can take is to dispose of waste responsibly. Instead of littering, everyone should consistently separate biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and recyclable materials. When coordinated with local government initiatives, these actions can yield significant results.In conclusion, while fostering individual awareness is crucial for maintaining a healthy ecosystem, the collective efforts of governments and communities are far more effective in achieving this goal. This response is well-structured, providing reasons and solutions while fully addressing the prompt.

1322;Some people believe that the best way to solve environmental problems is to increase the price of fuel.Do you agree or disagree?;"Raising the price of car fuel is believed by some people to be an excellent method to solve the growing number of environmental issues. However, I strongly disagree with this idea, as doing so would make life difficult for lower-income households. While making fuel more expensive wouldn’t change the habits of wealthy families, switching to fossil fuel alternatives could prove to be much more beneficial for the environment.The most compelling reason against raising the cost of fuel is that the upper classes of society will hardly be affected by rising fuel costs, as this only makes up a minor proportion of their expenditure. They will continue to use their personal vehicles as they wish without a thought for the environment or the higher fuel prices, even if their country has state-of-the-art public transportation.Those who will feel the crunch of this decision are the middle-class and lower-income households, since travelling is a major part of most people’s routine, be it to work, school or shopping. Driving is almost unavoidable in many instances; therefore, raising the price of petrol would only serve to widen the gap between the rich and poor, and serve as an inadvertent form of discrimination.Another reason why increasing the cost of fuel is far from the best way to deal with environmental pollution is that now there are much more viable alternatives. Due to the rapid advances in technology, scientists and engineers have been able to develop several alternatives to fossil fuel, such as cars powered by electricity or naturally produced biofuel. The move to adopt clean energy sources instead of fossil fuels is a much more promising alternative compared to simply making fuel more expensive.In conclusion, I believe that governments of the world should invest more time and money in finding alternatives to fossil fuels that are more environmentally friendly, rather than simply raising the cost of petrol.";Some individuals believe that increasing the price of car fuel is an effective strategy to address the rising environmental challenges. However, I strongly oppose this notion, as it would disproportionately affect lower-income households. While wealthier families may not alter their fuel consumption habits, transitioning to alternatives to fossil fuels could significantly benefit the environment.The most compelling argument against raising fuel prices is that affluent individuals will experience little impact from such changes, as fuel costs represent a small fraction of their overall expenses. They will continue to use their vehicles without concern for the environment or the increased prices, even if they have access to advanced public transportation systems. In contrast, it is the middle-class and low-income families who will bear the brunt of this decision, as travel is integral to their daily lives, whether for work, school, or shopping. Since driving is often unavoidable, increasing gasoline prices would only exacerbate the divide between the rich and the poor, inadvertently creating a form of discrimination.Additionally, there are now more effective alternatives to tackle environmental pollution than merely raising fuel prices. Thanks to rapid technological advancements, engineers and scientists have developed various substitutes for fossil fuels, including electric vehicles and biofuels. Embracing clean energy options rather than just increasing fuel costs presents a far more promising solution.In conclusion, I advocate for governments worldwide to focus their time and resources on discovering and promoting environmentally friendly alternatives to fossil fuels, rather than simply hiking fuel prices.
1273;Some people believe that we cannot learn anything from the past for our life today, while others believe that history is a valuable source of information to understand human's life.Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is true that these days people say there is little we can gain from previous history, whereas others think that history is a key source to understand our lives. Although there are some strong arguments against learning history, I agree with learning history to know life of human.There are two reasons why people think there is nothing to gain from history. Firstly, there is evidence to support the idea that learning history stresses people out. Based on a survey conducted by Standford University, 57 percent of people consider learning past life of humans a primary source of stress, while less than 6 percent of people said studying previous humans' life was not a stressor. Secondly, people may not have time to remember historical events because the constant stimulation and hustle and bustle of society is holding them back from their life. In turn, they are more likely to regard learning history as useless.Despite the negative drawbacks, I support that historical event is great information to comprehend human's life. The main benefit of a historical event is that it can have a positive impact on people, especially children, as they grow up. Since history has more connection and support to our lives, it allows children to become more insightful and knowledgeable and discover advanced perspectives. For example, I have been widening my perspective through historical events in my family or country because gaining history regarding my family and nation taught me the right attitude to understand today. However, if I did not know any history, I would not have had an opportunity to understand human life and self-development. So, learning history should be encouraged.In conclusion, while I recognize the possible disadvantages of learning history, I believe that the benefits of gaining past events far outweigh them in the long term.;Today, there is a prevailing belief that little can be learned from history, while others argue that it serves as a crucial resource for understanding our lives. Despite some compelling arguments against studying history, I firmly believe that learning about the past is essential for grasping the human experience.There are two main reasons why some believe history offers little value. Firstly, evidence suggests that studying history can be a source of stress. A survey from Stanford University indicated that 57% of respondents find learning about human history to be a significant source of anxiety, with fewer than 6% asserting that it is not stressful at all. Secondly, the relentless pace and distractions of modern life may lead individuals to neglect historical knowledge, causing them to view the study of history as irrelevant.Nonetheless, I believe that learning about historical events provides valuable insights into human life. One of the key advantages is the positive influence it can have on individuals, particularly children, as they develop. History is deeply interconnected with our present lives, enabling children to become more perceptive and knowledgeable, encouraging them to explore broader viewpoints. For instance, my understanding of my family and national history has expanded my perspective, teaching me important lessons about the present. Without this knowledge, I would have missed the opportunity to comprehend human life and foster my own personal growth. Therefore, encouraging the study of history is essential.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the potential downsides of learning history, I maintain that the long-term benefits of understanding past events far surpass any disadvantages.
1342;Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military, while others disagree (opinion);Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military. Others think that women are less suitable for this kind of job. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Sample EssayIn recent years gender equality in employment has been the topic of heated debate. While some may argue that women are less suited for certain jobs such as with the police or the military, I believe that female candidates should be treated the same as their male counterparts.Those who consider women to be unsuited for some kinds of jobs including the police or the military often hold that opinion because such jobs are extremely physically demanding. As the female body has smaller muscles and less physical strength compared to male body, women may have difficulty engaging in strenuous activity which can be exhausting even for men. In military service, female soldiers are more likely to struggle while defending themselves than their male peers when they are forced to move around carrying heavy firearms in the battle, which can increase their risk of mission failure. Because of the hazards and extreme conditions they may encounter, some people advocate that women are not suitable for work in these fields.Nevertheless, I believe that female applicants should be considered for police or military placements without a gender bias, because women are more suited to certain tasks. In the police service, female officers can perform important roles on some occasions such as a body search where male officers are restricted from touching female convicts. In the military service, female nursing staff are more likely to care better for injured soldiers since maternal instinct makes them dedicated and heart-warming professionals. Furthermore, for the sake of fairness to all, job seekers should have an equal opportunity to choose their jobs freely, regardless of gender. Many women have the desire to work in the police and the military and some of them have relevant expertise and qualifications. Therefore, they should not be discriminated against in employment opportunities for these jobs.In conclusion, although some say that women are incompatible with police and military duties because of the high physical demands, I believe that they should be treated as equal to men. This is because there are certain roles with the police and the military that are more suitable for women than men, and therefore both genders should have equal employment opportunities.;"The issue of gender equality in employment, particularly in fields like law enforcement and the military, has sparked considerable discussion. While some argue that women are less suited for these roles, I contend that female applicants deserve the same consideration as their male counterparts.Proponents of the view that women may not be fit for certain positions, such as those in the police or military, often cite the physically demanding nature of these jobs. They point out that women typically possess less muscle mass and physical strength than men, which could make it challenging for them to handle strenuous tasks. For instance, in combat situations, women might find it harder to navigate the challenges of movement and carrying heavy equipment, potentially jeopardizing mission success. Given the demanding conditions and risks associated with military service, some believe that these factors render women less suitable for these roles.On the other hand, I believe that women should be evaluated for positions in law enforcement and the military based on their individual abilities rather than their gender. Women can excel in specific roles that require skills or perspectives uniquely suited to them. In police work, female officers can fulfill crucial duties, such as conducting body searches of female suspects, which male officers are often prohibited from doing. In the military context, women in nursing roles may provide exceptional care for injured personnel, as their nurturing instincts can enhance their professional dedication. Moreover, it's essential to ensure fairness in the job market; every individual should have the freedom to pursue their desired career without gender prejudice. Many women are eager to join the police or military and possess the necessary qualifications, so they should not face discrimination in these fields.In summary, while there are arguments suggesting that women may struggle with the physical demands of police and military jobs, I firmly believe they should be regarded as equals to men. Certain responsibilities within these roles may align more closely with the strengths of women, emphasizing the need for equal employment opportunities for all genders."
1376;Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research (discuss);Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research for the benefit of human beings, while others argue that it is wrong. Discuss both views and give your opinion.People have different views on how medical research should be conducted and tested. Although many people support the use of for developing medicines, I personally believe that animal testing is morally wrong.The main reason why some people value to conduct medical research is because animal testing has contributed to many life-saving cures and treatments. It is true that nearly every medical breakthrough in the last 100 years has resulted directly from research using animals. For example, experiments in which dogs had their pancreases removed led directly to the discovery of insulin, critical to saving the lives of diabetics. Furthermore, it is impossible to release to the market before proving it no harm to humans and laboratory mice are appropriate research subjects because they are similar to human beings in many ways.However, I people who consider medical development that involved the use of animals cruel and unacceptable. I believe that the lives of all creatures should be respected and we, humans, have no right to for our own benefits. Governments should invest in developing alternative methods that can replace when doing medical research. For example, a software program can be developed to model a human immune system and new drugs can be tested on the software rather than animals. In this way, no animals will suffer from the medical tests and the society can still benefit from medical development.In conclusion, although it is undoubtedly true that animal testing has helped scientists in drug developments and medical discoveries, I believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused to animals and we should use alternative methods when doing medical research that do not involve animals suffering.This is a great essay. It addresses the two sides of the argument by exploring reasons why animals should and should not be used in medical research. The ideas are well explained and supported by examples. The use of paragraphing is efficient and helps with logical sequencing of ideas. Linking words are used appropriately to achieve the necessary cohesion. Author’s meaning is skillfully conveyed by the use of wide range of vocabulary. Even though there are some inaccurately used expressions, they don’t hinder understanding. Most sentences are error-free, instances of faulty grammar are rare. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;Some individuals argue that it is acceptable to utilize animals in medical research for the benefit of humanity, while others contend that such practices are unethical. This essay will discuss both perspectives before presenting my own viewpoint. Opinions vary on the ethical implications of conducting medical research involving animals. While many advocate for animal testing in the development of new medications, I personally contend that such practices are morally indefensible. Proponents of animal testing emphasize its significant contributions to vital medical advancements and life-saving treatments. Indeed, nearly every breakthrough in medicine over the past century has been achieved through research involving animals. A notable example is the experiments conducted on dogs, which ultimately led to the discovery of insulin, a crucial treatment for diabetes. Additionally, since it is essential to demonstrate that new medications are safe for humans before being released to the market, laboratory mice are often considered suitable subjects for research due to their physiological similarities to humans.Conversely, some individuals view the use of animals in medical research as cruel and unacceptable. I share the belief that all living beings deserve respect, and humans should not exploit animals for our own gain. Instead, governments ought to invest in alternative methodologies that do not rely on animal testing. For instance, software programs could be developed to simulate human immune responses, allowing researchers to test new drugs without subjecting animals to suffering. This approach would enable medical progress while ensuring that animals are spared unethical treatment.In conclusion, although it is true that animal testing has played a crucial role in drug development and medical breakthroughs, I maintain that the benefits to human health do not justify the suffering inflicted on animals. We should prioritize and advance alternative research methods that do not involve causing harm to animals. This essay effectively addresses both sides of the debate by thoroughly examining the arguments for and against the use of animals in medical research. The ideas are clearly articulated and supported by relevant examples. The paragraph structure is well-organized, enhancing the logical flow of the discussion. Linking words are employed effectively to ensure cohesion. The author conveys their message skillfully, utilizing a wide range of vocabulary. Despite some occasional inaccuracies in expression, the overall meaning remains clear, and the majority of sentences are grammatically correct, with few errors present. In summary, this essay demonstrates the qualities worthy of an IELTS Band 8 rating.
1057;Some people feel that entertainers such as film stars, pop musicians or sports stars are paid too much money.Do you agree or disagree?Which other types of job should be highly paid?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Jobs such as actors, musicians or athlete earns a lot of money, however, a part of people argued that these kinds of people are overpaid. In my opinion, I disagree with this view and believes that they deserved the high salary.People who works as a movie stars, musicians and sports player deserved high money paid. This is because they advocated all there time and effort to get the salary that they have today. Before they become famous, they only have few incomes or even get nothing. That is to say, many musicians did not get any payment at the begining of their career, so do the actors and sports players, they spent their time but do not get any money. For instance, before being a well-known musicians, they have to spend their own money on buying equipment to produce musics or to public the songs they have made. Also, the creativety and their works cannot be measured by money. Thus, they deserved high salary because of their profession and uncopyable works.Jobs which needs professional skills and the job envolves high risk shoul also be highly paid. Such as doctors and programmers, their job are unplaceable because these envolved professional knowledge that not everyone had. Moreover, people works in high-risk environment deserved high payment too. For example, fire-fighters, they might got hurt or even die while working. Therefore, higher salary is needed for jobs that need special skills and career with high risk.To sum up, I agree with the statement because of the reasons above, and jobs with special knowledge and people works in dangerous environment should also be highly paid.;"Careers such as those of actors, musicians, and athletes often come with substantial salaries. However, some people argue that these individuals are overpaid. I disagree with this perspective and believe that they deserve their high earnings.Individuals in entertainment and sports have invested significant time and effort to achieve their current level of success, and they are deserving of high compensation. Before reaching fame, many of them earned very little or nothing at all. For example, numerous musicians struggle without pay at the start of their careers, as do actors and athletes; they dedicate time and resources without immediate financial rewards. Many aspiring musicians invest their own money in equipment to produce music and promote their songs before they gain recognition. Additionally, the creativity and uniqueness of their work cannot be easily quantified in monetary terms. Therefore, their high salaries are justified given the nature of their professions and the originality of their contributions.Professions requiring specialized skills and those that involve significant risks should also command high salaries. This includes doctors and programmers, whose expertise is irreplaceable due to the specialized knowledge required for their roles. Furthermore, individuals working in high-risk environments, such as firefighters, deserve higher pay due to the dangers they face, which could result in injury or even death. Hence, increased compensation is warranted for jobs that require specialized skills and involve substantial hazards.In conclusion, I support the notion that individuals in specialized fields and those working in dangerous conditions should receive high pay, as explained in the points above."
1289;Some people feel that fashion is like art and a significant part of society, while others feel that fashion is a waste of time and money.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"The fashion industry today is an important component of society and people’s lives. It is true that many people care little for clothes and scorn the importance that others attach to them; however, this does not mean that the significance that people give to fashion is a waste of time and money.When one considers that areas of the world suffer from poverty, disease and inadequate access to food and clean water, the emphasis attached to fashion by the developed world can seem out of proportion. Many people would contend that the resources put into developing and creating fashion would be more ethically spent on creating some level of equality in terms of the right to live a healthy and happy life. This point is hard to argue with. However, it is also true that people in the developed world cannot be expected to send all their spending money to people in need and that wanting to look good is an unalterable human trait.The fashion industry contributes to the society much like most other industries. It provides jobs and income to millions of people around the world and the money that changes hands generates taxes that contribute to the fabric of society. There is more to fashion than trying to look better than others and excessive luxury. The high level of fashion is indeed a kind of art form and, like other art forms, there will always be people who appreciate it, want to create it and want to spend money on it. It is part of the development of civilisation and this is not likely to change.I therefore feel that, although the gap between the rich and the poor sometimes makes it seem that fashion is a waste of time and money and an unethical use of resources, fashion is an important part of today’s society and economic output. This leads me to believe that trying to strike a balance between selfish greed and a more altruistic way of living should be an individual choice.";"The fashion industry plays a significant role in modern society and the lives of individuals. While it is true that some people may dismiss the importance of clothing and overlook the value that others place on it, this doesn't imply that the significance attributed to fashion is frivolous or wasteful. In a world where many regions grapple with poverty, disease, and limited access to basic needs like food and clean water, the focus on fashion in developed nations can appear disproportionate. Critics often argue that resources devoted to fashion could be better utilized in efforts to promote equality and ensure everyone has the right to a healthy and fulfilling life. While this perspective is hard to refute, it is also important to recognize that those in developed countries cannot be expected to donate all their discretionary income to those in need, as the desire to present oneself well is an inherent human trait.The fashion industry, much like many other sectors, contributes to society by providing jobs and income for millions around the globe. The financial transactions within this industry generate taxes that help support the infrastructure of communities. Fashion involves more than just the pursuit of superiority or excessive indulgence; it can be seen as a form of art, appreciated by many who wish to create and invest in it. As part of our civilization's evolution, this dynamic is unlikely to change.In conclusion, while the stark divide between wealth and poverty can make fashion seem like an irresponsible use of resources, it remains a vital element of contemporary society and economic activity. Therefore, I believe that finding a balance between self-interest and altruism in our consumption choices should be a personal decision for each individual."
1294;Some people feel that learning a foreign language is an essential component of a child’s education. Others feel that learning a foreign language is often a waste of time that can be better spent on learning about technology and other more vocational subjects.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Throughout the history of education, learning a foreign language or languages has been a constant component. Of course, many people feel that this is really an unnecessary part of education for everyone, but this is not a point of view that I share.The opponents to learning a foreign language might argue that most people do not travel that often outside their own country. In addition to this, out of all the countries of the world, comparatively not many share the same language. Therefore, learning a foreign language will only be useful for the very limited time that one spends in a country where this language is used. For some people, the language might never be used in their entire lives. When one thinks about how much time and money are spent training language teachers, buying resources, going on trips and delivering lessons for such a negligible benefit, this would seem to be a very inefficient allocation of resources.However, the benefits of learning a foreign language go further than just the ability to use it from time to time on a holiday or business trip. Firstly, through learning one language, one gains an understanding to some extent of how all languages work. Thus, no matter where people might end up around the world, the knowledge of language can be of use. Secondly, with the study of a foreign language, one also opens oneself up to other cultures. This allows in turn an appreciation for different points of view and belief systems. With an ever-shrinking world due to globalisation, the ability to empathise and understand the people from other countries is vital to reducing conflict and creating a more tolerant society. Finally, quite simply learning languages is excellent for the improvement of general cognitive skills.It seems to me that learning a foreign language, therefore, is more than just gaining the ability to speak a few words of a foreign tongue. It is part of intellectual and social development and needs to be continued for everyone in today’s schools.;Throughout the history of education, the study of foreign languages has consistently been a fundamental aspect. While some may argue that language learning is unnecessary for everyone, I do not share that perspective. Critics often claim that most individuals rarely travel outside their own country, and among the multitude of nations worldwide, only a limited number share a common language. Consequently, learning a foreign language might seem only beneficial during brief visits to places where that language is spoken, leaving many people without any practical use for it in their lifetimes. Considering the significant resources allocated to training language teachers, purchasing materials, funding trips, and conducting lessons, it appears inefficient to invest so much for what some perceive as minimal returns.However, the advantages of learning a foreign language extend well beyond occasional use during vacations or business engagements. Firstly, mastering one language can provide insights into the workings of all languages, enabling individuals to apply their linguistic knowledge regardless of where they go. Secondly, studying a foreign language fosters a deeper connection to other cultures, encouraging appreciation for diverse perspectives and belief systems. In our increasingly interconnected world, the ability to empathize with and understand people from different backgrounds is crucial for mitigating conflict and fostering a more tolerant society. Finally, learning new languages significantly enhances cognitive skills.In my view, acquiring a foreign language encompasses much more than just learning a few words. It is an essential part of both intellectual growth and social development, and it should remain a priority in education for all students today.
1073;Some people feel that the design of newly constructed buildings in big cities should be controlled by governments. Others believe those who finance the construction of a building should be free to design it as they see fit.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is often argued that governments should involve in construction's design in huge cities, while others argued that governments do not have to retrict the free of designers' imagination if those designs are splendid fit on the cities. I believe that if that were to happen, it would be the positive development. This essay will highlight the both views and give personal opinion from the former argument's side.To begin with latter opinion, although governments have worried about the combination of buildings entirely, the strong limitation about design can cause squandering of designers' skills. There are huge number of competitions about designing building in this society, and the evolution in these fields has developed dramatically. However, if there is a strict criteria on design of building, the majority of intelligences do not need to hammer away to come up with revolutional outline for building.On the other hand, signitured design of the big cities by itself can be the purpose of trevelling as a landmark, and it can be followed by significant economical achievement in the country. To take myself as an example, in 2017, I went to Gold Coast for study automotive engineering, and I was stunnied becaused of the atmosphere which is formed by combination of similar buildings and beach. Furthermore, according to the research from Sydney university, Gold Coast is one of the cities which make a fortune because of marvelous view.To sum up with, I would therefore argue that in spite of the fact that building design restriction can influence on architects negatively, it has a potential ability to make a significant profit in the future.;There is ongoing debate regarding whether governments should play a role in the design of buildings in large cities. While some believe that government involvement can stifle designers' creativity, others argue that regulatory frameworks can enhance the overall architectural landscape. I contend that government involvement in construction design can lead to positive outcomes. This essay will explore both perspectives, primarily advocating for the former view.Beginning with the latter perspective, although the government is concerned about the harmonious integration of buildings within a city, imposing strict design limitations can stifle designers' creativity and talents. There are numerous design competitions in our society, reflecting significant advancements in architecture. However, if strict guidelines are enforced, many talented designers may feel less inclined to innovate and create groundbreaking structures.Conversely, iconic designs in major cities can serve as tourist attractions and contribute significantly to the economy. For example, when I visited the Gold Coast in 2017 to study automotive engineering, I was captivated by the vibrant atmosphere created by the harmonious blend of similar buildings and the beach. Furthermore, research from the University of Sydney indicates that the Gold Coast is a lucrative destination, largely due to its stunning vistas.In conclusion, while restrictions on building design may negatively impact architects, they also possess the potential to yield substantial economic benefits in the future.
1292;Some people feel that with the rise of artificial intelligence, computers and robots will take over the roles of teachers. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;With ever increasing technological advances, computers and robots are replacing human roles in different areas of society. This trend can also be seen in education, where interactive programs can enhance the educational experience for children and young adults. Whether, however, this revolution can also take over the role of the teacher completely is debatable, and I oppose this idea as it is unlikely to serve students well.The roles of computers and robots can be seen in many areas of the workplace. Classic examples are car factories, where a lot of the repetitive precision jobs done on assembly lines have been performed by robots for many years, and medicine, where diagnosis, and treatment, including operations, have also been assisted by computers for a long time. According to the media, it won’t also be long until we have cars that are driven automatically.It has long been discussed whether robots and computers can do this in education. It is well known that the complexity of programs can now adapt to so many situations that something can already be set up that has the required knowledge of the teacher, along with the ability to predict and answer all questions that might be asked by students. In fact, due to the nature of computers, the knowledge levels can far exceed a teacher’s and have more breadth, as a computer can have equal knowledge in all the subjects that are taught in school, as opposed to a single teacher’s specialisation. It seems very likely, therefore, that computers and robots should be able to deliver the lessons that teachers can, including various ways of differentiating and presenting materials to suit varying abilities and ages of students.Where I am not convinced is in the pastoral role of teachers. Part of teaching is managing behaviour and showing empathy with students, so that they feel cared for and important. Even if a robot or computer can be programmed to imitate these actions, students will likely respond in a different way when they know an interaction is part of an algorithm rather than based on human emotion.Therefore, although I feel that computers should be able to perform a lot of the roles of teachers in the future, they should be used as educational tools to assist teachers and not to replace them. In this way, students would receive the benefits of both ways of instruction.;As technological advancements continue to progress, computers and robots are increasingly taking over human roles across various sectors of society. This shift is evident in education, where interactive programs can enrich the learning experience for children and young adults. However, the question of whether these technologies can completely replace teachers remains contentious, and I argue against this notion, as it is unlikely to benefit students.In many industries, the integration of computers and robots has transformed the workplace. For instance, in automobile manufacturing, robots have long handled many repetitive precision tasks on assembly lines. In the medical field, computers have been utilized for diagnosing and treating illnesses, including performing surgeries. Media reports suggest that fully autonomous vehicles may soon become commonplace.The role of technology in education has sparked considerable debate. Current programs are sophisticated enough to adapt to a wide range of situations, potentially replicating a teacher's knowledge and responding accurately to students' questions. Indeed, computers can have a far broader knowledge base than a single teacher, covering all subjects taught in schools, rather than being limited to one specialization. This raises the possibility that computers and robots could effectively deliver lessons and tailor materials to meet the diverse abilities and ages of students.However, I remain unconvinced regarding the pastoral responsibilities of teachers. Teaching involves managing behavior and fostering emotional connections with students, helping them feel valued and cared for. Even if robots or computers could mimic these behaviors, students are likely to react differently when they realize such interactions are driven by algorithms rather than genuine human emotion.Therefore, while I believe that computers should play a significant role in education, providing support to teachers rather than replacing them, it is crucial that students benefit from a combination of both teaching methods.
1285;Some people like to own the place where they live, but other people like to rent where they live. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The debate over whether it is better to own or rent the property in which one lives is one that has strong supporters on each side. There are persuasive arguments for both points of view.One of the main advantages of renting a property is flexibility. Usually, a tenant only has to give a month’s notice before changing where he or she lives. If a property is owned and a change is needed, the property must be put onto the market and it is frequently a long and stressful process to get a sale completed. Sometimes, the wrong time of year or a bad market can mean that a sale is not possible. Another advantage of renting is that a large amount of a family’s capital is not tied up in the property. Property can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and often a lot more. If one rents, this money can be spent on other things to help improve the family’s quality of life. If the property is on a mortgage, then the deposit, also often very large, is tied up in the property and the pressure of having to make substantial payments every month can cause a lot of stress.Owning a property does have various advantages, though. Even though people usually have to service a mortgage every month with payments, this money is then built up with the property. With renting, the money is lost to the landlord, but at the end of the term of the mortgage, the whole property is owned by the family. This makes the process of living in a property a type of investment. In addition, the property’s value often goes up after time, frequently creating a substantial profit. Owning the property where one lives can also create a sense of well-being and self-actualisation.The decision to whether one rents or owns the property in which one lives really boils down to individual preference. My opinion is that it is much more preferable to own a property, mainly because it creates a valuable asset for the family.;The discussion surrounding the merits of owning versus renting a home has passionate advocates on both sides, each presenting compelling arguments. One of the primary benefits of renting is the flexibility it offers. Typically, a tenant only needs to provide a month's notice before relocating. In contrast, selling a property can be a lengthy and stressful process that may not go smoothly, especially if the market conditions are unfavorable. Moreover, when renting, a significant portion of a family's capital isn't tied up in real estate. Properties can cost hundreds of thousands, if not more, and renting allows families to allocate these funds toward improving their quality of life. Conversely, owning a home often involves tying up a substantial deposit and committing to large monthly mortgage payments, which can lead to considerable stress.On the other hand, homeownership comes with its own set of advantages. Although mortgage payments can feel burdensome, they contribute to building equity in the property. Unlike rental payments, which benefit the landlord, monthly mortgage payments ultimately lead to ownership of the home. Thus, living in a property can be viewed as a form of investment. Additionally, property values generally appreciate over time, potentially yielding significant profits. Furthermore, owning a home can foster a sense of stability and personal fulfillment.Ultimately, the choice between renting and owning a home comes down to personal preference. In my view, owning a property is typically more advantageous, primarily because it represents a valuable asset for the family.
1405;Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding changes. Others, however think that change is always a good thing. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;Nowadays, people are arguing whether an ideal lifestyle should be a stable one or should it include a wide ranges of changes.In my opinion, whether changes are needed should be determined the of you are at.Apparently, are favorable the development of young people, in to their careers. Primarily, an abundant experience in varieties of jobs enables the young to master a broad range of techniques and skills, leading to significant edge over counterparts in the competition for employment. Meanwhile, trying various roles in life and work provides wide of lifestyles for the young in the future. Only after this comparison can they realize what the real goals of their .However, other than frequent changes, the elderly who have undergone all these challenges may pursue a steady lifestyle. For the elders, concentration on their favorite activities would give rise to a sense of enjoyment and security, which is helpful to physical and psychological health. Due to a stable life, the elderly are less exposed to stress, leading to a decrease in adrenal hormones and resulting in their well-.Furthermore, degeneration of mental and physical function would make the elderly unlikely to adapt to external changes, causing and , which are not contributing to their health.Above all, it is unlikely to describe the changes in life with a positive or negative term. Accommodation for personal needs and goals is more important than the changes themselves.;Today, there is an ongoing debate about whether an ideal lifestyle should prioritize stability or embrace a variety of changes. In my view, the necessity for change depends on the stage of life you are in. For young people, experiencing diverse job opportunities is beneficial for their professional growth. Gaining a wide array of experiences equips them with essential skills and techniques, giving them a significant advantage in the competitive job market. Additionally, exploring different roles in both life and work allows young individuals to envision various lifestyles for their futures. This exploration helps them identify their true aspirations.Conversely, for older individuals who have navigated significant challenges, a more stable lifestyle can be advantageous. By focusing on activities they love, seniors often find a sense of enjoyment and security that promotes both mental and physical well-being. A stable lifestyle reduces exposure to stress, which in turn decreases the production of adrenal hormones, resulting in improved overall health. Moreover, the natural decline in mental and physical capabilities can make adapting to external changes more difficult for the elderly, potentially leading to stress and discomfort, neither of which is conducive to their health.Ultimately, categorizing life changes as purely positive or negative is not accurate. What truly matters is how well these changes align with personal needs and goals.
1423;Some people say education is the only critical factor to the development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;One the one hand good education is a highly recommended skill in the developed countries, on the other hand of many people in regions of poverty. But what makes education key factor for the development of a countryWe must acknowledge that education is something that we all need. The differences are just what we learn. Mostly the limited educational horizons of poor and less educated people have more to deal with their personal situation than with problems of bigger effects on a country. Attending school is sometimes too expensive and it does not feed a family.Nevertheless there must be a reason for education. For me it looks like some countries have realized that Education is the key for the globalization process. If we take India for example we can see that a change in the educational system had changed the economy of the country. country has changed from a poor region to a high potential for IT knowledge.In regard to this fact of education seriously and offer it to a wide range of people. Spending money education is the key tippy title=”for”]to[/tippy] a new future effects on the economy and social life. All in all I agree with the importance of education for the development of a country. Less knowledge leads to poverty and . Learning and Knowledge is Power and an investment in the near future and therefore it has to be an official task.;On one hand, a good education is highly valued in developed countries, while on the other hand, many individuals in impoverished regions face significant challenges in accessing it. So what makes education a crucial factor in a country's development? We must recognize that education is a universal necessity, though the content of that education varies. The limited educational opportunities available to those who are poor or less educated often stem more from their individual circumstances than from larger, systemic issues.In many cases, the costs associated with attending school can be prohibitive, and families may find it difficult to prioritize education when basic needs are at stake. However, the importance of education cannot be overstated. Some countries have come to understand that education is vital for participating in the global economy. Take India, for example: a transformation in its educational system has significantly boosted the country's economy, turning it from an impoverished region into a hub of IT expertise.Acknowledging this critical link, it is essential to prioritize education and make it accessible to a broader population. Investing in education is key to fostering a brighter future that positively impacts both the economy and social structures. Ultimately, I firmly believe in the importance of education for a nation's development. A lack of knowledge often results in poverty, while learning and knowledge empower individuals and transform societies. Therefore, promoting education should be a fundamental responsibility of governments and communities alike.
87;Some people say free time activities for children should be organized by parents. Others say that children should be free to choose what they do in their free time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Whether parents should fully intervene in their children's organization of their leisure time or let them decide it, remains a big discussion. In this essay I will contrast the two opinions and I will explain why I think a good balance is needed.One of the reasons supporting the first view is the idea of the undeveloped children's ability to organize. This is because, although some of them might seem very mature for their age, others might struggle understanding the importance of having a routine, besides playing video games. For instance, many parents orientate their children helping them to organize hobbies and teaching a very important skill, time managment.On the other hand, some people encourage children to decide themselves what to do as this stimulates creativity and personal growth. This view, therefore, opens a new world for the little ones who can decide whatever they like, having multiple options. For example, children in this situation quite often are supported when they want to play sports or participate in a painting class.In my opinion, parents should not only be envolved as much as they can in all aspects of their children's lives, but also they might encourage the little ones to have personal opinions and decision about their hobbies and leisure actitivities. This may be a good way to build trust and communication between parents and children. Moreover, children learn responsability while being guided by their parents.In conclusion, some parents help their children more in scheduling their free time, while others intervene less leaving them to create a routine freely. I believe, parents should always be involved in their children's lives and decisions, allowing children participation too, which brings multiple benefits to their relationship.;The debate over whether parents should fully control their children's leisure time or allow them to make their own choices is a significant one. In this essay, I will examine both perspectives and explain why I believe a balanced approach is essential.Proponents of parental intervention argue that many children lack the maturity to organize their time effectively. While some may appear advanced for their age, others often struggle to understand the importance of maintaining a routine beyond playing video games. For example, many parents guide their children in selecting hobbies and instill essential skills such as time management.Conversely, some advocate for allowing children to make their own decisions, as this fosters creativity and personal development. This perspective offers children the freedom to explore a variety of interests. For instance, children who are encouraged to choose their activities are frequently supported in pursuing sports or engaging in art classes.In my view, parents should not only be actively involved in their children's lives but also encourage them to form their own opinions and make decisions regarding their hobbies and leisure activities. This approach can strengthen trust and communication between parents and children, while also teaching children responsibility under parental guidance.In conclusion, while some parents assist their children more in planning their free time, others allow them greater autonomy in establishing their routines. I believe that parents should maintain an active role in their children's lives and decision-making, fostering a sense of participation that enhances their relationship and brings numerous benefits.
1330;Some people say that all popular TV entertainment programmes should aim to educate viewers about important social issues. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It is often said that all influential TV entertainment programs should be geared towards raising people’s awareness about social issues that matter. While some TV programs could be suitable for this purpose, I disagree with the view that it should be mandatory for all of them, as the decision whether to do so must take into account the nature of the TV content and the channel’s audience.There is a large group of professionals who would benefit from deepening their understanding of what is happening in the world. Stock traders and bankers, for example, must always keep track of numerous business trends on a global scale, and they would appreciate this type of information on their favourite TV shows. Young people are another suitable audience due to the fact that they enjoy learning about popular topics from TV programmes. For instance, SDGs or the Sustainable Development Goals has now become an important topic to learn for children at school. Educational TV would provide a welcome alternative to textbooks, making learning more fun.Despite the potential advantages of incorporating educational content in TV programs, it is important to remember that the purpose of entertainment TV is for people to escape reality, to take a break from their hectic lives. Being reminded about some troubling social issues would not be appreciated by those who just want to unwind after a long day at work. Another consideration is how the content is perceived by the audience, because broadcasting serious topics as part of a comedy show might lead some viewers to believe they are of lesser significance. This would make TV shows of light-hearted nature a poor choice for inclusion of content on pressing social issues.In conclusion, entertainment TV programs can be an effective form of education for some people and a great tool to spread information. However, not all of them should be used for this purpose as there are various ways people appreciate them.;"It is commonly stated that influential television programs ought to focus on raising awareness of important social issues. While some shows may effectively serve this purpose, I believe it should not be a requirement for all, as the decision should consider the nature of the content and the audience of the channel. Many professionals, such as stock traders and bankers, would greatly benefit from a deeper understanding of global events. These individuals need to stay informed about various business trends and would value relevant information integrated into their favorite TV shows. Additionally, young audiences, who enjoy learning about significant topics through television, could also benefit. For example, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have become crucial educational content for schoolchildren, and incorporating educational programming could make learning more engaging than traditional textbooks.However, it is essential to keep in mind that the primary aim of entertainment television is to provide an escape from reality, allowing viewers to relax after a long day. Reminders about challenging social issues might not be welcomed by those seeking a break from their daily stresses. Another factor to consider is how serious topics are presented; introducing them in a comedic context may lead some viewers to perceive them as less important, making light-hearted shows an unsuitable platform for addressing pressing social matters. In conclusion, while entertainment television can serve as an effective educational tool for some and help disseminate valuable information, it should not be mandatory for all programs to take on this role, as audience preferences for content vary widely."
1353;Some people say that arts subjects are as essential as academic ones and should be part of school syllabus (agree/disagree);"Some people say that art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are an essential part of education, and every school should include them in its syllabus. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your opinion and examples from your own experience.Art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are fundamentals that enrich our lives. However, some parents say schools on teaching more academic subjects, such as mathematics, science, literature and history. In my opinion, both academic and arts subjects should be taught and I will expand on the pros and cons of including arts in the school program further on in this essay.On the one hand, academic subjects are often required when we get into higher . Academic subjects may be considered as in the academic world. Personally, I have never taken an entrance exam of art subjects for high school or university. In other words, schools measured my academic abilities using academic subjects, not art subjects. To suit the current educational system, many parents in my home country, Japan, send their children to cram schools to study academic subjects deeply.On the other hand, art subjects can strengthen the creativity and flexibility of individuals. Liberal arts, which include cultural understanding and knowledge, also include other arts subjects. In addition, we are living in the era of automation and artificial intelligence which are replacing human labor and office work more and more. In this regard, human creativity becomes more important. Therefore, art subjects are being more in demand to make a difference between individuals and computers.In conclusion, academic and arts subjects should blend in a school syllabus in a balanced way. Art subjects can also a better personality in individuals, so participation in these classes should be encouraged as well as academic achievements.The writer explored the reasons why including arts subjects in school syllabus is a good idea, while fluently expressing ideas and supporting them by examples. Correct paragraphing assists with orderly presentation of information, making this essay easy to follow; the range of vocabulary is quite wide. Accuracy of expression needs a bit more attention (see corrections underlined in blue), but overall, this essay could achieve IELTS Band 8.";Some individuals argue that art subjects, including music, drama, and creative writing, are crucial components of education, and that every school should incorporate them into their curriculum. I wholeheartedly agree with this assertion. In this essay, I will share my perspective and provide examples from my own experiences to illustrate the significance of including these subjects.Art subjects play a fundamental role in enriching our lives. Despite this, some parents prioritize a curriculum focused on more traditional academic subjects, such as mathematics, science, literature, and history. I believe that a balanced approach, integrating both academic and arts subjects, is essential, and I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of including arts in the school curriculum.On one hand, academic subjects are often critical for higher education. They are key requirements for entry into many universities and professional fields. Personally, I have never been required to take entrance exams that focused on art subjects when applying for high school or university. My academic abilities were evaluated solely based on traditional academic disciplines. Consequently, many parents in my home country of Japan opt to enroll their children in cram schools to ensure they excel in these conventional subjects.Conversely, art subjects cultivate creativity and adaptability in individuals. The liberal arts encompass cultural understanding and knowledge, which includes various forms of artistic expression. In our current age, dominated by automation and artificial intelligence increasingly replacing human labor, the value of human creativity cannot be overstated. As a result, there is a growing demand for art subjects to help distinguish individuals from machines.In conclusion, both academic and art subjects should coexist in school curricula in a harmonious manner. Participation in art classes can foster well-rounded personalities, making it just as important as academic success. This essay has explored the rationale behind incorporating arts into the school syllabus, demonstrating that both creativity and academics play vital roles in education. The logical structure and varied vocabulary enhance its readability, while some attention to accuracy could further elevate its quality. Overall, this essay exhibits the potential to achieve an IELTS Band 8.
779;Some people say that modern technology has made shopping today easier, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion;It is commonly argued that the fast pacing technology has helped people do shopping at the present time more easily. However, some people think online shopping is really difficult for them. This essay will consider both the advantages and disadvantages of the use of technology for shopping.One disadvantage of online shopping can be mentioned is that people cannot familiarize themselves with online applications for ordering essential goods and food. In fact, the elderly are not good at technology enough to go to virtual supermarkets. Besides, those who live in remote areas are not accessible easily to technology to buy online groceries.Despite its disadvantage, online shopping has brought about advantages for those who are technology natives. Firstly, it can be time-saving. In fact, shoppers can order any things they need with some clicks on the items, payment method, and time of delivery. Especially in a lingering Covid-19, when social distancing measures have been effective in some places in Viet Nam, according to a survey, the number of online shoppers has been increasing day by day, and thus many applications have been into existence, developed, and thrived.Another advantage of virtual shopping is that it can be life-saving to many people in a pandemic across nations. Going to supermarkets can be detrimental to buyers due to the spread of viruses and the higher risk of infection. For example, in order to buy bread for breakfast, people have to go out for it and thus may be exposed to infectious or incubated victims of Covid-19. Moreover, with preventive measures of Covid-19 containment, such as people not being allowed to go out for their essential goods, if they do not know how to make an online order, it is really difficult for them to survive during a pandemic.In conclusion, the use of technology for virtual shopping is beneficial to our time-saving and life-saving matters, though it is not familiar to some people. In my opinion, thanks to its advantages, I will continue to go shopping online, though the world has gone through the Covid-19 pandemic successfully.;It is often said that rapid advancements in technology have made shopping significantly easier for people today. However, some individuals find online shopping to be quite challenging. This essay will examine both the benefits and drawbacks of using technology for shopping.One drawback of online shopping is that some people struggle to navigate online platforms for purchasing essential goods and food. For instance, the elderly may find technology difficult to manage, making it hard for them to shop in virtual supermarkets. Additionally, those living in remote areas may not have access to the necessary technology to buy groceries online.On the other hand, online shopping offers several advantages, particularly for those who are tech-savvy. Firstly, it can save a considerable amount of time. Shoppers can order what they need with just a few clicks to select items, choose a payment method, and schedule delivery. Notably, during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, when social distancing measures were enforced in many parts of Vietnam, a survey indicated a steady increase in online shopping, leading to the emergence and growth of numerous applications.Another significant benefit of virtual shopping is that it can be life-saving during a pandemic. Visiting supermarkets poses a risk of virus transmission, increasing the likelihood of infection. For example, someone looking to buy bread for breakfast may need to venture outside, exposing themselves to potentially infected individuals. Moreover, during Covid-19 containment efforts that restricted people's ability to leave their homes for essential items, those unfamiliar with online ordering faced considerable difficulties in accessing necessary goods.In conclusion, utilizing technology for online shopping can positively impact our time management and health, despite some individuals not being comfortable with it.

727;Some people say that the experiences a child has before starting school have the most influence on their future life. Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. Discuss both views and give your own opinion?;There are a lot of research about development in human life, Some people say that the experiences a child has before starting school have the most influence on their future life. Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. In the following paragraph, I will discuss both view and give my opinion.On the one hands, There has a research that bad experience in children before begining at school, especcially in family, will become unforgettable deep heart. For example, Children who live with strict parents and has aggressive punishment when children doing littie wrong things. In the future, Children will tend to aggressive and feeling they has not received a love from family. This research surely reasonnable because family is an important factor of social life.On the other hands, There have an opinion even if children was velvet glove when raised with family. However, Especially in adolescent, Friend and teacher can infleuence as same as family because teenagers spend more time at school that with family as a reason learning in classroom more than primary school and have a more group work with friend. Thus, If teenager prefer to close with a good student (not smoking or drinking alcohol / invite classroom friends travel education museum in weekends or holiday), Parents can make sure that your child will mature to standard adults.In conclusion, In my opinion, Children would be infleuenced by family before begining at school. After that, They will has a lot of complex relationship in school from friends and teachers that can infleuences children. So, Children should try to control yourself in moral to be a best quality adults.;There is a wealth of research regarding human development, with some arguing that the experiences a child has before starting school significantly shape their future, while others believe that a teenager’s experiences, particularly in school, hold greater influence. In the following paragraph, I will explore both viewpoints and present my perspective.On one hand, studies indicate that negative experiences in early childhood, especially within the family, can leave lasting scars. For instance, children raised by overly strict parents who impose harsh punishments for minor mistakes may carry these painful memories into adulthood. Such children might develop aggressive tendencies and feel unloved by their families. This perspective is certainly reasonable, as family dynamics play a crucial role in shaping social development.On the other hand, some argue that regardless of how nurturing a home environment is, the influence of friends and teachers during adolescence can be equally impactful. Teenagers spend a significant amount of time at school, often engaging in collaborative activities and forming friendships. If a teenager surrounds themselves with positive peers—those who do not engage in harmful behaviors like smoking or drinking and who participate in enriching activities—parents can nurture their child into a responsible and well-rounded adult.In conclusion, I believe that early family experiences strongly influence a child before they start school. However, as they progress into their teenage years, the complex relationships they build with friends and teachers also play a critical role in their development. Therefore, children should strive to maintain strong moral character to become the best versions of themselves.
337;Some people think history has nothing or little to tell us, but others think that studying the past history can help us better understand the present. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;With the development of technology, an increasing number of people try to acquire the latest technology such as computer programming, rather than to study history. There is a debate whether studying histroy could give us more advantages to understand the present society. In my opinion, obtaining knowledge of past history would be definitely helpful for us to live well in society today. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.To begin with, looking back on history would give us the opportunity to notice mistakes which human beings used to make in the past. Specifically, all kinds of people and countries around the world had made innumerable mistakes throughout history. Besides, some of these mistakes might result in a huge number of victims. Therefore, human beings must avoid these tragedic events happening again. Above all, only knowing history could lead to avoidance of the recurrences. To be more specific, World War must be one of the serious events in human being history, and understanding of this truth have a significant impact on how we should live not to cause war again in the present society. It is manifest that leaning history is meaningful in this regard.On the other hand, some arguments can be made that old stories have little something to do with our present lives. However, closer examination would reveal that all the relationships present today originally come from something in the past. Knowing history enables us to find the best way to a fruitful future. The compelling example of this is racial discrimination in the U.S. Understanding the U.S. history could give us the best manner not to deteriorate relationships in the U.S. I suppose that studying history would be helpful for all human beings from this aspect.Having considered all the arguments above, learning history would be a major contributor to a better understanding of the present because we can know how to avoid the same mistake people used to made and how we should behave for the better result through history.;As technology continues to advance, more and more individuals are prioritizing skills such as computer programming over the study of history. This has sparked a debate about whether knowledge of history can enhance our understanding of contemporary society. In my view, learning about historical events is crucial for navigating today’s world effectively. I support this perspective for two primary reasons, which I will explore further in this essay.Firstly, examining history allows us to recognize past mistakes made by individuals and nations alike. Throughout history, countless errors have led to significant suffering and loss of life. It is essential for humanity to learn from these tragedies to prevent them from recurring. A prime example is World War I, a pivotal event that underscores the dire consequences of conflict. Gaining insight into such historical events can profoundly influence our behavior today, helping us foster a more peaceful society. This illustrates the importance of studying history.Conversely, some argue that historical narratives have little relevance to our modern lives. However, a deeper analysis reveals that our current relationships and societal structures are deeply rooted in the past. By understanding history, we can identify the best pathways toward a prosperous future. A relevant example is the issue of racial discrimination in the United States. By studying U.S. history, we can learn how to improve relationships and foster equality, demonstrating the value of historical knowledge in addressing contemporary issues.In conclusion, learning about history significantly enhances our understanding of the present, allowing us to avoid repeating past mistakes and guiding us toward more effective behavior. History serves as a vital tool for building a better society today.
411;Some people think students should study the science of food and how to prepare it. Others think that school time should be used in learning important subjects. Discuss both views and give your opinion?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;These days a portion of the society consider that students must learn the subject of cooking food and ways to make meals meanwhile, a group of people think that educational institutions shall be used to study more essential courses. I strongly agree that schools should be used for learning far important subjects rather than cooking classes. In this essay a im going to examin and discuss both phenomenon viewpoints and draw my personal opinion.In one hand, some people think that cooking and food subjects should be an important courses in schools,in addition, the steps of preparing meals and information about food may help students for a healthy lifestyle.On the other hand, a group of individuals consider that cooking is a hobby and cooking classes must be optional to the student and not requiered for all students, to illustrate even more, a bigger portion of students may not be interested in cooking as others,whereas, schools must be used for more serious purposes ,for example, studying more complicated courses will have a positive effect on the students academic outcomes ,meanwhile, adding courses such as cooking might effect the students time manegement and influence their ability to focus on the important things,for further explaination, if they have a test or different assignments deadlines they should be really focusing on that rather than attending cooking classes.In conclustion, and after analysis of both penomenon i presonally believe that cooking classes should not be considered as an essential course for students in educational institutions.;In today's society, there are differing opinions on whether students should learn cooking skills in school. Some believe that cooking is a crucial part of education, while others argue that academic institutions should prioritize more essential subjects. I firmly believe that schools should focus on teaching more critical subjects rather than cooking classes. In this essay, I will examine both viewpoints and present my own opinion.On one hand, advocates for cooking education argue that culinary skills are important for students. Learning how to prepare meals can contribute to healthier lifestyles and provide students with essential life skills.Conversely, many individuals view cooking as a hobby and believe that culinary classes should be optional rather than mandatory. Many students may not have an interest in cooking, and education should primarily focus on more serious academic subjects. Studying complex topics can positively impact students' academic performance. Additionally, incorporating cooking classes may disrupt students' time management and distract them from important assignments and exam preparations. For instance, if students are faced with deadlines for tests or projects, it would be more beneficial for them to concentrate on these priorities instead of attending cooking classes.In conclusion, after analyzing both perspectives, I personally believe that cooking classes should not be deemed essential in educational institutions.
59;Some people think that governments should ban dangerous sports, while others think people should have freedom to do any sports or activity. Discuss both views and give your own opinion;From the known history of the humanity, many sports or activities have been done to enjoy ourselfs, keeping in shape, or spent time. Grown up people should be free to do any kind of sports or activities by their will unless they are not hurting anyone else except theirselfs.Some people think when a citizen hurt his/herself, tax payers need to pay for the health care fees, and it should not be consern for the tax payers since they are paying only for fundamental situations. This point of view is not matching with the freedom. Yes, there might be a fee for tax payers, yet freedom should be above on all fees. While some people prefers less dangerous activities, others can be interested in more dangerous activities, as well.Governments can have some precautions to make citizens' life better. Yet, they should not involve such things like banning sports since it is the preference of the people which dealing with the dangerous sports. Some people could want to make more unique or exciting sports, and it is quite natural. Banning such kind of activities can be considered as limiting people's freedom.Since most of the people living together for a quite time in a society, people should pay respect on each others preferences, unless it is not interesting other people's personal area. As a calm and relax person, I am not intend to make dangerous sports or activities. However, I do not think that I have the right or power to say other people what should they do or not, and vice versa.;"Throughout human history, people have engaged in various sports and activities for enjoyment, fitness, and leisure. Adults should have the freedom to choose whatever sports or activities they desire, provided they are not harming anyone else but themselves. Some argue that when individuals injure themselves, taxpayers are burdened with their healthcare costs, suggesting that such matters should not concern the public since taxes should cover only essential services. However, this perspective is at odds with the principle of freedom. While there may be financial implications for taxpayers, individual freedom should take precedence over these costs. People have diverse preferences; some gravitate toward safer activities, while others are drawn to more adventurous pursuits.Governments can implement measures to enhance citizens' safety, but they should avoid overstepping by banning sports altogether, as this infringes on individual choices regarding riskier activities. Many individuals seek out unique and thrilling sports, and this desire is entirely natural. Prohibiting such activities could be seen as a restriction on personal freedom.In a society where people coexist for extended periods, it is vital to respect each other's preferences, as long as those choices do not infringe on personal boundaries. As someone who prefers a calm and relaxed lifestyle, I personally do not engage in dangerous sports. However, I believe it is neither my right nor my authority to dictate what others can or cannot do, and the same applies in reverse."
1325;Some people think that hosting an international sporting event is beneficial for a country, while others disagree. Do the advantages of hosting a major sporting event outweigh its disadvantages?;International sporting events are well-known for attracting a high level of attention because they give many people something to look forward to. Understandably, there are advantages and disadvantages for the host country, and careful consideration is required to determine whether a nation will benefit or lose from hosting a major sports championship.Worryingly, the new infrastructure required for hosting a major sporting event often comes at the expense of local people. Their lives get disrupted by construction works and at times residents have even been evicted from their homes for stadiums to be built. Worse still, practice shows the expensive, gigantic buildings constructed for the sports event aren’t being used afterwards and fall into disrepair, leaving the country with high maintenance bills. The financial burden from hosting the Olympic Games, for example, is staggering and can run into tens of billions. Still, the question remains whether or not the pros outnumber the cons.It is hard to underestimate the amount of influence on the country’s global status and prestige that comes with becoming a home to an international sporting event. New trade opportunities appear on the horizon, as it happened for many countries that hosted the Olympic Games. There is also a welcome increase in tourism, which gives the local economy a boost, injecting billions of dollars into the national budget. Construction of new stadiums, hotels and infrastructure such as new roads and rail links creates new jobs, further improving the country’s economy. Less tangible but still important is the aspect of national pride and the feel-good factor associated with hosting an international sports event.All in all, it seems to me that an international sporting event can bring more good than harm to a country, especially if its potential dangers can be avoided or minimised. Hosting a World Championship is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a country and an immense source of pride for its citizens.;International sporting events are renowned for drawing significant attention, as they provide a source of excitement for many. However, hosting such events has both pros and cons, and careful evaluation is necessary to ascertain whether a nation will truly gain or suffer from the experience. One troubling aspect is that the new infrastructure needed for these events often disrupts the lives of local residents. Construction projects can disturb communities, and in some cases, people have even been displaced from their homes to make way for stadiums. Furthermore, many of the large, expensive facilities built for these events frequently sit unused afterward, leading to deterioration and substantial maintenance costs. The financial implications of hosting the Olympic Games, for instance, can be overwhelming, often amounting to tens of billions. This raises the ongoing question: do the benefits outweigh the drawbacks?The impact on a country's global status and prestige from hosting an international sporting event is difficult to overstate. New trade opportunities often emerge, as seen in several nations that have previously hosted the Olympics. Additionally, tourism typically sees a surge, providing a significant boost to the local economy and injecting billions into the national budget. The construction of new stadiums, hotels, and infrastructure, including roads and rail links, creates jobs and further stimulates the economy. Beyond economic factors, there’s also an important element of national pride and the uplifting sentiment associated with hosting such global events.In conclusion, it appears to me that hosting an international sporting event can produce more benefits than drawbacks for a country, particularly if potential challenges are properly addressed or mitigated. For a nation, hosting a World Championship is a unique opportunity and a tremendous source of pride for its citizens.
575;Some people think that hosting international sports events may be beneficial for a country. Discuss both views.;Certain people believe that organizing international sports competitions could benefit host countries. While hosting sport events might also entail risks, I firmly believe that nations would gain much more than they would lose, as I will explain below.International sport competitions are usually large events that bring together thousands of people including athletes, staff, and tourists. This usually represents an attractive opportunity for local business and investors. People need to be fed, thus activating restaurants' economy. Additionally, they need a place to sleep and rest, which would benefit hotels. On the other hand, many countries hosting international competitions build new infrastructure, including stadiums, pools, public squares, and even airports. It is clear that several cities around the world have developed as a result of hosting such events. Let us take the example of the city Montreal in Canada, which hosted the olympic games a few decades ago. Organizing sports events also represents an opportunitty to improve the international image of a country. For example, it is not a secret that some countries such as Germany and Russia have used the World Cup to improve their international image, with positive results overall. Finally, since inhabitants of the host nation would feel inspired to practice a new sport, we could argue that competitions could additionally improve the health and wellbeing of citizens in the long term.It is important to mention, however, that hosting sport events might also entail some risks. These competitions are usually complex and expensive to organize, and middle- or low-income economies could better use their resources to build vital infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools. Moreover, examples around the world illustrate that some politicians see these events as an opportunity for curruption.In conclusion, there are more benefits than risks for countries when it comes to hosting international sport events. These events might translate into economic opportunities for local business and investors, could bring new infrastructure, and may trigger development.;Some individuals argue that hosting international sports competitions can be advantageous for the countries involved. While there are risks associated with organizing such events, I strongly believe that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks, as I will elaborate on below.International sports competitions are typically large-scale events that attract thousands of participants, including athletes, staff, and tourists. This influx creates a valuable opportunity for local businesses and investors. For instance, the demand for food boosts the restaurant industry, and the need for accommodations supports hotels. Additionally, many nations invest in new infrastructure when hosting these events, such as building stadiums, swimming pools, public spaces, and even airports. Numerous cities across the globe have thrived as a result of hosting such competitions. A prime example is Montreal, Canada, which transformed after hosting the Olympic Games several decades ago. Furthermore, organizing sports events can enhance a country's international reputation. Countries like Germany and Russia have effectively utilized the World Cup as a platform to improve their global image, yielding positive outcomes. Additionally, these competitions may inspire citizens in the host nation to engage in new sports, ultimately contributing to the long-term health and well-being of the population.However, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential risks of hosting sports events. The organization of these competitions can be complex and costly, and nations with limited financial resources might be better served by investing in essential infrastructure like hospitals and schools. Moreover, there are instances where politicians exploit these events for personal gain, leading to corruption.In summary, the benefits of hosting international sports events generally outweigh the associated risks. These events can stimulate economic opportunities for local businesses and investors, promote the development of new infrastructure, and encourage overall progress.
1017;Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Whilie some people believe that we can live with climate change instead of dealing with that, I don't agree with this idea because climate change can bring various disadvantages for our life.There are many disadvantages of climate change which can gradually push animals and also human to extinction. First and foremost, climate change promote the process of global warming which is one of the most dangerous result of climate change. Because of this situation, ice in 2 polar areas is melting day by day. As a result, the level of sea water will go up. Therefore, countries which are near by the sea may be drown in the future. Another drawback of climate change is that it causes many disaster. The figure for disaster is predicted to increase because of climate change. Hence, people and animals will have to deal with many dangerous disaster which can bring a lot of damage.Beside, I believe there are also many way to prevent climate change. Firstly, from my perspective, education is the best way to deal with the changing of climate. Because education raises the awareness of people about how dangerous climate change is, and it also teach people to protect the environment. Therefore, the effect of climate change will decrease. Secondly, local community should hold more volunteer activity for people to clean the palace where they live, so people can make sense of environmental protection and their neighborhood will also be cleaned. This activity can also contribute to prevent climate changeIn conclusion, I believe that people can't live with climate change and people have to prevent it.;While some individuals argue that we should learn to coexist with climate change rather than confront it, I disagree with this perspective due to the numerous negative impacts climate change can have on our lives.Climate change poses several threats that could ultimately lead to the extinction of both animals and humans. Primarily, it accelerates global warming, which is one of the most alarming consequences of climate change. As a result, ice in the polar regions is melting at an alarming rate, leading to rising sea levels. Consequently, coastal nations may face the risk of submersion in the future. Additionally, climate change contributes to an increase in natural disasters. Predictions indicate that the frequency and intensity of such disasters will grow, putting both human and animal lives at greater risk and causing significant damage.Moreover, I believe there are many effective strategies to combat climate change. Firstly, education is one of the most powerful tools at our disposal. It can raise awareness about the dangers of climate change and teach people how to protect the environment, ultimately mitigating its effects. Secondly, local communities should organize more volunteer initiatives aimed at cleaning the areas where they live. Such activities can enhance awareness of environmental protection while also improving the cleanliness of neighborhoods, contributing to climate change prevention efforts.In conclusion, I firmly believe that living with climate change is not a viable option, and that we must take proactive steps to combat it.
1341;Some people think that it is fine for professional athletes to misbehave on or off the field, as long as they are playing well (opinion);"Some people think that it is fine for professional sportsmen and sportswomen to misbehave on or off the field, as long as they are playing well.Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Sample EssayAlthough most professional athletes are aware of their position as role models for their fans and behave accordingly, there are sportsmen and sportswomen who behave poorly during matches and in their private life. While some people find it acceptable as long as their performance on the field is not impacted, not everyone agrees with that point of view.Those who put athletes’ performance on the field above everything else point out that competitive environment and immense pressure the sports people are under affect their behavior. They argue that athletes are entitled to privacy and their actions before and after games should not concern the general public. I find this hard to agree with, because poor behavior in sports people is incompatible with their role in public’s life and also for the reason that their actions could negatively affect their entire sports industry.The main reason why I believe athletes should behave well at all times is that their behavior is tremendously influential. Spectators respect players and many copy their actions and behavior; therefore, if top players misbehave or violate laws, some of the fans may feel compelled to follow their example and behave badly. For example, after an acclaimed baseball player was caught using drugs some years ago, the number of people who were arrested for the same crime significantly increased. This shows quite clearly why high profile players should consider their actions very carefully in order to promote a peaceful society.In addition, the behavior of athletes might affect the popularity of their sports. Some companies sponsor successful athletes who boost their brand recognition and sales of their products. Players and sports industry executives are financially compensated for endorsing products and participating in commercial advertisements. If they demonstrate poor behavior, sponsors could direct their money elsewhere, and as a result sports matches could suffer due to lack of funds. To illustrate, Sumo, a traditional Japanese sport, is held every season thanks to resources donated by companies. In a year when a Sumo player was involved in a violent crime, no matches were held, resulting in a large deficit of funds.In conclusion, I completely disagree with the opinion that top athletes are permitted to behave badly because their behavior may negatively influence the public behavior and sports industry itself.Assessor’s comment: This response addresses both sides of the argument by exploring the reasons why some people think athletes are allowed to behave poorly as long as they play well, and the reasons why others think poor behavior has no excuse. This response deserves a high score for task achievement because of that. A good range of cohesive devices is used in this essay; that and the organisation of ideas makes it easy to follow. Sentence structures are varied and the vocabulary is quite rich, the author also showed good control of grammar and spelling. It is worth noting that this sample is longer than the recommended 260 – 285 words, however, this isn’t an issue provided the author can complete an essay of this length and quality in under 40 minutes. Overall this is a good example of a Band 8 essay.";"Some individuals believe that it is acceptable for professional athletes to exhibit misconduct, whether on the field or in their private lives, as long as they maintain high performance levels. Do you agree or disagree with this perspective?Sample EssayWhile many professional athletes recognize their role as public figures and act accordingly, there are some who engage in inappropriate behavior both during competitions and in their personal lives. Although some people view this as acceptable provided their athletic performance remains unaffected, others strongly disagree.Proponents of the idea that athletes' on-field performance takes precedence highlight the intense pressures and competitive nature of the sports environment, suggesting that these factors can influence athletes' conduct. They assert that athletes deserve personal privacy and that their conduct outside of games should not be a concern for the public. I find it difficult to agree with this viewpoint, as unbecoming behavior among athletes contradicts their roles as public figures and can have detrimental effects on the sports industry as a whole.The primary reason I believe athletes should consistently uphold good behavior is due to their substantial influence on fans. Spectators hold players in high regard and often emulate their actions; therefore, if prominent athletes engage in misconduct or illegal activities, some fans may feel inclined to mimic this behavior. For instance, a few years back, when a well-known baseball player was discovered using drugs, there was a notable spike in arrests for similar offenses. This clearly illustrates the importance of high-profile athletes being mindful of their actions to foster a positive societal environment.Furthermore, athletes' behavior can impact the popularity of their respective sports. Many corporations sponsor successful athletes to enhance brand visibility and increase product sales. Athletes and executives in the sports industry often receive financial rewards for endorsing products and participating in advertisements. If they display unsatisfactory behavior, sponsors may reconsider their investments, leading to financial shortages that could hurt the sports themselves. For example, Sumo, a traditional Japanese sport, relies heavily on corporate sponsorships to conduct matches each season. Following an incident involving a Sumo wrestler and violent crime, all matches were suspended, resulting in a significant financial downturn.In conclusion, I firmly disagree with the notion that elite athletes should be allowed to behave poorly, as their actions can adversely affect public behavior and the sports industry itself. Assessor’s Comment: This response effectively covers both sides of the argument by analyzing the reasons some believe athletes should be exempt from accountability, while also emphasizing the counterargument that misconduct is unjustifiable. It merits a high score for task achievement due to its balanced exploration of the topic. The essay employs a good variety of cohesive"

Others feel that it is important to give one’s mind a rest in leisure time. Discuss.;As we are human we naturally need to rest leisure time to stress of work and everyday life. In fact, every individual need to do what they want and . Personally, I prefer to be active during this time because . Moreover, people are free what they do their leisure time, and nobody can say what is the best.Some people want to relax after their day of work. These people may prefer to relax by watching movies, reading or getting a massage. People who have a such as doctors, teachers and builders may choose these types of activities. If you are a doctor, you may feel that you want to let your body rest after work and you don’t want to do a five kilometer run after work, because you are already physically tired.On the other hand, some people choose to be active in their leisure time because they do . For example, these people many spend all day sitting on a chair and their work. At the end of a working day, they a backache, and all of their body tired so they need to stretch their arms and improve their health by doing some activity such as going to the gym or swimming.To sum up, the important thing is that people want to stay healthy by choosing what is best for them. In my view, the wrong way is to stay at home in your leisure time if you have a job.;"As humans, we naturally require rest and leisure to balance the stress of work and daily life. Everyone deserves the opportunity to engage in activities of their choice. Personally, I prefer to stay active during my leisure time because it energizes me. Moreover, individuals are free to spend their leisure time however they wish, and there's no single ""best"" way to do so.Some people prefer to unwind after a long day at work by engaging in relaxing activities like watching movies, reading, or getting massages. Professions such as doctors, teachers, and builders often lead individuals to seek these types of relaxation. For instance, a doctor may feel the need to rest physically after a demanding shift and may not want to undertake a strenuous activity like a five-kilometer run due to exhaustion.Conversely, others choose to be active during their leisure time because they may spend the majority of their day sitting. After a long workday, they might experience back pain and overall fatigue, making them eager to stretch their bodies and enhance their health through activities such as going to the gym or swimming.In summary, the key takeaway is that people should prioritize their health by selecting leisure activities that resonate with them. In my opinion, it is unwise to remain sedentary at home during your leisure time if you have a job."
1215;Some people think that it is important to use leisure time for activities that improve the mind, such as reading and doing word puzzles.Other people feel that it is important to rest the mind during leisure time.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.Write at least 250 words.;Leisure period from our everyday busy schedules is absolutely a well cherished time by most people. What should exactly be done during this free time has been the subject of debate for a while. Some would argue that engaging in simple and less brain tasking activities during this time keeps the mind busy,facilitates mental alertness and sanity.While other scholars would argue that keeping the mind relaxed would improve focus and recharge the mind for when needed at work after the free period has waned off.On the one hand, it seems beneficial to engage in activities that keeps the mind slightly engaged during our leisure period. This is basically due to the fact that some mind consciousness might be lost when idle.Sluggishness may thereforeset in when required to partake in activities that requires full attention. Hence playing chess and games might help maintain ones' awareness during a less busy period. Secondly, getting involved in basic activities like reading and surfing the internet during these free period could also help improve ones intellectual capacity and also overall general knowledge that could well be very beneficial to improving the entire state of the mind.On the other hand, those who say its essential to rest the mind after extensive period of activities might have a point.This is because resting the mind will help recharge Ones' batteries and general condition of the mind. Take for instance, a Tech inclined engineer that uses his mind and brain a lot to profer solutions to complex problems. A liitle period to be calm and relaxed will be of utmost importance to alleviate a potential mind and thoughts exhaustion.In conclusion, while it seems very important and beneficial to rest the mind during leisure period to aid rebooting of the mind and brain.I strongly believe that getting involved is some innovative and creative activities during these period improves our general state of health and mind.;Leisure time away from our hectic daily routines is a treasured experience for many. There has been ongoing discussion about how best to utilize this free time. Some argue that participating in simple, low-effort activities can help keep the mind engaged, promoting mental alertness and well-being. Conversely, others believe that truly relaxing the mind is essential for enhancing focus and recharging one’s mental resources for work after leisure has ended.On one hand, engaging in activities that require some mental involvement during leisure can be beneficial. This is because idleness may lead to a decline in mental sharpness, making it harder to concentrate when needed. For instance, playing chess or other strategic games can help maintain mental awareness during quieter periods. Additionally, spending free time on light activities such as reading or browsing the internet can enhance one’s knowledge and cognitive abilities, positively contributing to overall mental health.On the other hand, those who advocate for mindfulness and relaxation after intense work periods make valid points as well. Taking time to rest can help recharge the mind and boost overall mental health. For example, a technology-focused engineer who frequently tackles complex problems would likely benefit from moments of calm to alleviate potential cognitive fatigue.In conclusion, while it is crucial to allow the mind to rest during leisure periods to facilitate mental rejuvenation, I firmly believe that engaging in innovative and creative activities during this time can also greatly enhance our overall health and mental well-being.
865;Some people think that it is more beneficial to take part in sports which are played in teams, like football, while other people think that taking part in individual sports, like tennis or swimming, is better. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Sport play an essential role in shaping the personality of individual. Some people believe that sports which are played in teams are more beneficial like football, while others think that solo sports like tennis or swimming is better. The following essay will discuss both arguments and give my opinion that sports which are played in teams have more advantages over solo sport activites.First of all, there is no doubt that the individual sport activities enahnce people confidence. It helps building the personality and strentghen the mentality of the individuals. For examole, one role model in my home country was playing tennis table, he mentioned once in an interview, that sport helped him not only to win trophies but it raised his mental strength and shaped his pesonality.However, some people believe that, sports which are played in teamshave more advantages and all community will get the benefits. Soccer, for example, will help the players specifically the young children to understand working together and sharing the responsibility. In addition people will grow with better understanding to the concept of sharing achievements which can improve all the community. For instance, i was a member of soccer team in high school, me and my friends were taught, in order to win games we should put plans together and work as one unit. Furthermore, it helps me later in my career to understand the meaning of leadership and how the sharing responsibility and working together could bring the success to our endeavour.To conclude, solo sport can bring proud and honour to individuals butsports which played in teams teach people the meaning of working together which will improve the community in the future.;"Sports play a crucial role in shaping an individual's personality. While some argue that team sports like football offer greater benefits, others contend that individual sports such as tennis or swimming are superior. This essay will explore both perspectives, ultimately supporting the view that team sports provide more advantages than solo activities.Firstly, it's undeniable that individual sports can boost a person's confidence. They contribute to character development and strengthen mental resilience. For example, a prominent table tennis player from my home country once stated in an interview that his sport not only earned him accolades but also significantly enhanced his mental fortitude and shaped his personality.On the other hand, many believe that team sports have more advantages, benefiting the entire community. Take soccer, for instance; it teaches young players the importance of collaboration and shared responsibility. Through these experiences, individuals learn to appreciate the value of collective success, which can foster a sense of community. Drawing from my own experience as a member of a high school soccer team, my friends and I discovered that winning required us to devise plans and function as a cohesive unit. This experience later helped me understand leadership and the importance of collaboration in achieving success in my career.In conclusion, while individual sports can instill a sense of pride and honor in participants, team sports emphasize the significance of collaboration and build stronger communities for the future."
765;Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children’s development than playing computer games. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Some individuals believe that playing outside has a more positive effect on children's development rather than playing computer games. I share the idea that being involved in outdoor activities is more beneficial than playing computer games.Active development is the main reason for including outdoor activities in children's life. All people know that the development of children is an extremely significant part of building a personality. To do so parents should try to involve their children in exploring local insects, animals or playing different games such as football, riding bicycles, and many other. This will only expand the knowledge of children, and consequently have a positive effect on their development. This is also important to have a healthy generation in the future. Parents can join their children or they can find some friends around and also be socially active. For example, a father can teach his son how to bicycle or how to take care of plants and trees.The next important reason for doing more outdoor activities for children is avoiding physical problems, which can cause computer games. Currently, a lot of people including children suffer from different side effects of a lazy lifestyle and obesity can exemplify it. To avoid problems with physical health in the future, spending a couple of hours should be recommended to all children.Of course, little time spent playing computer games will not hurt children, but it is important to limit it. To sum up, children should do more outdoor activities and play computer games less.;Many people believe that outdoor play positively influences children's development more than playing video games. I concur that participating in outdoor activities is more advantageous than engaging in computer games. Active development is the primary reason for promoting outdoor activities in children's lives. It is widely recognized that childhood development is a crucial aspect of shaping one’s personality. Therefore, parents should encourage their children to explore their surroundings, such as observing local insects and animals or engaging in activities like soccer and biking. These experiences broaden children's knowledge and positively impact their growth, contributing to a healthier generation in the future. Parents can participate alongside their children or help them connect with peers to foster social interactions. For instance, a father can teach his son how to ride a bike or nurture plants and trees.Another significant reason for encouraging outdoor activities is to prevent the physical issues associated with excessive computer gaming. Today, many individuals, including children, experience negative effects from sedentary lifestyles, with obesity being a prime example. To mitigate future health problems, it is recommended that children spend a few hours engaging in physical activities.While limited time spent on computer games is unlikely to harm children, it is essential to establish boundaries. In conclusion, children should prioritize outdoor activities and minimize their time spent playing video games.
613;Some people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;It is often argued out there about sports, debating about both physcial and mental strengths and which is far more crucial to the success. This essay will go over these two points of view in further depth and outline some expamples, where relevant, for each.On one side, some people think that the most important factor to succeeding in sports is the physical strength. Body strength is actually quite indispensable in any sport activity, especially those types of sports that demand a high fitness level and high physical endurance, etc, such as MMA fights, wrestling, football, and so on. All of these require an elevated and advanced charachterestics of one's body. For example, an athlete can not keep up a football match and running around for 90 minutes without a high body endurance, fitness, so on and so forth.On the other hand, the others believe that a powerful mentality and mindset are needed for such success and accomplishment. That is, they believe that one's attitude is the first key to success before anything else. People need to have some sort of a mindset with specific qualities, such as perseverance, determination, concentration, etc. and it's not always about havign a massive body strength. For example, some MMA athletes step in the ring with solid bodies, will not always win the games if they're not determined and persistent already, altought their opponents do not have that huge bodies. It's all about the mindset.In conclusion, it's not easy to decide which of these two criteria is more important than the other. However, I believe that any athlete must have these two, train them both before getting into any challenge, no matter what type of activity. An athlete must have a strong body and a trained attitude once and for all.;There's ongoing debate regarding the relative importance of physical and mental strength in sports and their contributions to success. This essay will explore both perspectives in greater detail, providing relevant examples for each.On one hand, many argue that physical strength is the key to success in sports. Indeed, physical fitness is essential in activities that require high levels of endurance and stamina, such as mixed martial arts, wrestling, and football. These sports demand advanced physical attributes, without which athletes struggle to perform at their best. For instance, a football player cannot sustain their performance for a full 90-minute match without significant endurance and fitness.Conversely, others contend that a strong mental attitude is crucial for achieving success. They believe that mindset is a fundamental component of an athlete’s success, often taking precedence over physical attributes. Qualities such as perseverance, determination, and focus are vital, even in the absence of overwhelming physical strength. For example, in mixed martial arts, an athlete may possess an impressive physical build but may still lose if they lack the determination and mental toughness that their less muscular opponent possesses. Ultimately, success hinges on mindset.In conclusion, determining which of these two aspects—physical strength or mental resilience—is more important is a complex issue. However, I believe that athletes must cultivate both attributes in order to thrive in any competitive environment. A strong body and a well-trained mindset are essential for any athlete aiming to succeed.
1349;Some people think that public health in a country can be improved by government making laws regarding nutritious food (agree/disagree).;Some people think that public health within a country can be improved by government making laws regarding nutritious food. Others, however, think that health is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Personal and public health are tightly related to food choices. While some people believe that the government should regulate nutrition to improve public wellness, others argue that it should be people’s decision whether to pursue a healthy diet or not. This essay will discuss both points of view and explain why the authorities should not control the types of food people can buy.Legislators could impose laws concerning nutritious food in an effort to have a healthier population, public health costs. Even if this could be considered a good idea, it would be very quite difficult to implement. To achieve this target, the rulers could impose a levy on unhealthy food options, or reduce their availability on the grocery stores shelves. In Italy, for example, products such as carbonated sugary drinks and chips are heavily taxed. As a result, the sales of these items have decreased. However, if the authorities start to take control of what their citizens can or cannot eat, it may be seen as limitation of freedom.Since personal freedom is an extremely important human right, many people think that they should be responsible for their choices regarding the food and drinks they decide to consume. I agree with this opinion because limiting nutritional options, even if it is done with the best outcome in mind, could consequently create dissatisfaction among the population, which would possibly lead to other public issues such as protests and demonstrations. A better approach could be educating the public about a healthy diet, which would help people make better-informed decisions about the food they consume. Many developed countries around the world employed this strategy and saw public health gains.In conclusion, even though the government is able to control the dietary habits of its population through taxation and restrictions, healthier citizens and reduced public health expenses isn’t the only possible outcome. Limiting personal freedom could result in social unrest and for that reason diet decisions are better to be left up to well-informed individuals.This response achieved the task requirements by discussing whether the government or individuals should be in control of their diet. The ideas are developed and supported by examples, the information is organised in paragraphs, and coherence is maintained throughout the essay. A range of sentences structures and advanced vocabulary is used in this work. Overall, it seems worthy of IELTS Band 8+.;"Some individuals believe that the government can enhance public health by enacting laws related to nutritious food. Conversely, others contend that health should be regarded as a personal choice and responsibility. This essay will explore both perspectives and argue against government control over food options.Food choices are intricately linked to both personal and public health. While some advocate for government regulations on nutrition to foster public well-being, others argue that diet should be a matter of individual choice. Legislators might propose laws aimed at creating a healthier population by imposing taxes on unhealthy food items or limiting their availability in stores. For instance, in Italy, there are high taxes on sugary drinks and snacks, which have contributed to a decline in their sales. However, such governmental control could be perceived as an infringement on personal freedom.Personal freedom is a fundamental human right, which leads many to feel that individuals should be accountable for their dietary choices. I share this viewpoint, as imposing restrictions on food options—regardless of the intended positive outcomes—might generate dissatisfaction among the populace, potentially resulting in social unrest, such as protests. A more effective strategy would be to educate the public about healthy eating, empowering people to make informed choices about their diets. Many developed countries that have implemented such educational initiatives have seen improvements in public health.In conclusion, while the government has the capacity to influence dietary habits through taxation and restrictions, achieving healthier citizens and reduced public health costs is not the sole likely outcome. Curbing personal freedoms could lead to societal discord; thus, it is preferable to leave dietary decisions in the hands of well-informed individuals. This analysis meets the task requirements by examining whether government or individuals should govern dietary choices. Ideas are thoroughly developed and supported with examples, organized coherently in paragraphs, and demonstrate a variety of sentence structures and advanced vocabulary, warranting a potential IELTS Band 8+ rating."
1386;Some people think that students who don’t take a break in studies between the high school and the university are at disadvantage compared to students who travel and work after high school before further continuing their education. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, in our competitive world, to succeed, knowledge from school and university is not enough. Therefore, students who study from the school to university get fewer benefits and contribute less too, compared to those who travel or work and get experience and skills . There are two following reasons to support for my opinion. I refer to the group of people who study from school to university as ‘group A’ and the other group – as ‘group B’.Firstly, at school and university, what group A gains is almost entirely theory, theory and theory. Of course, theory is very , however, you can’t do everything with just theory. You must have experience. This is what group A . Although in the third or fourth year at university, group A can be apprentices in some companies, to help them approach their future jobs, they aren’t trained well because of the short time spent working. And the real job is still very strange to them. After graduating, without experience, group A students can’t accomplish their work perfectly. On the other hand, it takes them time and money to keep up with other experienced students and they may be scorned. Therefore, group A students can contribute less than group B who have the two most important things: skills and experience.Secondly, as group A students are contributing less, they surely get less benefit. Moreover, many companies which employ people in group A have to train them from ground-up. These companies take this cost from group A’s salary to reduce the risk of their employees leaving to other companies after being trained. So, less benefits are unavoidable and certain, group B members are more loyal and effective workers. They also have useful experience and skills. Besides, their education is the same as or even higher than that of group A. As the result, group B gets more benefits absolutely.In conclusion, I think a student should travel or work before going to the university. That way, not only will they have basic knowledge but also skills and experience which are useful for them to get a good job and have a brilliant future.;"In today's competitive landscape, having only a formal education from school and university is insufficient for achieving success. Consequently, students who pursue education from school through university often gain fewer advantages and contribute less compared to those who travel or work to acquire real-world experience and skills. I refer to students who focus solely on their studies as 'group A,' whereas those who seek practical experience will be labeled 'group B.' Firstly, students in group A primarily acquire theoretical knowledge during their time in school and university. While understanding theory is important, it is not enough on its own; practical experience is crucial. Although group A may partake in internships during their later university years to prepare for their future careers, these short stints often do not provide adequate training, leaving them ill-prepared for the realities of the workplace upon graduation. Lacking hands-on experience, graduates from group A may struggle to perform their jobs effectively and will require additional time and resources to catch up to their more experienced peers, resulting in potential feelings of inadequacy.Secondly, due to their limited contributions to the workplace, group A students tend to receive fewer advantages. Many employers who hire these students often find themselves needing to train them from scratch, a cost that is reflected in reduced salaries. In contrast, group B members bring valuable skills and experiences to their roles, making them more effective and dependable employees. Moreover, their educational qualifications are often comparable to or even exceed those of group A. As a result, group B not only secures greater benefits but also contributes more significantly to their organizations.In conclusion, I believe that students should consider traveling or working before entering university. This approach allows them to gain essential skills and experiences alongside their academic knowledge, ultimately equipping them for better job prospects and a brighter future."
1281;Some people think that the most important thing about being rich is it gives a person the opportunity to help other people.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Helping other people in society is noble goal ,to some people it's a big achievement .However rebuilding personality of individuals and giving them an opportunity to leave an influence in the community is reflecting the genuien humanity .Therefore i agree with notion that rich people who are, in fact have the ability to offer the help for orthers in order to recreate healthy environment for everbody to work in our society .The following essay will illuminate the reason behind my opinion .Regrettably . many people suffer form disadvantages situtaions nowdays like losing jobs or money ,they find themselves have no energy or motive to contiune and to help their families . As a result of that poverty propagates in some society and usually accompany with low level availability of education . Hence to avoid falling into misery, some countries nowdays help non governmenrtal organizations and institutions to give assist to poor communities in a manner to raise education and develop health sector. For instance , Red Cross and Save the children , both organizations offere help and leverage human rebuild personality which no doubt will enrich these communities with several benefits .In spite of green vevet picture that mentioned above , some people think that helping people alone is not enough . However , others believe that no matter how grim or daunting things may seem , if the individual have the courage to move a head , then everything is possible . Nevertheless people can find the motive inside eventhoughlife handed them a toughest time . For example Helen Keller .An American Author , although she born with disability but she could be one of greatest authors in western history .In summary , no doubt that people should have the courage to move a head whether they find help from others or not . However people who can offer the help will make our community live peacefully and bring prosperity to our offsprings .;"Helping others in society is a noble goal; for some, it represents a significant achievement. However, truly transforming the personalities of individuals and enabling them to make a positive impact on their community reflects our fundamental humanity. Therefore, I support the idea that wealthy individuals have the means to assist others, fostering a healthy environment where everyone can thrive. This essay will explore the reasons behind my perspective.Unfortunately, many people today face difficult circumstances, such as job loss or financial hardship, which can leave them feeling drained and lacking motivation to support their families. Consequently, poverty is perpetuated in some communities, often accompanied by limited access to education. To combat this cycle of despair, many countries now support non-governmental organizations and institutions that assist underserved communities by enhancing educational opportunities and improving healthcare. For instance, organizations like the Red Cross and Save the Children offer support and empower individuals to rebuild their lives, ultimately enriching their communities with numerous benefits.Despite the positive impact mentioned above, some may argue that assistance alone is insufficient. Others contend that even in the face of overwhelming challenges, an individual's determination can make anything possible. People can discover motivation from within, even during the toughest times. A prime example is Helen Keller, an American author who, despite being born with disabilities, became one of the most celebrated writers in Western history.In conclusion, it is essential for individuals to have the courage to persevere, whether or not they receive help from others. Nevertheless, those who can provide support will contribute to a more peaceful community and ensure a prosperous future for our children."
1081;Some people think that there should be strict laws to control the amount of noise a person makes because of the disturbance it causes to people.Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;With the increasing population in cities,noise pollution has been one of the important causes of concern.This essay presents the advantages and disadvantages of the strict laws that are made to control noise pollution.Noise pollution affects different groups of people in various ways.The increasing noise in recent days has led to increasing problems of hearing impairment in people in today's society.Also,the noise pollution has a devastating affects on the heart patients and it has been affecting people who are working and studying in various ways.By implementing strict rules like imposing heavy fines on vehicles honking unnecessarily and filing a case on the noise caused by the public gatherings like rallies,the above problems can be addressed.For example, recent studies have shown that the cities having less noise pollution have been leading better life when compared to those with noise pollution.However,implementing strict laws on noise caused by a person also has some disadvantages.Firstly,different religions have different kinds of festivals which cause a lot of noise.For instance,diwali,one of the most celebrated festivals in India,is celebrated by firing crackers causing a lot of noise is affected by implementing these laws.Secondly,most of the people with religious beliefs will have a bad impact by these rules.To give an example,the prayers in masjids are made with loud noise so that it can reach a large group of people living in the area.To conclude,implemeting strict rules like fines and filing a case on the people causing noise pollution have a good impact on the health of the society and increasing the efficiency of work where as the festivals and the religious centres have a negative impact by these laws.;As urban populations continue to grow, noise pollution has emerged as a significant concern. This essay explores the pros and cons of stringent regulations designed to mitigate noise pollution.Noise pollution impacts various demographics in different ways. The rise in ambient noise levels has been linked to an increase in hearing impairments within the community. Furthermore, noise pollution has severe repercussions for individuals with heart conditions and adversely affects those engaged in work and study. Implementing strict measures, such as hefty fines for excessive vehicle honking and legal actions against noisy public events like rallies, can help alleviate these issues. Recent studies indicate that cities with lower noise levels contribute to a higher quality of life compared to those burdened by significant noise pollution.On the other hand, enforcing strict noise regulations can also lead to certain drawbacks. Different cultures and religions celebrate various festivals that inherently generate significant noise. For instance, Diwali, one of India's most cherished festivals, involves the use of fireworks, which would be negatively impacted by such regulations. Additionally, individuals with strong religious beliefs might perceive these laws as restrictive. For example, loud prayers in mosques serve to ensure that they can be heard by larger groups within the community.In conclusion, while implementing strict measures such as fines and legal action against those who contribute to noise pollution can positively influence public health and productivity, these regulations can also negatively affect cultural and religious practices.
1431;Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than with a teacher. Others think that it is always better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.;It is certainly said that learning is an ongoing process .Every person something new their age, experience, knowledge and education. According to my point of view it is always better to have teacher or guide for study.One teacher has adequate knowledge to teach their student. knows ways to make subject easier for the students, moreover, he teaches them in an effective manner. For example, some students are weak in some subjects but a teacher them according to their mental capacity. . Some people can learn better in the topics with others. In class people can the views of others, . .In the today’s competitive world, everybody is busy, some people think that their time classes they can learn better their subject . They can attend online classes by using the Internet at home. They can get relevant information from the Internet regarding their topic. There is specific time or age limit to learn something new. Some new things we can only learn from experience – for example new facts, new habits and so on., I would like to say that it is always better for the people to have a teacher because a teacher has good knowledge, experience and is educated how to teach others. People will learn from a teacher in an easier way rather than on their own.;"It is often said that learning is a continuous journey. Each individual gains new insights throughout their life, shaped by their age, experiences, knowledge, and education. In my opinion, having a teacher or guide is always advantageous for the learning process. A skilled teacher possesses the knowledge necessary to effectively instruct their students and knows how to simplify complex subjects. Additionally, they teach in a way that resonates with their students' learning styles. For instance, some students may struggle with certain subjects, but a good teacher adapts their methods based on the student's mental capacity. Furthermore, some people learn better when collaborating with others; in a classroom setting, they can exchange ideas and perspectives. In today's competitive environment, many people are preoccupied with their schedules, leading to the belief that they can learn more effectively through classes. Online courses now provide the opportunity to study from home, allowing easy access to relevant information and resources on any topic. It's important to note that there is no specific age or time limit for learning something new; many insights can only be gained through experience, such as acquiring new facts or habits.In conclusion, I believe that having a teacher is invaluable, as they bring knowledge, experience, and effective teaching strategies that make learning much easier compared to self-study."
693;Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Space, so unknown for the humankind that it generates so much curiosity among experts and enterprenues. Due to this curiosity, the amount of resources and money invested in its exploration is surprisingly big. Developing technology for it is expensive but, in my humble opinion, completly justified.Firstly, developing technology is vital so that space exploration can be carried out succesfully. Experts have discovered that we only know a 4 percent of the entire universe. If with only that 4 percent we have accomplished amazing achievements, imagine what the human race could do when knowing a 10 percent.Secondly, space exploration and the technology involve on it not only will help the human race understand the universe but also will provide a whole new kind of tourism, space tourism. The CEOs of some of the most profitable business in America are investigating this possibility. The leading enterprises in this sector are Blue Origin from Jeff Bezos and Space X from Elon Musk. When discovered the way of sending people to space safely, space tourism will generate twice the money spent on technology for space exploration.In a nutshell, space exploration is crutial for the development of the human race. Furthermore, if this was not enough, all the technology developed will serve the purpose of creating a whole new kind of tourism that will generate billions of dollars in revenue. From my point of view, even though here on earth there are several problems to be solve with money, our future lies on space, so be must spend as much money as possible.;Space remains largely uncharted territory for humanity, sparking immense curiosity among experts and entrepreneurs alike. This fascination has led to substantial investments of resources and funds in its exploration. While developing technology for space travel can be costly, I firmly believe that the expense is entirely justified.Firstly, advancing technology is essential for successful space exploration. Researchers have found that we understand only about 4 percent of the universe. Given the remarkable achievements we've made with such limited knowledge, imagine the possibilities if we were to expand our understanding to just 10 percent.Secondly, space exploration and the associated technology will not only enhance our comprehension of the universe, but also pave the way for an entirely new industry: space tourism. Chief executives from some of America's most profitable companies are actively exploring this potential. Leading players in this field include Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Elon Musk's SpaceX. Once a reliable method for safely sending people to space is established, space tourism could generate twice the amount invested in the technology for exploration.In summary, space exploration is crucial for the advancement of humanity. Additionally, the technology we develop will create a new form of tourism that could yield billions in revenue. While there are pressing issues on Earth that require funding, I believe our future lies in the cosmos, and we should allocate as many resources as possible to this endeavor.
1309;Some people today believe that it is acceptable to use physical force to discipline children, but others feel it is completely unacceptable.Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Punishing children with physical force, or corporal punishment as it is also called, is something that was accepted not so long ago and people over the age of forty may well remember it. Nowadays, however, corporal punishment is against the law in most countries and adults who practise it can be taken to court. Children are always a vulnerable group and they depend on adults for protection and education. Of course, part of the growing up process is testing and breaking boundaries and it is nearly always necessary to instill discipline on a child. Whether or not it is necessary to use physical force to do so can be a very emotive subject.Supporters of corporal punishment often defend their standpoint by explaining that the corporal punishment is not, or should not be, excessive. They do not argue that a child should be beaten severely until he or she is bruised or cut. They argue that just the infliction of mild pain causes effective discipline and also the fear that it might be applied. People who grew up experiencing it might offer this point of view.Those who oppose using physical force on a child would say that the vulnerability and innocence of a child means that force should never be used. Children need to trust adults and believe that no harm will come to them. Additionally, children learn from adults and it is argued that corporal punishment will only teach children that force is an answer to various problems. It is also claimed that corporal punishment has no added benefits over other forms of discipline that do not require physical force. Using it can cause psychological harm to children and should be classed as child abuse.Personally, I do not believe that limited use of forms of corporal punishment can cause harm, and a parent who administers a mild form of it to his or her child should not be subject to criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, I would not use it myself. I can also recognise the possibilities of adults who are not a child’s parents misusing corporal punishment. Therefore, I believe that on balance physical force to discipline children should not be permitted.;"Punishing children through physical means, commonly known as corporal punishment, was widely accepted until relatively recently, particularly among those over forty who may remember its prevalence. Today, however, such practices are illegal in most countries, and adults who engage in them can face legal consequences. Children are inherently vulnerable and rely on adults for safety and education. While part of growing up involves testing limits, it's often necessary to establish discipline. The question of whether physical force is needed in this process can be highly contentious.Proponents of corporal punishment may argue that it should not involve excessive force. They often clarify that they do not advocate for severe beating or causing visible injury; instead, they believe that mild pain can effectively instill discipline and create a fear of future punishment. Individuals who were raised in environments where this method was commonplace might support this viewpoint.On the other hand, opponents of corporal punishment argue that a child's vulnerability and innocence mean that physical force should never be an option. They emphasize the importance of trust between children and adults, asserting that children should feel safe from harm. Additionally, it's argued that using physical punishment teaches children that violence is a solution to problems. Critics claim that corporal punishment offers no additional advantages compared to non-violent disciplinary methods and can lead to psychological harm, warranting its classification as child abuse.Personally, I believe that limited, non-harmful forms of corporal punishment may not cause significant damage, and parents who apply gentle forms of discipline should not face criminal charges. However, I would choose not to employ such methods myself. I also recognize the potential for non-parental adults to misuse corporal punishment. Therefore, I conclude that, overall, the use of physical force for disciplining children should not be allowed."
1358;Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems, is this a positive or negative development?;Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems. Is it a positive or negative development? Give your own opinion and examples from your experience.At present, the Internet plays a vital role in almost every aspect of human life. As a result, individuals are searching online reasonable solutions to their illnesses. Not everyone is convinced that access to such information online is safe and helpful. However, in my view, providing the general public with access to trustworthy information about medical disorders would invariably improve the quality of the medical care for the whole society.Nowadays, even though there are plenty of online platforms developed for medical education, most of the sites have not been written by professional healthcare providers. Hence, there is a high possibility of spreading wrong medical information throughout the world, unless the site developers are held accountable for the content they provide. If patients receive incorrect information about a medical procedure and follow the wrong advice, for instance, to remove a wart at home, it might lead to a serious infection, excessive bleeding or another medical emergency. That would constitute a negative effect of using online knowledge for medical treatments at home rather than visiting a professional.On the flip side, the Internet, the society is well aware of most common medical disorders and preventive measures. Consequently, a reasonable and prudent individual can decide whether to get professional opinion on one’s disease or to handle it at home, that they get reliable online medical information. Moreover, if patients can manage mild medical problems themselves, it would certainly reduce the workload at the local hospitals, freeing more doctors for patients in real need. Besides, if patients come with a certain extent of knowledge about their condition to the medical consultation, it would invariably be helpful to the medical practitioner for effective decision making.To sum up, it is evident that online search for information on medical disorders can be a positive development as long as the general public receives trustworthy information.This response addresses the topic well. The writer’s position is clearly explained and supported, the information is organised in paragraphs in an easy to follow way, and use of linking words is appropriate. A range of complex sentence forms is used and there are very few errors in word choice or word formation (underlined in blue). Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.;Many individuals turn to the Internet to seek solutions for their medical issues. Is this trend beneficial or detrimental? In my opinion, while there are risks, the availability of reliable online medical information can significantly enhance healthcare for society as a whole.Today, the Internet is integral to nearly every facet of life, with many people relying on it to find answers to their health concerns. Despite this trend, there are valid concerns about the safety and accuracy of the information available. However, I believe that empowering the public with access to credible medical information can lead to better overall healthcare outcomes.While there are numerous online platforms dedicated to medical education, many of these resources are not authored by healthcare professionals. This raises the risk of disseminating misleading medical information. For instance, if individuals misinterpret advice they find online and attempt dangerous self-treatment for something like wart removal, it could result in severe complications such as infections or excessive bleeding. Such scenarios highlight the potential dangers of relying on dubious online sources instead of seeking professional medical advice.On the positive side, the Internet has heightened public awareness of common health issues and preventive strategies. An informed individual can make wiser decisions about seeking professional medical help or addressing minor ailments at home, provided they access trustworthy resources. Furthermore, if patients can competently manage minor health issues independently, it could alleviate pressure on local healthcare facilities, allowing medical professionals to focus on more serious cases. Additionally, when patients arrive at consultations equipped with knowledge about their conditions, it can facilitate more effective communication and decision-making with their doctors.In conclusion, while there are risks associated with online health research, it can also be a positive trend if the information accessed is reliable. Ensuring that the public has the tools to find trustworthy medical information will ultimately lead to improved health outcomes for everyone.
949;Some say that because many people are living much longer, the age at which people retire from work should be raised considerably.To what extent do you agree or disagree?;People nowadays are living much longer.With the discovering of new medicine and with the innovation in the medical field, the life expectancy of a person skyrocketed over the last decade.Some people might think that the consequence of this phenomenon should be the fact that the age at which people retire from work ought to be raised considerably.I don't agree with this idea.Rather than involving the life expectancy of a person, we should consider the job itself.Is it tiring? Does it require a person to be able to react immediately to a potential problem?If the job is tiring I think that it would be better for a person to retire. If you end up being worn out every day because your job is very exhausting the life expectancy should not be the fact that decides if you have or not the right to retire.The question ought to be: Is the person physically and mentally able to cope with the work?The older you get the slower you become. This is another pivotal factor that should be taken into account when deciding the retirement age of a person.The ability to react to dangerous events keeps the working environment under control.Let's imagine a carpenter working on the construction of a new building.What if a wall suddenly falls? Does an elderly person react faster than a younger worker?I am an optimistic person but I would stick to my guns in this scenario betting on the younger person.I would like to wrap up this essay by saying that I could have thought of many more reasons that explain why the age at which people retire from work should not be based entirely on the fact that people are living longer.Of course, this can not be ignored but basing this decision only on this fact it is seen by me as a poor approach.;People today are living significantly longer due to advancements in medicine and innovations in the healthcare sector, resulting in a dramatic increase in life expectancy over the past decade. Some may argue that this trend necessitates raising the retirement age substantially. However, I disagree with this perspective.Instead of focusing solely on life expectancy, we should take the nature of the job into account. Is the work physically demanding? Does it require quick reactions to unforeseen situations? If a job is particularly exhausting, I believe it would be more appropriate for an individual to retire, regardless of their increased longevity. If someone is consistently worn out from their job, their life expectancy should not determine their eligibility for retirement.The critical question should be whether a person is physically and mentally equipped to handle their work responsibilities. As we age, our reaction times can slow down, which is another essential factor to consider when deciding on retirement age. The ability to respond effectively in potentially dangerous situations is crucial for maintaining a safe working environment.For instance, think about a carpenter involved in constructing a new building. If a wall were to unexpectedly collapse, would an older worker be able to react as swiftly as a younger one? While I am generally optimistic, I would confidently place my bet on the younger worker in such a scenario.In conclusion, I could identify numerous reasons why the decision on retirement age should not be solely influenced by the fact that people are living longer. Although we cannot ignore this factor, I believe that relying exclusively on life expectancy is a misguided approach.

655;Some systems require students to specialize in a limited range of subjects from the age of fifteen. Other systems require students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?;"Education programs are different from one area to another area, there are systems that learners are required to choose restricted number of courses for their academic curriculum by the age of 15.while,other educational systems ask students to take comprehensive courses until they graduate from school. There are many positives for both trends, in my opinion limited range of academic subjects education system is better.On the one hand, it is basic knowledge to accept the idea that pupils who study selected number of subjects from age of fifteen are more informative academically in specified field of study. For example, when student decide to take medical subjects from early age the student will be prepared by tutors completely for the nominated curriculum,as a result all the student's focus will be on medical topics thus, the student is more qualified to practice medicine more efficiently after school graduation.Furthermore, this system will build a solid knowledge background in limited range of subjects can help to develop creativity at early age.Moreover, in the financial view point it may be better for students to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15; selected number of academic subjects means less money allocated for educational services by guardians.On the other hand, it is true to claim that general subjects system can prepare students to be more informative in various different live aspects. Since, students who register with wide range subjects system can gain academic knowledge and support in fields such as mathematics,physics,medicine,and....ect. Therefore,those students can select more than one speciality to practice as a professionalism in future.Besides, wide range system help to improve social interactions better,because friends will not be separated and they continue school education together until graduation,inaddition there is chance to make more friends as primises are more crowded.To sum up, educational systems main target is to develop and progress academic background of students.But, in my opinion,it is better to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15 due to reasons like: solid academic background in specific field,creativity,and less financial burden on parents.";Education programs vary significantly from one region to another. Some systems require students to select a limited number of courses for their academic curriculum by the age of 15, while others mandate that students take a broad range of courses until graduation. Both approaches have their advantages, but I believe that an education system with a restricted selection of subjects is superior.On one hand, it is widely acknowledged that students who study a limited number of subjects from the age of 15 acquire deeper knowledge in their chosen field. For instance, a student who opts to focus on medical subjects early on will receive tailored instruction from educators skilled in that curriculum. This focused approach allows the student to concentrate solely on medical topics, leading to greater proficiency upon graduation. Furthermore, building a solid foundation in a narrower range of subjects can foster creativity at an early age. From a financial perspective, this system may also be advantageous, as a limited selection of subjects can reduce educational costs for families.On the other hand, it can be argued that a more general education system prepares students to be well-rounded individuals with knowledge across various disciplines. Students enrolled in a wide range of subjects can benefit from learning in areas such as mathematics, physics, and medicine. This versatility allows them to pursue multiple specialties professionally in the future. Additionally, a broad curriculum enhances social interactions, as students remain together throughout their education, fostering friendships and camaraderie in busier classrooms.In conclusion, while the primary goal of educational systems is to develop students’ academic knowledge, I contend that enrolling in a limited range of subjects from the age of 15 is preferable. The advantages include a solid academic foundation in a specific field, increased creativity, and reduced financial pressure on parents.
1347;Some think that children should leave their family home as soon as possible while others believe they should stay for as long as they like (discuss);Some people think that it is best to encourage children to leave their family home as soon as possible. Others believe children should stay at the family home for as long as they like. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayAlthough it is thought by some that urging young people to abandon their family home at an early age is beneficial for them, others believe that it is better if children stay with their families for longer. In my opinion, leaving family home early has many advantages for children.On the one people think that youngsters ought to leave their parents’ house so as to learn life skills at an early age. Their reasoning is that it should push young people towards independence and make them learn from life lessons rather than merely rely on their parents. For example, students who pursue tertiary study away from their home city might learn taking personal responsibility. Also, living independently will teach children a lot by presenting some difficulties, which, consequently, will add some more experience that may prove essential in their future lives.On the other hand, it is argued that children should stay with their parents for longer for several reasons. Firstly, young people need advice from adults, and no one would be better suited to that than their parents. Secondly, life can be generally harsh, for children in particular. In other words, they might or take unnecessary risks if they mix with the wrong crowd. It is commonly known that young people tend to be by unethical people. To avoid that, being under parental supervision is utterly important for children.To sum up, while people’s opinions may vary, I believe that young people should leave their family home at an early age, while parents ought to provide them with appropriate advice and keep an eye on their well-being.This essay covers the task by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of leaving the family home early in life, and the writer’s opinion has been clearly stated. The arguments for and against have been organised in paragraphs and supported by examples. Accuracy of expression needs some work (see suggested corrections underlined in blue) and in one case sentence structure needs more attention. Overall, assuming the errors were corrected, this essay could score Band 8 in IELTS.;Some individuals believe that it is beneficial for children to leave their family home at the earliest opportunity, while others argue that they should remain with their families for as long as they desire. In my view, there are numerous advantages to children departing from their family home early.On one hand, proponents of early independence argue that young people should leave their parents' home to acquire essential life skills at a young age. They contend that this experience fosters independence and encourages young people to learn valuable lessons from real-life situations, rather than being overly reliant on their parents. For instance, students who attend university in a different city may gain a sense of personal responsibility. Furthermore, navigating the challenges of independent living can equip children with important skills and experiences that will benefit them in their future endeavors.Conversely, some believe that children should remain in their family home longer for several reasons. To begin with, young individuals often require guidance from adults, and their parents are typically the best source of advice. Additionally, life can be quite challenging, especially for children, who may face unnecessary risks by associating with the wrong crowd. It is well-known that young people can fall under the influence of unscrupulous individuals. Thus, being under parental supervision is crucial for their safety and well-being.In conclusion, while opinions on this matter differ, I maintain that young people should be encouraged to leave their family home at an early age, while parents should provide suitable guidance and monitor their children's well-being. This essay effectively addresses the task by discussing both the advantages and disadvantages of early independence and clearly articulates the writer’s perspective. The arguments are organized into coherent paragraphs and supported by relevant examples. With some attention to language accuracy and sentence structure, this essay could achieve a Band 8 score in IELTS.
1333;Some think that young people should be free to choose any career they like, while others say that they should think more realistically about their future. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;"Choosing a future career requires careful consideration. While some people claim that adolescents should be able to pursue a career they would enjoy, others oppose to that, arguing that teenagers should aim for a high-paying job in order to secure a livelihood when they grow up. Given that our life consists of more than just physiological needs, I strongly believe that it is vital to fulfill one’s potential in the career fields that are most compatible with their interests.The youth who choose highly skilled jobs may find it easier to have a fruitful future in a materialistic sense. It is true that some professions, such as engineers or doctors, are well paid and offer more stability compared to work in other, non-professional fields. For example, psychologists usually have higher starting salaries compared to artists; they also rarely lose their jobs in recessions. People who prioritise earning a living might agree that a reliable job is a must for their future and by no means will they take risks to gain employment in a field they are passionate about, that doesn’t pay well.However, it is worth remembering that we are living in a rapidly changing world and the concept of a ‘guaranteed future’ is unrealistic. Even the smartest of us aren’t prophets and it is impossible to foresee many changes in job markets in the future; some high-salaried jobs of today may no longer exist by the time our young people become adults. Therefore, people may choose to pursue their dreams and follow career paths according to their passions and interests now, to avoid having regrets later in life.Having considered the reasons to prefer monetary remuneration over one’s interests, I am convinced that it would be a pity for youths to limit their career choices to highly paid jobs of today. Unforeseen changes in the jobs markets may affect salaries but won’t change the pleasure one derives from doing something they love.";"Selecting a career for the future demands thoughtful reflection. While some argue that young people should follow their passions in choosing a career, others contend that teenagers should focus on securing high-paying jobs to ensure financial stability as adults. However, I firmly believe that it is crucial to realize one’s potential in career paths that align with personal interests, as life encompasses more than just basic physiological needs.While it's true that pursuing skilled professions can lead to a more prosperous future from a financial perspective, such as engineers or doctors who typically enjoy better salaries and job security compared to artists or psychologists, the emphasis on monetary gain can be limiting. Those who prioritize financial security might argue that a stable job is essential for their future and may hesitate to take risks in less lucrative fields they are passionate about.Nevertheless, it’s important to recognize that we live in a rapidly evolving world, making the idea of a ""guaranteed future"" somewhat unrealistic. Even the most astute individuals cannot predict all the changes that will occur in job markets over time; many lucrative positions today could potentially vanish by the time today’s youth enter the workforce. Therefore, pursuing one’s passions and aligning career choices with personal interests may help them avoid future regrets.In light of these considerations, I believe it would be unfortunate for young people to limit their career options solely to today's high-paying jobs. While market fluctuations may affect salaries, they will not diminish the joy of engaging in work that one loves."
1403;Students from rural areas often find it difficult to access university education. Some people think that it should become easier for them to study at universities. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Nowadays, it is acknowledged that students from suburban areas find it tough to receive higher education. Whether it should be made easier for them to access university education becomes an ongoing concern, which incurs a highly-charged debate.Obviously, higher education opportunities bring about benefits to students in multiple ways. For example, higher education becomes increasingly important to senior high school graduates, partly it determines if they have the competitive edge in the job market, and partly because it is seen as a guarantee of a certain level of the mental ability, from the computer literacy that is required by the most employers to the capacities of acquiring new knowledge the soonest possible which is valued by most . With a university degree, students from rural areas obtain a job easily, thereby bettering their living conditions and their family as well.Higher education also, however, to impose a heavy burden on families since the rise in the tuition fees are increasingly beyond those families’ ability to afford. In addition, with the mounting evidence, a university degree is not always a guarantee of seizing a decent job; therefore, their living conditions are likely to able to earn back their tuition fee after graduation. people argue, students from rural areas are not well-advised to pursue a university degree. But I perceive their desire to further their education should not be disrespected and the government should subsidise them to receive higher education.In conclusion, university education should be made fair to everyone, predicated only on their academic performance and mental abilities, rather than their financial capacities and the government should subsidise those students in need.Teacher’s comment: Not all the parts of the task were covered. The writer’s position is relevant to task prompt, the main ideas are also relevant but not all of them are developed well enough. The information is presented coherently, it is evident that the writer progresses from one idea to another.";Today, it is widely recognized that students from suburban areas often face significant challenges in accessing higher education. The question of whether university education should be more accessible to them is a topic of ongoing debate. Clearly, the advantages of higher education are numerous for students. For instance, it plays a crucial role for high school graduates, affecting their competitiveness in the job market and serving as a marker of certain intellectual capabilities. Skills such as computer literacy are increasingly required by employers, and the ability to quickly acquire new knowledge is highly valued.For students from rural areas, obtaining a university degree can facilitate job placement, thereby improving their living conditions and benefiting their families. However, pursuing higher education can also place a substantial financial burden on families, as rising tuition costs often exceed their means. Additionally, there is growing evidence that a university degree does not always guarantee a well-paying job, raising concerns about whether graduates can recoup their tuition costs.Some argue that students from rural areas may not be well-advised to pursue a university education. Nevertheless, I believe their aspirations for further education should be respected, and the government should provide financial assistance to help them access higher learning.In conclusion, access to university education should be equitable and based solely on academic ability and potential, rather than financial status. The government needs to support financially disadvantaged students to ensure that higher education is attainable for all.
809;The Internet is now used all around the world as a source of information and communication. However, it's often controversial, so many people think it needs to be controlled. Others believe there should be no interference whatsoever.Discuss both points of view, and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The Internet has recently become the most widely spread means of communication and knowledge sharing. It is argued by many if any restrictions should be imposed on it. This essay will discuss both views and explain why the Internet should be free from regulations.One group of people consider that the Internet was developed to overcome a government censure, thus any restrictions will destroy its purpose. Despite the fact that there were independent media, it was practically difficult to share news internally and internationally because of low speed of communication methods such as telegraph or post, which lead to the fact that the most common source of information was government authorities who selected the information they wanted to share. Thus, general citizens’ opinion, views and problems were often unheard. This essay agrees that the ability of sharing information freely between people all over the world makes the government to be transparent as everyone’s opinion and problem may be heard. For example, the problems with extinction of wild animals in Baikal region of Russia due to forest cuts was heard only after a massive attack by the media and local citizens and bloggers that would be impossible without the Internet.The others insist that the Internet allows to people share not only useful knowledge, problems and new, but also violent content. The supporters of the view believe that having an easy access to such content, for example assault, production of bombs, people become prompt to criminal behaviour. Although, the Internet makes the violent information more available, the essay suggests that if an individual want to find violent information, he would do it even in the absence of the Internet. Moreover, recent researches conducted by criminalists uncovered that the increase in the number of criminal offenses is not directly correlated with Internet coverage.In conclusion, although the Internet contains violent content, if needed it may be accessed by interested people from other sources of informations, meanwhile independent flow of information allows individuals to attract attention to their local and even global problems which may be hidden by governments without free Internet.;The Internet has emerged as the most pervasive platform for communication and knowledge sharing in recent times. There is considerable debate regarding whether any regulations should be enforced upon it. This essay will explore both perspectives and argue in favor of keeping the Internet free from restrictions.One perspective holds that the Internet was created to bypass government censorship, and that imposing any limitations would undermine its fundamental purpose. While independent media have existed, the slow communication methods of the past, such as telegraphs and postal services, made it challenging to share news both domestically and internationally. As a result, government authorities often became the primary sources of information, selectively sharing what they deemed appropriate. Consequently, the voices, opinions, and concerns of ordinary citizens were frequently overlooked. This essay contends that the freedom to share information around the globe fosters governmental transparency, as it enables diverse perspectives and issues to be acknowledged. For instance, the environmental crisis concerning the extinction of wildlife in Russia's Baikal region only gained attention after a concerted effort by media, local citizens, and bloggers—a movement that would have been inconceivable without the Internet.On the other hand, some argue that the Internet facilitates the dissemination of not only valuable knowledge and pressing issues but also violent content. Advocates of this viewpoint contend that the easy accessibility of such information, including materials on assaults and bomb-making, can desensitize individuals to violence and encourage criminal behavior. However, this essay posits that if someone is determined to seek out violent content, they will do so regardless of the Internet’s presence. Additionally, recent studies conducted by criminologists have shown that the rise in criminal activities does not have a direct correlation with Internet accessibility.In conclusion, while the Internet does host violent material, individuals interested in such content can find it through other channels as well. Conversely, the unrestricted flow of information empowers people to shine a light on local and global issues that may be obscured by governmental control, which underscores the importance of maintaining a free Internet.
1397;The Internet when used as a source of information, has more drawbacks than advantages. To what extent do you agree with this statement?;Some people believe that internet access creates problems. There are several possible reasons why it can happen.Firstly, some data may be unverifiable. For example, they search for a data, there would be lots of choices that would appear on the screen. They would not be sure if the information they are reading is accurate. Some sources may even have outdated . Secondly, some sites may be unreliable. For instance, people sign up on one site that sells goods online. The goods would be paid for by a credit card, but the purchaser would not receive anything. And finally, not everything is available through the net. When my friend had tried to research for some pictures of 18th century paintings, he did not find any results. Then he was told by his teacher that they would only be available in the library.Others believe that the Internet is very useful and these are the justifications. Firstly, it is hard to get the same data, that is available through the Internet by other means. For example, if the directory information could not give me the accurate address and contact number of a place I to visit, I normally check that information on the Internet. In just one click, I would get all the details of that company. Secondly, research becomes more comprehensive. For instance, I do not have to buy lots of reading materials to complete my research. Most of the needed information can be found if I have Internet access. And finally, data is easily compared and contrasted. researched a study about overweight children a decade ago and at presentwas able to finish his research in just one day, as compared to a week if he would not use the Internet.In conclusion, let me reiterate that the Internet plays a big role in our life, because it makes data retrieval and comparison easier.;"Some individuals argue that internet access can lead to various issues. There are several reasons why this may occur. Firstly, much of the information available online may be unverifiable. When searching for data, users are often bombarded with numerous options, making it difficult to ascertain which sources are accurate and reliable. Additionally, some sources may contain outdated information. Secondly, certain websites are unreliable. For instance, when individuals purchase items from online retailers, they may make payments using their credit cards but end up not receiving the products. Lastly, not all information is accessible online. For example, when a friend attempted to find pictures of 18th-century paintings, he was unable to locate any online and later learned from his teacher that such resources could only be found in the library.Conversely, many people believe that the internet is incredibly beneficial for several reasons. Firstly, obtaining information online is often more challenging through traditional means. For example, if directory services fail to provide accurate addresses or contact details for a place I intend to visit, I usually rely on the internet for the correct information, which can be found with just a click. Secondly, research becomes more extensive and efficient. I no longer need to purchase numerous materials to gather data; most of the required information can be accessed online if I have internet connectivity. Finally, comparing and contrasting information is much simpler. For instance, when conducting research on overweight children and examining studies from a decade ago, I was able to complete my project in just one day, whereas it would have taken me a week without internet access.In conclusion, I want to emphasize that the internet plays a significant role in our lives by simplifying the processes of data retrieval and comparison."

109;The advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's life, English is one of the biggest common language in the world. It is often argued that the benefits of learning English as a global language will superior to its drawbacks continueously. I completely agree with this idea due to the fact that English is one of the easiest language to learn and most education system in the world involve English as one of the courses.English should be continue to use as a global langauge because it is easy to learn. Each language in the world involves different movings of the tongue in the mouth, but some of the languages have similar tongue positions with English, such as Italian, Spanish and French. It will be difficult for people in the world to start adapting a new language and using completely different tongue positions. For example, chinese, one of the most challengeable langauge in the world, it mostly does not need the support of the tongue to touch the teeth or anything else. It is hard for people with other mother language to adapt the pronounciation. Therefore, one of the biggest advantages of English as a common language is the easyness of it.In addition to the easyness of English, numorous education systems in the world include English as one of the important subjects to learn support the benefits of English that will continue to overseed its disadvantages. Since English as one of the spreading languages in the world lasts for many years. A lots of generations learn English since their childhood and English already take a huge part of their educational studies. It is hard for people to abandon this language and step out of their comfort zone. For instance, one of my best chilldhood friend learn English for almost 6 years, but since she went to Spain for two years as exchange students, she get used to the way of learn English, instead of Spanish, so she fell her grade there. It is clear that English as one of the essential courses in world, it has an important connection with the education system globally and it has a huge influence in our studies.In conclusion, the easyness of learning English and the crucial role of it in the educations system support my opinion that I completely believe that the advantages of spreading English as an important language in the world will keep outweigh its flaws.;In today's world, English stands out as one of the most widely spoken languages globally. Many argue that the advantages of learning English as a universal language far outweigh its drawbacks, and I wholeheartedly agree. This is primarily because English is among the easier languages to learn, and it is a significant part of education systems across the globe.English should continue to serve as a global language due to its accessibility. Different languages require various tongue movements, but some languages, such as Italian, Spanish, and French, share similarities with English in terms of tongue positioning. For many people, adapting to a completely new language that demands different tongue movements can be quite challenging. For instance, Chinese is one of the most difficult languages to learn, as it requires less tongue contact with the teeth and other parts of the mouth, making accurate pronunciation difficult for non-native learners. Thus, one of the major advantages of English as a common language lies in its relative ease of learning.In addition to its accessibility, numerous education systems worldwide include English as a vital subject, reinforcing the benefits of English and ensuring it continues to overshadow its disadvantages. English has been a prominent global language for many years, and countless generations have learned it from a young age, making it an integral part of their education. As such, it is challenging for individuals to abandon a language they’ve grown accustomed to. For example, a close childhood friend of mine studied English for nearly six years but struggled when she went to Spain as an exchange student. She found it hard to adapt to learning in Spanish, and as a result, her grades suffered. This illustrates the significant role English plays in the global education system and its profound impact on our studies.In conclusion, the ease of learning English and its essential role in education bolster my belief that the benefits of promoting English as a key language in the world will continue to outweigh its limitations.
248;The bar chart below describes some changes about the percentage of people were born in Australia and who were born outside Australia living in urban, rural and town between 1995 and 2010.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;this above bar chart it is depicts the percent flock of people born in Australia otherwise people was born outside , it is clarify from the graph that we leer the a several of bars will making comparsing between them , according what is elucidate in 1995 we noitced the citzens are more likely to accomndtion into cities and also rural , for example we see nearly 50 prepertion whear as 20% in rural and comparsing to the 2010 i think the bar of cities it is kind of rise , in other hand we have very significantly decrease in rural , while the people are born out nation in 1995 it is prefer to live in cities etheir , we see the bar it is 60 percent and he is growing up very observe which in 2010 they have 80% , finaily to sum up we could say that it is very common to see like this digram bar.;The bar chart above illustrates the percentage of people born in Australia compared to those born outside the country. From the graph, we can observe several bars that allow for comparison over time. In 1995, it was evident that citizens were more likely to reside in cities (approximately 50%) rather than rural areas (around 20%). By 2010, the percentage of city dwellers had risen, while there was a significant decline in the rural population. Additionally, in 1995, individuals born outside Australia also preferred urban living, with about 60% choosing cities. This trend increased in 2010, reaching approximately 80%. In conclusion, this bar chart effectively conveys these demographic trends.
1170;The bar chart below gives information about vehicle ownership in China.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information.;The chart describes the data about vehicle ownership in a particular country, China from 1987 to 1999.Overall, the highest vehicle ownership occurred in the year 1999 while the lowest trend was recorded in the year 1987.According to the chart, China has less than 500 vehicle per thousand people during 1987. It is evident that there is an increment in the figures throughout the years. Within the two year interval, the number of vehicle ownership was already at 500. In 1991, 900 vehicle per thousand people were already in possession as depicted in the graph. In between 1991 to 1995, it went up gradually to nearly a thousand. Furthermore, the vehicle ownership doubled in number in 1995. Also, in an unspecified period of time, the number of vehicle possession in that country were approximately 3,000. By the end of year 1999, the numbers rose significantly to 4,100 vehicle per thousand people.;The chart illustrates vehicle ownership in China from 1987 to 1999. Overall, the peak in vehicle ownership occurred in 1999, while the lowest figure was recorded in 1987. Initially, in 1987, China had fewer than 500 vehicles per thousand people. However, there was a noticeable increase in ownership figures over the years. By 1989, the number of vehicles per thousand reached 500. In 1991, this figure rose to 900 vehicles per thousand. Between 1991 and 1995, vehicle ownership continued to grow gradually, nearing a total of 1,000 vehicles. Notably, by 1995, ownership had doubled. At some point thereafter, vehicle possession surged to approximately 3,000 vehicles per thousand people. By the end of 1999, the number had significantly increased to 4,100 vehicles per thousand people.
702;The bar chart below shows the number of houses built per year in two cities, Derby and Nottingham, Between 2000 and 2009. Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.You should write at least 150 words.;Information is presented by the bar chart which illustrates the figure for houses built each year in Derby and Nottingham over a ten-year period from 2000 to 2009. Overall, it can be seen that there was a clear trend that houses in Derby were built more than that in Nottingham each year over the survey period, except for the year 2000, 2001 and 2007.Turning to the first main feature, there were just under 50 houses which were constructed in Derby for the first two years between 2000 and 2001, while the number of houses in Nottingham was an exact 50 and a little more than 50 in 2000 and 2001 respectively. The figure for houses in Derby then increased considerably to approximately 75 in 2002, which exceeded the number of houses in Nottingham, and plateaued at more than 100 until 2006. On the contrary, in 2002 the chart depicts a noticeable decline in the number of houses in Nottingham to less than 25. Nevertheless, the number of houses in Nottingham rebounded and rose to around 75 in 2005 before dropping suddenly to nearly zero in 2006.Turning to another main feature, whereas in 2007 the figure for houses in Derby remained unchanged at above 100, the number of houses in Nottingham soared to almost 200, exceeding the number of houses in Derby. The last key feature to point out is that the number of houses in Derby jumped dramatically to nearly 350 by 2009 while the number of houses in Nottingham experienced the third drop to almost zero in 2008 before the number of houses in Nottingham increased dramatically to 250 in 2009.;The bar chart presents data on the annual number of houses constructed in Derby and Nottingham over a ten-year period from 2000 to 2009. Overall, it is evident that Derby consistently saw more houses built each year compared to Nottingham, with the exception of the years 2000, 2001, and 2007.Focusing on the initial observation, slightly fewer than 50 houses were built in Derby during the first two years, while Nottingham had exactly 50 houses in 2000 and a little over 50 in 2001. In 2002, the number of houses in Derby saw a significant rise to approximately 75, surpassing Nottingham's figures, which experienced a sharp decline to below 25 that same year. From 2002 to 2006, Derby's construction numbers plateaued at over 100. Meanwhile, Nottingham's numbers rebounded to about 75 in 2005, only to plummet again to nearly zero in 2006.Looking at 2007, Derby's housing numbers remained stable at above 100, while Nottingham saw a dramatic increase to nearly 200, surpassing Derby for that year. The final notable trend is in 2009, when Derby's housing construction surged to almost 350. In contrast, Nottingham's numbers dropped to near zero in 2008, before rebounding sharply to 250 in 2009.
530;The bar chart below shows the numbers of men and women attending various evening courses at an adult education centre in the year 2009. The pie chart gives information about the ages of these course participants.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar chart shows what are the tendences of men and women in attending evening courses in an adult education centre during 2009 in a scale of 0 to 40 people, while the pie chart shows the percentages of ages of the participants in these courses.Fist of all, the most striking information is that women were largely more present in languages and painting courses than men, and that the vast majority of the participants in the overall courses were 50 years old or over.To begin with, it is clearly demonstrated that there were more women than men in all courses, except in sculture. In fact, men attended to language and drama courses were twice as less than women. Women were 40 in language courses and 20 in drama. Men were also slightly less in paiting, around 25 people, compared to women who were 30 at this course. However, in sculpture, men tended to be more present, as they were 10, which is roughly the double of the number of women who were present.Secondly, there was a marked tendence for people aged from 50 and over to attend a these courses, as they were slighlty more than two fifth. Just over a quarter of the people were between 40 and 49, while those who were 30-39 were just 16%. Finally, the youngest ones were not very present. In fact, the 20-29 years old group represented just 11%, while the under 20 were barely the half, with 5%.To conclude, it can be seen that the vast majority of the people who attended these evening courses were aged from 40 to 50 and over. Moreover, women tended to attend much more at all courses than men except for sculpture.;The bar chart illustrates the trends in attendance among men and women at evening courses in an adult education center during 2009, measured on a scale of 0 to 40 participants. In contrast, the pie chart depicts the age distribution of the participants in these courses.The most notable finding is that women significantly outnumbered men in language and painting courses, while the majority of all participants were aged 50 and above.Initially, it is evident that women attended all courses in greater numbers than men, with the exception of sculpture. Specifically, in language and drama courses, men's attendance was only half that of women's. Women numbered 40 in language courses and 20 in drama, while men had slightly fewer participants in painting, with around 25 men compared to 30 women. In sculpture, however, men were more prevalent, totaling 10 participants, which is approximately twice the number of women.Additionally, a clear trend emerged showing that individuals aged 50 and over comprised just over two-fifths of the total attendees. More than a quarter were aged between 40 and 49, while those in the 30-39 age bracket represented just 16%. The younger age groups had limited representation, with individuals aged 20-29 making up only 11%, and those under 20 accounting for just 5%.In conclusion, the data indicates that a significant majority of participants in these evening courses were aged 40 and above. Furthermore, women generally attended more than men in all courses, with the exception of sculpture.
960;The bar chart below shows the percentage of unemployed graduates, aged 20-24, in one European country over a two-year period.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and making comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart demonstrates the unemployed graduates who are between 20 and 24 years old by gender in percentage. The survey is conducted in one European country from 2008 to 2009.In general, the unemployment rates in males over a two-year period were higher than the females. The highest rate of unemployment in males was approximately 22% in Oct 2009, reaching nearly 40% more than females. Whereas the unemployment for female graduates in percentage was 6% reported in Apr 08, July 08 and Apr 09 which were the lowest rate of unemployment for graduates over the period.First of all, there was a slight decline in the unemployment rates for all graduates in the beginning of year, from 10% in Jan 08 to 7% in Apr 08 in males whilst female graduates decreasing from 7.5% to 6% . The unemployment for both genders in July 2008 remained same rates as previous. An increase in percentage of unemployed graduates in Oct 08 took nearly twofold of last month with males by 16% and females by 11%. Subsequently, a fall in the unemployment rates for all graduates were recorded in Jan 09, by 12.5% in men and 8% in women. A further reduction in the rate of unemployed female graduates in Apr 09 was 6% whilst there was no change in the male graduates. Afterwards, the unemployment rates in women returned to 10% in July 09 whereas there was a brief decrease in males by 11%. This was followed by a surge in the unemployment rates for graduates in Oct 09 by 22% for males and 14% for females.;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of unemployed graduates aged 20 to 24 by gender in a specific European country, based on data collected from 2008 to 2009. Overall, the unemployment rates among males during this two-year period were consistently higher than those of females. The peak unemployment rate for males occurred in October 2009, reaching approximately 22%, which was nearly 40% higher than the corresponding rate for females. In contrast, the unemployment rate for female graduates was reported at 6% in April 2008, July 2008, and April 2009, marking the lowest unemployment figures for female graduates throughout the observed period.Initially, there was a slight decline in unemployment rates for all graduates at the beginning of 2008. Male unemployment decreased from 10% in January 2008 to 7% in April 2008, while female unemployment fell from 7.5% to 6%. The unemployment rates for both genders remained stable in July 2008. However, there was a significant increase in unemployed graduates in October 2008, with male unemployment surging by 16% and female unemployment by 11%.Subsequently, a decrease in unemployment rates was recorded for both genders in January 2009, with male unemployment dropping to 12.5% and female to 8%. The rate for female graduates further declined to 6% in April 2009, while the rate for male graduates remained unchanged. Later, the unemployment rate for women increased again to 10% in July 2009, while there was a brief decrease for males to 11%. This was followed by another spike in unemployment rates in October 2009, with 22% for males and 14% for females.
688;The bar chart below shows the total number of minutes (in billions) of telephone calls in Australia, divided into three categories, from 2001- 2008. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The bar chart displays the total number of minutes(in billions) of telephone calls in Australia. There are three types, specifically, local, national and international, and mobiles. Overall, it is clear the number of local telephone calls has the largest from 2001 to 2008, while the other two types, national and international, and mobiles steadily increased the number of telephone calls.Initially, there is a variation in local telephone calls from 2001 to 2008. The number of telephone calls started at 72 billion, and steadily soared and reached a peak of 90 billion in 2005. Then the number of billions slightly reduced and returned to 72 billion in 2008. Nevertheless, the number remained the highest in the three categories.Secondly, national and international, and mobiles can be seen steadily increase the number until 2008. National and international was 38 billion in 2001 and gradually rose up the number and reached the highest number in 2008. Specifically, it was 61 billion. Mobiles started the number only 2 billion in 2001. But the number constantly increased, and suddenly surged to 23 billion and 39 billion in 2006 and 2007 respectively. As a result, the number reached a peak of 46 billion in 2008. The gaps among three categories were quite large in 2001. It was 72, 38, and 2 in local, national and international mobile. And it resulted in a huge reduction of the gap in 2008. It was 72,61, and 46 in local,national and internationalal, and mobiles.;The bar chart illustrates the total duration of telephone calls made in Australia, expressed in billions of minutes. It categorizes calls into three types: local, national and international, and mobile. Overall, it is evident that local calls dominated from 2001 to 2008, while the other two categories, national and international calls as well as mobile calls, showed a consistent upward trend.In the local calls category, there was noticeable fluctuation between 2001 and 2008. Local calls started at 72 billion minutes, reaching a peak of 90 billion in 2005 before experiencing a slight decline, returning to 72 billion in 2008. Despite this dip, local calls remained the highest among the three categories throughout the period.In contrast, national and international calls, along with mobile calls, displayed a steady increase leading up to 2008. National and international calls began at 38 billion in 2001 and gradually climbed to a peak of 61 billion by 2008. Meanwhile, mobile calls started from a modest 2 billion in 2001, but rose significantly, experiencing sharp increases to 23 billion in 2006 and 39 billion in 2007, ultimately reaching 46 billion in 2008. In 2001, there was a significant gap between the three categories, with local calls at 72 billion, national and international calls at 38 billion, and mobile calls at just 2 billion. However, this gap narrowed considerably by 2008, with local calls at 72 billion, national and international calls at 61 billion, and mobile calls at 46 billion.
362;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of how parents in a country spent time taking care of their children in the evening in 2022. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The bar chart demonstrates the proportions in which how parents spent time looking after their kids in the evening in the country, during the year 2022. The figures are given in percentage of time. Overall, there are four activities, including dressing, homework, playing games, and preparing for bed. which can be roughly classified into two groups. On one hand, mothers mainly oversee their children for dressing and homework with some helps from fathers, on the other hand, playing games and preparing for bed are done by both parents. Obviously, fathers spent time significantly less than mothers in all activities.To begin, The proportion of mothers taking care of theri children by dressing was approximately 75 percent which is the majority in the task. Likewise, around a half of homeworks were done by mothers while it was the acitivity which fathers take the most at about 10%.In contrast, both parents mainly took care of their children together to play games and to prepare for bed. Specifically, they both played games with their kids and prepared fot bed around 70 and 50 percent of time respectively. Furthermore, mothers spent 40 percent of time to prepare for bed.;The bar chart illustrates how parents in the country allocated their time caring for their children in the evening throughout 2022, with data presented in percentages. Overall, there are four activities categorized as dressing, homework, playing games, and preparing for bed, which can be divided into two groups: tasks predominantly managed by mothers and those shared by both parents. Mothers primarily handle dressing and homework, often with some assistance from fathers, while both parents engage in playing games and preparing for bed. Notably, fathers spent considerably less time than mothers on all activities.In detail, about 75 percent of the time spent dressing children was conducted by mothers, making it the most substantial portion of this task. Similarly, mothers were responsible for approximately half of the homework, whereas fathers contributed only around 10 percent.Conversely, both parents collaborated significantly in playing games and preparing for bed. They devoted around 70 percent of their time to playing games and about 50 percent to bedtime preparation together. Additionally, mothers dedicated 40 percent of their time specifically to help prepare for bed.
626;The bar chart shows the percentage of the total world population in 4 countries in 1950 and 2002, and projections for 2050.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart depicts the proportion of the total world population in 4 countries in 1950 and 2002, and predictions for 2050. Overall, it can be seen India and China occupy much higher percentage in all periods while the USA, and Japan tend to be much smaller and drop down in 2002.It is clear that India steadily increases the percentage of its population since 1950. Specifically, the percentage in each period is 15 percent, around 17 percent, and will be approximately 18 percent, in 1950, 2002, and 2050 respectively. In contrast, China used to be the highest percentage of population in 1950 and 2002. The each percentage indicates more than 23 percent in 1950 and dropped to 20 percent in 2002. Furthermore, the prediction about population will plummet to 15 percent.Interestingly, firstly Japan was the smallest percentage in 4 countries in 1950 and slightly goes down in 2002. The percentage seems to be about 4 percent in 1950 and its percentage will plummet to approximately 1 percent in 2050. The USA also goes down population 5 percent in 2002, but the percentage will stay the same in 2050.;The bar chart illustrates the share of the global population represented by four countries—India, China, the USA, and Japan—during the years 1950, 2002, and projected for 2050. Overall, it is evident that India and China consistently hold a larger share of the population across all periods, while the USA and Japan exhibit smaller percentages, with a noticeable decline for both by 2002.India's population percentage has shown a steady increase since 1950, rising from about 15% in that year to approximately 17% in 2002, with an expected increase to around 18% by 2050. In contrast, China held the highest population percentage in both 1950 and 2002, at over 23% in 1950 but decreasing to 20% in 2002. The forecast indicates a further decline to 15% in 2050.Japan, which had the lowest population percentage among the four countries in 1950, experienced a slight decrease by 2002, with its share dropping from around 4% in 1950 to an anticipated plummet to roughly 1% by 2050. Similarly, the USA's percentage decreased to about 5% in 2002 but is projected to remain stable through 2050.
1136;The bar chart shows the scores of teams A, B and C over four different seasons.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The graphic gives information about the scores obtained by three teams (A, B and C) in four seasons. Team B compared to the other two is that obtained more points over the years. On the other hand, teams A and B mantain their scores low. 2004 is the year in which there is less discrepancy in the scores of the three teams. Instead, in 2002 there is more disparity.Over the years the three teams always modify their score. The score of each of the teams rises and then goes down. For instance, the scores of team A is that subjected to more modifications. It start very low. In 2003 were registered an increase and then the points rapidly go up in 2003. The scores changed from 11 points to 35. After that, the points start to diminish again. Team B obtained always the highest scores over the years. However also this team's score is subject to various change. The score was very high in 2002 and is just 43 in 2004. In 2005 the score raises again. Team C totalise the lowest score over the years, and the scores are subjected just to small variations.2004 is the year in which there is less disparity between the score of team B and the other two. Team A in 2004 had totalised 35 point and team B only 8 point more. Even if the points of team C are 12, the overall score's dicrepancy is less than in other year. Indeed, in 2002 there is a huge dicrepancy concerning the scores of the teams. Team B obtained 82 points while the other two teams obtained respectively 5 points (team A) and 10 points (team B).;"The graphic illustrates the scores achieved by three teams (A, B, and C) across four seasons. Team B consistently secured the highest points over the years, while Teams A and C maintained relatively low scores. Notably, 2004 was the year with the smallest difference in scores among the three teams, in contrast to 2002, which exhibited a significant disparity.Throughout the years, each team’s score fluctuated, experiencing both increases and decreases. Team A underwent the most changes, starting from a low score. In 2003, Team A experienced a notable rise, with scores jumping from 11 points to 35 before beginning to decline again. Team B consistently achieved the highest scores, though its performance also varied; it peaked at 82 points in 2002 but dropped to 43 points in 2004, before rebounding in 2005. Team C consistently had the lowest score, with only minor variations throughout the seasons.The year 2004 showcased the least discrepancy between Team B and the others, as Team A finished with 35 points, just 8 points higher than Team B’s score. Meanwhile, Team C scored 12 points, contributing to a narrower overall score range compared to previous years, particularly 2002, when Team B’s 82 points starkly contrasted with Team A’s 5 points and Team C’s 10 points."
272;The bar charts below show the number of hours each teacher spent teaching in different schools in four different countries in 2001.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar graph illustrates the amount of teaching hours of teacher in primary, lower secondary and upper secondary schools in Japan, Spain, Iceland and the USA. It's clearly can seen the teacher who teach higher students spend time to teach more than lower.In european countries, their teacher have to teach nearly hours in upper secondary schools at 900 hours. Thus, Iceland and Spain still has big gap in primary and lower secondary schools. The teacher in primary schools in Iceland spend almost 600 hours which shorter time than Spain (more than 600 hours). Same way in lower secondary schools, Iceland and Spain teacher spend 600 and 750 hours, respectively.In other countries, teachers in Japan spend the smallest time of four countries in average at 600, 625 and 650 hours. In the USA, teachers spend the largest time of teaching at 625, 950 and almost 1200 hours in primary lower secondary and upper secondary schools.;The bar graph displays the number of teaching hours for educators in primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary schools across Japan, Spain, Iceland, and the USA. It is evident that teachers instructing older students tend to spend more hours teaching compared to those in lower grade levels.In European nations, teachers in upper secondary schools are required to teach nearly 900 hours. However, there is a significant disparity in teaching hours at the primary and lower secondary levels between Iceland and Spain. Specifically, teachers in Iceland's primary schools teach close to 600 hours, which is less than their counterparts in Spain, who teach over 600 hours. A similar trend is observed in lower secondary schools, where teachers in Iceland and Spain dedicate 600 and 750 hours, respectively.In contrast, teachers in Japan average the fewest teaching hours among the four countries, spending around 600, 625, and 650 hours in primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary schools. Conversely, in the USA, teachers invest the most time, with teaching hours reaching 625, 950, and nearly 1200 hours in primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary schools, respectively.
314;The bar charts below shows the number of visits to a community website in the first and second year of use.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and mae comparisons with relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the quantity of visits by the thousands paid to a community website within the first two years of use.Overall, there is a greater upward trend from the second year of use compared to the first year of use. In addition to that, in both years the website undergoes a drastic fluctuation in numbers. It can be observed that initially in the month of September, number of visits in the first year of use are lower than second year of use, but numbers of the former subsequently surpasses the latter in the final month of August.In regards to the first year of use, quantity of visits increases from about 2000 visits in September to 10000 visits within 2 months and remains constant for another month. Following that, numbers plummet from December to February, reaching a low-point of less than approximately 500 visits. The numbers rise gradually from February onwards until it reaches it's highest at 15000 by August.On the other hand, during the second year of use, the number of visits rises sharply from about 2500 visits to around 17500 visits. Soon, the visits dip to 10000 only by February, persisting to March. The trend then increases steadily until it touches roughly 22500 visits in July, but drops once again to less than 13000.;The bar chart depicts the number of visits, measured in thousands, to a community website during its first two years of operation. Overall, there is a significant upward trend observed in the second year compared to the first year. Additionally, both years exhibit notable fluctuations in visit counts. Initially, in September of the first year, the number of visits is lower than in the second year, but by August of the first year, this figure surpasses that of the second year.In the first year, visits start at approximately 2,000 in September, rising to 10,000 within two months, and then remaining stable for an additional month. However, from December to February, visits experience a sharp decline, dropping to around 500. A gradual increase begins in February, culminating in a peak of 15,000 visits by August.In contrast, the second year sees visits surge from about 2,500 to approximately 17,500. This spike is followed by a dip to around 10,000 visits by February, which persists into March. After this, the trend rises steadily, reaching roughly 22,500 visits in July, only to fall once more to below 13,000.
1408;The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise age limit for the younger drivers and to lower age limit for the aged ones. Do you agree?;With the rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the with hush and rush lifestyles of drivers today, traffic accidents seem to be escalating in our society. partly to number of traffic accidents but surely not as the main factor.Those who agree with would view young drivers assuming under 18 years old and older drivers to be reckless and therefore would be more prone to traffic accidents on the road. Lack of experience, forgetfulness, carelessness and poor fitness condition may be reasons for limiting age of drivers.On the other hand, I would think that age is only a small determinant and we need to look at more effective measure such as reducing number of vehicles on the road through car pool, implementing more stringent regulations on alcohol drink driving and possibly to revise on the standard of driving test for young and old drivers on the road. Many drivers who are stuck in traffic jams also have busy lifestyles and therefore tend to become very stressed or distracted on the road. Thus I would think the government may have to look ways to improve road infrastructure and traffic jams to deter or reduce accidents on the road.To sum up, age is only one of the many contributors for accidents but I do not agree that age for the elderly and raising age limit for the younger drivers is the best method. As mentioned in my third paragraph, we need to look at other more effective measures which deal with the underlying problems in the society which lead to traffic accidents.;The rapid increase in the number of vehicles, combined with the fast-paced lifestyles of today’s drivers, has contributed to a rise in traffic accidents in our society. While the number of vehicles on the road plays a role in this issue, it is not the sole factor. Some people believe that young drivers (particularly those under 18) and older drivers tend to be more reckless and are therefore more likely to be involved in accidents. Factors such as inexperience, forgetfulness, carelessness, and diminished physical fitness may justify age restrictions for drivers. However, I contend that age is just one small factor among many. We should focus on more effective solutions, such as reducing the number of vehicles on the road through carpooling, enforcing stricter regulations on drinking and driving, and possibly revising the standards for driving tests for both young and older drivers. Additionally, many drivers caught in traffic jams lead busy lives and often find themselves stressed or distracted while on the road. Therefore, I believe the government should explore ways to improve road infrastructure and alleviate traffic congestion to help reduce accidents.In conclusion, while age is one of several contributing factors to traffic accidents, I do not agree that simply increasing the age limit for younger drivers or imposing stricter regulations on older drivers is the best solution. As I outlined in my earlier points, we need to address the underlying societal issues that contribute to these accidents with more comprehensive measures.
1414;The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise the age limit for younger drivers and to lower the age limit for aged drivers. Do you agree ?;Traffic accidents are on the rise these days. Most of the accidents injuries or death. Research have found that most of the accidents are caused by inexperienced drivers, for example young drivers.Young drivers tend to be more daring and are unable to avoid a crush when they face one. They tend to be more daring after drinking alcohol at night and this causes them to lose control of the car. Drunk driving will not only risk a person’s own life but may also cause an life to be lost.The government should encourage the driving to conduct driving lessons for drivers for a longer period. This will give them a clear picture about how accidents happen and teach them about the safety of others on the road. Drivers that have been in an accident after drunk driving should be from driving for at least two years and be given driving lessons again.However, for the aged drivers, the government should not only the age limit but also check the capability of the aged drivers for instance eyesight, hearing and other related health conditions to ensure safe driving. It does not mean that an aged person not fit to drive and has a problem with the heart but a young or a middle aged person could also have heart failure these days.To conclude, I feel that to raise the of young drivers not the best solution but to about the problems they may encounter on the road and to ban them from driving if they have caused an accident due to carelessness. As for the drivers, as long as they are capable on the road before a certain age and there are no health issues there shouldn’t be a problem.;"Traffic accidents are increasing in frequency these days, often resulting in injuries or fatalities. Research indicates that many of these incidents are attributed to inexperienced drivers, particularly young individuals. Young drivers tend to be more reckless and may struggle to avoid collisions when faced with dangerous situations. Their daring behavior is often exacerbated by alcohol consumption, especially at night, which can lead to a loss of control over their vehicles. Drunk driving not only endangers their own lives but also poses a significant risk to others.The government should promote extended driving lessons for new drivers to provide them with a comprehensive understanding of road safety and accident prevention. Additionally, drivers involved in accidents due to drunk driving should be required to refrain from driving for at least two years and undergo further driving instruction.Regarding older drivers, the government should not only implement an age limit but also assess their driving capabilities by evaluating factors such as eyesight, hearing, and other relevant health conditions to ensure their safety on the road. It's important to note that not all older individuals are unfit to drive; younger or middle-aged people can also face health issues, such as heart problems.In conclusion, I believe that simply raising the age limit for young drivers is not the most effective solution. Instead, we should focus on educating them about the potential dangers they may encounter on the road and enforce driving bans for those who demonstrate reckless behavior leading to accidents. As for older drivers, as long as they are capable and free of significant health issues, there should be no restrictions on their driving."
31;The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;These days it is firmly believed that the most efficient method to teach children in schools how to work together is through team sports. This essay disagrees with the statement since some young students might not enjoy playing sports and because team sports can raise competitiveness amongst children, hence having a negative impact on their friendly relationships.First of all, although it is vital for a children to play sports and keep fit, not everyone is keen on football, rugby and volleyball. Instead, some young students prefer spending their leisure time on other activities such as joining a chorus group or teathre lessons. These activities can encourage cooperation and make children get along with each other, as well. On the other hand, forcing children to play something they doesn't feel comfortable in can make them withdraw from the team game, which would make them feel excluded.In addition, teams sports do not always promote cooperation among players. In some cases, inequities or particularly ambitious behaviours can lead to violent competitiveness, instead. It is generally thought that sport is an extremely selective environment, in fact you need to exercise daily in order to keep fit. If obese children took part in those team sports as well, they could feel isolated because they do not own the perfect body to perform well.In conclusion, although team sports are a great method to teach children how to get along with each other, there are various activities which can encourage cooperation among children, as well. Therefore, it is considerably significant for a school to embrace diversity and make children play with what they really like, instead of forcing them to do something they feel they don't belong.;Nowadays, it is widely believed that team sports are the most effective way to teach children cooperation in schools. However, this essay challenges that notion, as some young students may not enjoy participating in sports, and team sports can foster competitiveness among children, potentially harming their friendships.Firstly, while engaging in sports is important for children’s fitness, not every child is interested in activities like football, rugby, or volleyball. Many young students prefer to spend their free time participating in other activities such as choir or drama classes. These alternatives can also promote collaboration and help children build positive relationships. Conversely, pressuring children to engage in sports they are uncomfortable with can lead to feelings of exclusion and disengagement from the group.Moreover, team sports do not always enhance cooperation among players. At times, competition and ambition can create a hostile environment instead of a collaborative one. It is commonly accepted that sports can be quite selective, requiring regular practice to stay fit. Children who are overweight may feel alienated in a team setting due to societal standards of fitness and performance.In conclusion, while team sports can be an effective way to teach children how to interact with one another, there are many other activities that can also foster cooperation. It is crucial for schools to embrace this diversity and allow children to engage in activities they genuinely enjoy, instead of compelling them to participate in something that makes them feel out of place.
982;The chart and table below give information about population figures in Japan.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar graph and table provide information about population numbers of past, present and future in Japan from in the year of 1950 to 2055. It can be observed that numbers of total population and elderly people changes between these years.Overall, Japan's population rose until 2005 and drops from that point as future prediction indicates. Likewise, the population of aged 65 or over rose until certain point.Taking a closer look at the graph, it can be seen that population is increased regularly from 1950 to 2005. While it was 84.1 millions in the year 1950, it is peaked in 2005 with reaching 127.8 millions. However, it will decrease from 2005 to 2055 with reaching 89.9 millions.On the other hand, if we look at the table, we can see that elderly people's population rose from 4.1 millions in 1950 to 25.7 million in 2005. The increase is expected until 2035 with predicting to reach 37.2 millions, however, it would drop to 36.5 millions in 2055.;The bar graph and table present data on Japan's population from 1950 to 2055, highlighting changes in both the total population and the number of elderly individuals over this period.The overall trend indicates that Japan's population increased until 2005 before beginning to decline, according to future projections. Similarly, the population of individuals aged 65 and older rose to a certain extent during this timeframe.Examining the graph more closely, we can see a steady rise in the population from 1950 to 2005. The population reached 84.1 million in 1950 and peaked at 127.8 million in 2005. However, forecasts suggest that this figure will decrease to 89.9 million by 2055.In contrast, the table reveals that the elderly population grew significantly, rising from 4.1 million in 1950 to 25.7 million in 2005. This upward trend is expected to continue until 2035, with projections estimating that the number will reach 37.2 million. However, it is anticipated that this number will decline slightly to 36.5 million by 2055.
664;The chart below gives information about global population percentages and distribution of wealth by region.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The chart indicates information about global population percentages and distribution of wealth by eight regions. Clearly, three regions contribute to global wealth remarkably higher than others, while the five regions' distribution of wealth is all less than five percent.To begin with, these three regions, North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacefic can be seen much high percentage. Specifically, it is close to 35 percent, 30 percent, and nearly 25 percent, in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacefic respectively. Noticeable point is that North America's population is the sixth highest. In contrast, the distribution of wealth percentage reached a peak of nearly 35 percent.Secondly, China has the highest population. Specifically, it is close to a quarter, while the second and third countries have approximately 15 percent. In contrast, the distribution of wealth is not so larger than other countries. Although Europe's population is 15 percent and the distribution of wealth is 30 percent, the percentage of distribution of wealth in China is approximately three percent. This is only one-tenths, compared with Europe. Another noteworthy point is Latin America and Caribean. This is the only region the percentage of the population and global wealth is not significantly wide. It is more than six percentage of the population and around four percentage of global wealth.;The chart provides data on global population percentages and wealth distribution across eight regions. It is evident that three regions—North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific—contribute significantly more to global wealth compared to the other five regions, each of which accounts for less than five percent of the overall wealth.To begin with, North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific exhibit notably high wealth distribution percentages, with figures of approximately 35 percent, 30 percent, and nearly 25 percent respectively. Interestingly, North America ranks as the sixth highest in terms of population, yet its share of global wealth reaches nearly 35 percent.On the other hand, China has the largest population, comprising close to a quarter of the global total, while the second and third most populous countries account for around 15 percent each. However, China's wealth distribution is relatively low, approximating only three percent, a stark contrast to Europe's 30 percent wealth distribution, despite Europe having a similar population percentage of about 15 percent.Additionally, it's worth noting that in Latin America and the Caribbean, the disparity between population percentage and global wealth is the smallest. This region comprises just over six percent of the global population and contributes around four percent to global wealth.

1128;The chart below shows numbers of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles travelled (PMT) by transportation type in 2002.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The chart illustrates numbers of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles travelled in 2002. It is divided into five transportation type: by commuter rail, by heavy rail, by light rail, by bus and by demand response.Overall, we notice the highest number of incident and injuries is due to transportation by demand response, while the use of commuter rail has the lowest number of these accidents. The number of injuries is lower than incident in all cases.In the case of commuter rail, the number of incidents which represents less than 30 incidents per 100 million PMT is almost equal to the number of injuries. The graph shows some similarities when we use light rail or bus, especially in regards of incidents. The numbers of incidents in both cases are about 75 incidents per 100 million PMT. However, the number of injuries increases from approximately 40 to 60 injuries per 100 million PMT. The transportation by demand response is responsible of more than 250 incidents and 150 injuries per 100 million PMT.;The chart presents the number of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles traveled in 2002, categorized by five types of transportation: commuter rail, heavy rail, light rail, bus, and demand response. Overall, demand response transportation experiences the highest rate of incidents and injuries, whereas commuter rail has the lowest. In all cases, the number of injuries is consistently lower than the number of incidents.For commuter rail, incidents amount to fewer than 30 per 100 million passenger miles traveled, closely matching the number of injuries. A similar trend can be observed with light rail and bus transportation, where the incident rates are approximately 75 per 100 million passenger miles traveled. However, the number of injuries increases from around 40 to 60 per 100 million passenger miles for these modes. Demand response transportation accounts for over 250 incidents and 150 injuries per 100 million passenger miles traveled.
1072;The chart below shows the amount of leisure time enjoyed by men and women of different employment status.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar chart illustrates the information about how long male people and female people spent their time on leisure activities according to the sorts of job.Overall, it is clear that, the majority of those who retire their occupation or are not in employment, spent most of the time on leisure activities. Plus, male people were inclined to enjoy more time on chilling activities than females.Looking at the males in more detail, the figures for retired or unemployed male guys showed the highest range with over 80 hours in a week, meanwhile, other guys who obtained full-time job spent approximately 42 hours per week.With regard to women, most of them who finished their working life or were not yet to be employed had just under 80 hours for leisure time in every week, but there were just roughly 40 hours which was spent by women who were in charge hosewives, full-time job and part-time employment.;The bar chart provides insights into the amount of time males and females dedicate to leisure activities based on their employment status. Overall, it is evident that those who are retired or unemployed tend to spend the most time on leisure pursuits. Additionally, males generally engage in more leisure activities compared to females. Focusing on males, retired or unemployed individuals averaged over 80 hours per week devoted to leisure, while those in full-time positions spent approximately 42 hours weekly on such activities. In contrast, most women who were retired or not employed reported just under 80 hours of leisure time each week. Conversely, women in roles such as housewives, full-time workers, or part-time employees spent roughly 40 hours on leisure activities.

Overall, it shows that both high-income and average-income individuals spend significantly more on hamburgers, while spending on pizza is fairly consistent across all income groups.The high-income group allocates around $45 to hamburgers, exceeding the average-income group's expenditure of about $33 and the low-income group's spending of approximately $14. In contrast, high-income individuals spend about $17 on fish and chips, which is less than the average-income group's spending of around $25.Spending on pizza is generally low across all income brackets, except for the high-income group, where pizza expenses surpass those for fish and chips. The expenditure on hamburgers among the low-income population is considerably lower compared to both the high and average-income groups. Interestingly, the amount spent on fish and chips is similar for the high-income group at about $17, but the average-income group spends the most on this category. In terms of pizza, low-income individuals spend only about $7, which is significantly lower than the amounts spent by the high and average-income groups.

96;The chart below shows the expenditure on three categories among different age groups of residents in the UK in 2004.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of total allocation of expenses in three major categories among the citizens of the United Kingdom from five different age groups in the year 2004.Overall, the spending on food and drink continuously increased as the residents reached the older ages. Moreover, spending on entertainment activities also incresased but declined when reaching the later age, while going to a restaurant and hotel was its peak during early age and its lowest was upon reaching the retirement age.Food and drink are part of our daily necessisties, and as a family member grows in number, the more food and drink a family consumed. Over other categories, food and drink are more essential and priority of every residents as the total spending of it increased every fifteen years. This explains why the total expenditure of residents in the UK is mostly on food and drink. From age under 30 with almost 7% only, it sharply increased up to 23% in age 76 and above.In addition, expenses on entertainment reached its peak level of 23%, the same percentage with food and drink but in different age goup, in 61 to 75. In this stage, people already reached the retirement age wherein entertainment activities became a hobby while still having energy. But upon reaching 76 years and above, it declined to just 13%. However, expenditure in eating on a restaurant and staycation on a hotel were high with 14% under 30 years of age, while it dramatically decreased to below 3% upon reaching 61 to 75 years of age.;"The bar chart presents the distribution of total expenses among three primary categories across various age groups of citizens in the United Kingdom in 2004.In general, expenditure on food and drink consistently rose as individuals aged. Similarly, spending on entertainment increased but saw a decline in the later years; dining out and hotel stays peaked during younger ages and hit their lowest point upon reaching retirement.Food and drink are fundamental necessities, and as family size grows, so does consumption in these areas. Compared to other categories, food and drink remain essential priorities for residents, with expenditures rising every fifteen years. This trend accounts for the predominant share of total spending in the UK being on food and drink. For instance, spending under 30 years of age was nearly 7%, but this figure surged to 23% for those aged 76 and above.Additionally, entertainment expenses peaked at 23% for the 61 to 75 age group, matching the spending on food and drink but in different demographics. At this stage, many have reached retirement and engage in entertainment activities as hobbies while still possessing energy. However, once individuals reach the age of 76 and above, entertainment spending drops to just 13%. In contrast, expenditures on dining at restaurants and hotel stays were notably high at 14% for those under 30 years but saw a dramatic decline to below 3% for individuals aged 61 to 75."

433;The dangers of smoking are well known, yet many people continue with this habit.What are the causes of this? How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is very easy to find someone who smokes in today's society. Even though we were taught that smoke is harmful, we see people exhaling this thick fog everyday partly because some people think that it is cool and it can be purchased almost at every store. This essay will discuss deeply about what causes people to smoke and how this issue can be alleviated.Firstly, part of the society believes that it is trendy to smoke. In many pop culture, such as songs, movies, and novels portray smoking possitively. A comedy show that I have seen illustrates one of the character that smokes to be more cool, giving this character an untouchable aura, whilst other characters that did not smoke seem tangible and therefore mundane. Furthermore, cigarettes are easily accessable in any store. A recent study proved that over 80% of those eager to smoke for the first time actually started this behavior because they can buy it from their local shops. The trend from pop culture and the convenience in accessing smoke adds up to the reasons why some people continues with this habit.I believe that there are solutions that can tackle and reduce smoking, beginning with medias should portray smoking to have consequences that are relatable. A movie I have seen showed the protagonist's constant need for cigarette throughout the show. However, in the end when he finally unites with his crush, he develops a severe disease, mainly from his smoking habits, in which he regretted in the end. This method of portraying people who smoke totally made my younger niece scared of smoking. In addition, government should control the accessibility of cigarettes. Policies that result and fewer stores being able to sell cigarettes and increasing tax pricing of smoke of any kind will definitely make smoking less convenient for many people.In conclusion, although many people knew how harmful smoking is, many people think it is cool to smoke and it is convenient and easy to buy. By making smoking less trendy in society and harder to access, I believe that smoking will be less attractive, hence reducing the number of smokers in society.;"In today's society, encountering someone who smokes is quite common. Despite the widespread understanding that smoking is harmful, we frequently witness individuals exhaling thick clouds of smoke. This behavior is partly driven by the perception that smoking is cool, along with the fact that cigarettes can be easily purchased in nearly every store. This essay delves into the factors that contribute to smoking and explores potential solutions to this issue.One significant factor is the societal belief that smoking is fashionable. Various aspects of pop culture, including songs, movies, and literature, often depict smoking in a positive light. For instance, a comedy I recently watched featured a character who smoked, presenting him as more appealing and giving him an aura of sophistication, while non-smoking characters appeared ordinary and less interesting. Additionally, the ease of access to cigarettes amplifies this problem; a recent study revealed that over 80% of individuals who started smoking did so because they could easily obtain cigarettes from local shops. The combination of cultural influences and the convenience of purchasing cigarettes contributes to the persistence of this habit among many.I believe there are effective strategies to combat and reduce smoking. Firstly, media representations should emphasize the negative consequences of smoking in relatable ways. For example, I watched a film where the main character's relentless craving for cigarettes ultimately led to severe health issues, regrettably affecting their relationship with their love interest. This portrayal successfully instilled fear of smoking in my younger niece. Additionally, the government should take action to limit the availability of cigarettes. Implementing policies that reduce the number of retailers permitted to sell cigarettes and increasing taxes on tobacco products would make smoking less convenient for the public.In conclusion, while many people recognize the dangers of smoking, the perception of smoking as 'cool' and its easy accessibility continue to attract new smokers. By reducing smoking's appeal in society and limiting access to cigarettes, I believe we can make smoking less attractive, thereby decreasing the number of smokers overall."
496;The diagram below show the development of the horse over a period of 40 million years. The evolution of the horse, with particular emphasis on the changing foot structure.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram illustrates the evolution of the horse in terms of their foot structure over a 40 million year period. Overall, the horse's were divided into four stages of development, starting from a period of 40 million years ago until now, with a 10 to 15 million year gap approximation in between.To begin with, 40 million years ago, the Eohippus, which was the first developmental stage of a horse's foot structure was similar to the bone structure of a human's hand. However, they branch out into five toes while travelling on foot. Then, during stage 2 of the horse's foot development, which was 10 million years later, the horse evolved into a Mesohippus. With regards to the structure of its toe, it was reduced from the original five into three. In addition, the middle toe had a larger foot structure compared to other other two.Next, 15 million years later, came the evolution of a Merychippus from a Mesohippus. Similarly, the foot structure was identical to the Mesohippus' horse but did not have the middle toe's length significantly longer than the other two. Although the middle toe was thicker than before, it became more even in terms of its length comparison to its other two toes. Finally, the emergence of the final evolution of the horse in modern days. With regards to the foot structure, it no longer branched out into several toes as it used to be, but is shaped like a tree branch with a rounded bases on the bottom of the foot.;The diagram depicts the evolution of the horse's foot structure over a span of 40 million years, divided into four developmental stages with approximately 10 to 15 million-year intervals between each phase.Starting 40 million years ago, the first stage features the Eohippus, which had a foot structure resembling the bone structure of a human hand but evolved to have five toes for mobility. Fast forward to the second stage, 10 million years later, the horse had transformed into the Mesohippus. In this stage, the number of toes decreased from five to three, with the middle toe becoming the largest among them.Subsequently, 15 million years later, the Merychippus evolved from the Mesohippus. Although the foot structure remained similar to that of the Mesohippus, the middle toe was no longer significantly longer than the others. However, it was thicker than before, resulting in a more uniform length among all three toes.Finally, in modern times, we see the last evolution of the horse. The foot structure has streamlined, losing its multiple toes and taking on a shape akin to a tree branch with a rounded base at the bottom.
700;The diagram below shows how Olive Oil is manufactured.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information below.;The Olive Oil is manufactured through several ways. First of all, the olives are picked from the trees by the farmers. Then the fresh olives are rinished using the cold water. The machines used are specific and it helps belt to smash the olives. After smashed, the olives become either olive paster or the olive stones. The next step is to put those into a bag with holes. Moving onto the next step, it will be pressed by a certain pressurer. It gives a great amount of weight on the olives so that it can be well pressed. Moreover it will be separated into either oil or water. Then, it will be stored and sold to the consumers. Thus, it is quite apparent that olive oil is manufactured by specific steps. And so more, olive oil is widely used as it is a good source for the chefs when cooking.;Olive oil is produced through a series of intricate steps. Initially, farmers harvest the olives from the trees. After collecting the fresh olives, they are rinsed with cold water. Special machines are then used to crush the olives, resulting in either olive paste or pits. The crushed olives are placed in a perforated bag and then subjected to a certain amount of pressure. This significant weight compresses the olives effectively, separating the oil from the water. Once extracted, the oil is stored and prepared for sale to consumers. It is evident that the production of olive oil involves precise processes, and it is widely valued by chefs for its culinary properties.

298;The diagram below shows how oil is expected in use of production of perfumeSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The given process chart illustrates how perfume is obtained using oil as an ingredient. Overall, the product undergoes 4 main steps, which involve prevalently water and the usage of heating and cooling down methods, in addition to a separation machine, before being ready to be used to create a fragrance.For starters, the water is placed in a metal tank and brought to the boiling point through direct flames. Then, the steam is conducted by a pipe to another cistern, where aromatic plants are added, in order to obtain oil vapor mixed with steam.Right afterward, the mixture goes into a pipe system, where a condensation process takes place, thanks to a condenser that uses cold water. In doing so, the cold water flowing in the condenser absorbs the heat that comes from the pipe where the oil and water solution is. After that, water mixed with essential oil reaches the last tank, in which a separator proceeds to take essential oil apart. This way, only the aromatic water is able to proceed and it is possible to use it in the perfume industry.;The process chart outlines the method of extracting perfume using oil as a primary ingredient. In summary, the procedure involves four key steps that primarily utilize water, along with heating and cooling techniques, as well as a separation machine, before the final product is ready for fragrance creation.Initially, water is placed in a metal tank and heated to its boiling point using direct flames. Subsequently, the steam is directed through a pipe into another container where aromatic plants are introduced, resulting in an oil vapor infused with steam.Next, this mixture passes through a piping system, where condensation occurs thanks to a condenser that incorporates cold water. The cold water circulating in the condenser absorbs the heat from the pipe containing the oil-water solution. Eventually, the blend of water and essential oil reaches the final tank, where a separator extracts the essential oil. This process ensures that only the aromatic water continues forward, making it suitable for use in the perfume industry.
38;The diagram below shows how rain water is collected and then treated to be used as drinking water in an Australian town. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;Information is presented in a diagram which depicts the main steps of rainwater treatment with the aim to produce drinking water in a particular town in Australia.Overall, it can be clearly seen that the process involves a number of complex stages starting from collecting rainwater, purification until getting the water as a final product.At the beginning of the process, rainwater is drained from a roof through a tube which is attached to each house. Then the water flow through the tube to a three-layer water filter which is the first step of water purification. After that, the filtered water is kept in a storage tank which is connected to a water treatment tank. As the water in the storage flows into the water treatment tank, it is mixed with chemicals, making this step as the final part of the process. Once the water is mixed, it flows from the water treatment tank to each house and is ready for drinking.;The information is illustrated in a diagram that outlines the key stages of rainwater treatment aimed at producing potable water for a specific town in Australia. Overall, the process involves several intricate steps, beginning with the collection of rainwater and culminating in the delivery of clean drinking water. Initially, rainwater is collected from the roof via a tube that is installed on each house. The collected water then flows through the tube into a three-layer water filter, marking the first stage of the purification process. After filtration, the water is stored in a tank that connects to a water treatment facility. As the water from the storage tank flows into the treatment tank, it is combined with chemicals, constituting the final phase of the process. Once treated, the water is channeled from the treatment tank to individual households, making it ready for consumption.
472;The diagram below shows how solar panels can be used to provide electricity for domestic use.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram illustrates the production of electricity for domestic use by solar panels. Overall, electricity is provided after it has been processed using 5 equipments ( solar panels, inverter electrical panel, utility meter and utility grid).First of all, solar panels on the roof of a normal house receive and absorb energy from the sun and turn it into DC current. The second stage is that, the DC current is converted into AC current by using inverter, which controls the electricity and production. After that, once the solar electricity has been distributed to our homes, it is then flowed back to the grid through a utility meter.At the final stage of the process, a utility grid, which looks like a small electrical tower, provides electricity when an user uses extra amount than the amount produced by the solar panles. By these stages, electricity is produced and ready for domestic use.;The diagram depicts the process of generating electricity for household use through solar panels. In summary, electricity is generated after passing through five components: solar panels, an inverter, an electrical panel, a utility meter, and the utility grid.Initially, solar panels installed on the roof of a typical home capture sunlight and convert it into direct current (DC) electricity. In the next phase, this DC electricity is transformed into alternating current (AC) by an inverter, which also manages the flow of electricity. Once the solar-generated electricity is utilized in the home, any surplus energy is sent back to the grid via a utility meter.In the final stage, the utility grid—represented by a small electrical tower—supplies electricity when the household's consumption exceeds the output from the solar panels. Through these steps, electricity is generated and made available for residential use.
1082;The diagram below shows the average hours of unpaid work per week done by people in different categories. (Unpaid work refers to such activities as childcare in the home, housework and gardening.)Describe the information presented below, comparing results for men and women in the categories shown. Suggest reasons for what you see.;"The bar graph provides information regarding the average hours of uncompensated work done weekly by men and women in marriage. The data are categorised by the number of children that they have.Overall, it is clearly observed that as the number of children increases, so is the average of unpaid working hours per week for married women. However, the time spent in these hours of their male counterparts are stable. It is also seen that the females have more hours of uncompensated labour than the males.In detail, those females with 3 or more children have worked 60 hours per week without pay, which is by far the highest average hour compared to the other categories. The amount of time they spent with this type of work diminishes as the number of children becomes fewer; married females with 1 to 2 children have 10 hours less and those without children have 30 hours weekly.In regard with the type of gender, married males have lesser average hours of unpaid jobs than married females. The maried men have only less than 20 hours per week spent on this job, which is apporoximately just a half of the time spent in women with children. Moreover, the time spent for married men did not alter in the different given categories.";"The bar graph illustrates the average weekly hours of unpaid work performed by married men and women, categorized by the number of children they have. Overall, it is evident that as the number of children increases, married women dedicate more time to unpaid work each week. In contrast, the time spent by their male counterparts remains consistent. Notably, women engage in significantly more hours of unpaid labor than men.Specifically, women with three or more children average 60 hours of unpaid work per week, the highest among all groups. As the number of children decreases, the hours dedicated to unpaid work also decline; married women with one to two children spend 10 hours less, while those without children contribute 30 hours each week.In terms of gender comparison, married men average fewer hours of unpaid work than married women, with men working less than 20 hours per week. This is approximately half the time that women with children invest in unpaid jobs. Furthermore, the hours dedicated by married men remain unchanged across the different categories."

586;The diagram below shows the development of cutting tools in the Stone Age. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The given map illustrates the changes of the village Chorleywood, located near London, whose population has grown since 1850.Overall, the structure of the village changed significantly from 1868 to 1994. It is clear that the village growth is particularly linked with the building of the motorway and the railway. The increased infrastructure shaped the layout of surrounded area.The village was situated on the main road and was comparatively small rom 1868 until 1883. However, from 1883 onwards, the village grew significantly on the southern side. This was due to the railway contstruction in 1909. The part around the Chorleyood Station got populated and stretched along the railroad until the 1970s.Another key factor of the development was the construction of the motorway in 1970. The motorway was build on the eastern side of the city and crossed the main road as well as the railway. This resulted in new developments around the newly built motorway on former unspoiled land, espescially the Chorleywood Park and Golf Course.;The provided map depicts the transformations of the village of Chorleywood, located near London, highlighting its population growth since 1850. In summary, the village's layout underwent considerable changes between 1868 and 1994, with its expansion closely tied to the construction of the motorway and railway. The enhanced infrastructure significantly altered the surrounding area's configuration. From 1868 to 1883, Chorleywood was situated along the main road and remained relatively small. However, beginning in 1883, the village experienced considerable expansion towards the south, largely attributed to the railway's construction in 1909. The area surrounding Chorleywood Station became populated and extended along the railway line through the 1970s.Another pivotal aspect of the village's development was the establishment of the motorway in 1970, which was built on the eastern side of the village, intersecting both the main road and the railway. This led to new developments emerging around the newly constructed motorway, particularly on previously untouched land, including areas such as Chorleywood Park and Golf Course.
1038;The diagram below shows the life cycle of a salmon, from egg to adult fish.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram depicts the life-cycle of the salmon, from being an egg to transforming into a fully grown adult fish.The first stage of the salmon starts in the river, where the spawning of two mature salmons lead to the laying of eggs. The rivers have long been chosen by salmons for breeding spots because their fresh-saltless water is suitable for the eggs and the freshly hatched baby salmons to start maturing in. After emerging from the eggs, the hatchlings stay on in the fresh water till they pre-mature/partially grow. After gaining considerable size and adapting to the primary waters, they travel to the estuaries, the only stop-over between them and the oceans. Only the first of the young salmons to reach the estuaries are able to make it to the oceans. This is because once these small and stagnant water bodies get over-crowded, there is virtually no space left in them which in-turn leads to the death of many young salmons.The young salmons who were able to survive the estuaries journey to the oceans, where the salty water increases their size and makes them fully grown. After getting the maturity to breed, they go back to the rivers from where the cycle starts all-over again.In total, there are 8 stages in the life of a salmon to maturity, it starts in the rivers and ends in the rivers too.;The diagram illustrates the life cycle of a salmon, beginning with its development from an egg and culminating in the emergence of a fully grown adult fish. The cycle commences in rivers, where the mating of two mature salmon results in the laying of eggs. Salmon select these freshwater locations for spawning, as the clean, salt-free water provides an ideal environment for the eggs and newly hatched fry to grow and develop. After the hatchlings emerge from their eggs, they remain in the freshwater until they reach a partially grown state. Once they have achieved a sufficient size and acclimated to their surroundings, they migrate to the estuaries, which serve as the only intermediate stop between their riverside origins and the ocean. Only the first young salmon to arrive at the estuaries can successfully progress to the ocean, as overcrowding in these small, calm waters can lead to a lack of space and ultimately the demise of many young salmon.Those young salmon that manage to survive the estuarine phase then journey to the ocean, where the saline waters help them grow to maturity. Once they are ready to breed, they return to the rivers, completing the cycle that began with their birth.In total, the life cycle of a salmon consists of eight stages, commencing in rivers and returning there as adults.
458;The diagram below shows the life cycle of the honey bee.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;Overall the cycle of life of the honey bee can be divided in 6 steps which can be grouped in 2 main stages: hatching and reaching for maturity. This process lasts around 34 to 36 days and it repeats itself over again.The cycle starts when female bees lay their eggs. They lay their eggs rapidly but surely at around 1 or 2 eggs every 3 days. Subsequently the hatching of the eggs happens after 9 to 10 days.Afterwards the nymph molts begin to come out of the eggs and keep on gradually growing up until the 7th day of the cycle. During their 9th day, the bees grow 3 times their initial size. Following this, the young adult emerges. The final step occurs after 4 days when the bee reaches its maturity and females are ready to lay eggs again. Making the cycle begin again from the laying of the eggs.;The life cycle of the honeybee can be divided into six stages, which are grouped into two main phases: hatching and maturation. This entire process takes approximately 34 to 36 days and repeats itself continuously. It begins when female bees lay eggs, doing so steadily at a rate of about one or two eggs every three days. The eggs hatch after about 9 to 10 days. Once they hatch, the nymphs emerge and continue to grow throughout the first week. By day 9, the bees have increased to three times their original size. Following this growth spurt, young adults emerge. Four days later, the bees reach maturity, and the females are ready to lay eggs once again, restarting the cycle.

There is a total of seven steps where the initial step is to pick some olives, and the final step is to extract only olive oil from pressed olive paste.To put into detail, obtaining enough amounts of olive is the starting process. Picked olives are rinsed in cold water. After that, rinsed olives are delivered into a smashing machine through belts. This machine enables olives to divide into olive paste and olive stones. Thereafter, only olive paste is put into hollow bags and carried into the pressing process. Olive paste inside the bag is pressed and further move into separating process. A portion of olive oil is completely removed from the rest of water portion. Finally, extracted olive oil is delivered to storages and on the market if necessarily. This is the complete process of olive oil production.;This illustration outlines the entire procedure for producing olive oil from olives, consisting of seven distinct steps. The process begins with the harvesting of olives and concludes with the extraction of olive oil from the pressed olive paste.To elaborate, the initial step involves gathering a sufficient quantity of olives. Once harvested, the olives are washed in cold water. Next, the rinsed olives are fed into a crushing machine via conveyor belts, which separates them into olive paste and pits. The olive paste is then placed into hollow bags and transferred to the pressing stage. In this stage, the paste is pressed to extract olive oil, which is then separated from the remaining water content. Finally, the extracted olive oil is stored and made available on the market as needed. This outlines the complete process of olive oil production.

606;The diagram below shows the structure of solar panels and its use.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagrams illustrate the construction of a simple solar panel and how it works to heat air or water while passing through the inner chamber of the equipment. Although more complex and modern solar panels are available in today’s world, a solar panel simply consists of three main parts, a box-shaped basement, transparent glass, the entry, the exit of the inner tube. Naturally, sunray as an energy source is essential to use the heating system.Considering the function of solar panel, transparent glass which is in optimal thickness act as a receiver of heat from the sun, that eventually transfer to air or water. A similar principle works for both substances. While the substance to be heated moves through the cylinder, heat energy is convected that provides heated material which can be used for different purposes such as household or commercial needs. Finally, a heated substance is pumped into pipes which are mounted to the outlet of the panel.;The diagrams depict the construction and functionality of a basic solar panel, which is designed to heat air or water as it flows through the inner chamber of the device. While more sophisticated and advanced solar panels are available today, a traditional solar panel consists of three main components: a box-shaped base, a layer of transparent glass, and the inlets and outlets for the inner tube. Sunlight serves as the essential energy source for this heating system.In terms of functionality, the transparent glass—which is of optimal thickness—acts as a heat receiver that captures sunlight and transfers the heat to the air or water. This principle operates similarly for both substances. As the material passes through the cylinder, heat energy is transferred through convection, resulting in heated air or water that can be utilized for various applications, including residential or commercial use. Ultimately, the heated substance is then pumped into pipes connected to the panel's outlet.

126;The diagram shows the components of a neuron and how it worksWrite a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram below identifies the role of each neuronal components and illustrates the message transmission process happening in a neuron.The main component of a neuron is the cell body or soma. From its core branches out many small nerves called dendrites with the role of receving messages from other cells. The acquired messages are passed away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles or glands through a chain of axon. Each axon is coverred by a small element called myelin sheath that helps speed up the neural impulses.The message transmission process is conducted by continous actions of each component. After the dendrites receive information, the cell body will trigger an electrical signal traveling down the axon chain carrying these messages to a destination consisting of a network off terminal buttons. Each button form junction with other dendrite other cells to connect the messages. After all, all neuron are connected to form a network.;The diagram below outlines the functions of various neuronal components and demonstrates how messages are transmitted within a neuron. At the center of a neuron lies the cell body, also known as the soma. Extending from the soma are numerous small extensions called dendrites, which are responsible for receiving messages from other cells. These incoming messages are then relayed away from the cell body through a series of axons to other neurons, muscles, or glands. Each axon is insulated by a structure known as the myelin sheath, which enhances the speed of neural impulses.The message transmission process relies on the continuous activity of each component. Once the dendrites gather information, the cell body initiates an electrical signal that travels along the axon, carrying messages to their destination, which comprises a network of terminal buttons. Each button forms junctions with the dendrites of other cells, facilitating the connection of messages. Ultimately, all neurons are interconnected to create a complex network.

After that, we let them dry in a sufficient temperature outside so that we can spin them.After we finish the spinning process, we break them into two productions which are wool and string. The string production can be recycled while the wool can be made into tufts of wool and put them in the tuft of storage.The balls of yarn comes from the tuft storage which later are the things that we are knitting. The balls of yarn are also the main source to make woolen goods such carpets and jackets which are usually we use in a daily life.;The diagram below illustrates the various steps involved in the production of woolen goods. In general, the process can be divided into two main stages: the first stage involves producing wool, while the second stage focuses on creating yarn. To obtain wool and yarn, we start with shearing the sheep, followed by cleaning the fleece. Once cleaned, we allow the wool to dry outdoors at an appropriate temperature, which is necessary for the spinning process. Upon completing the spinning, we separate the output into two categories: wool and yarn. The yarn produced can be recycled, while the wool is processed into tufts and stored in a tuft storage area. The balls of yarn are sourced from the tuft storage, and these are used for knitting. Additionally, the yarn serves as the primary material for crafting woolen goods such as carpets and jackets, which are commonly used in everyday life.

On the contrary, the products that pass the inspection process will be packaged and then sent to relevant users.To draw a conclusion, the production of circuit boards consists of a few stages, such as cutting and spraying, IC attachment and soldering, quality supervision, etc.;The flow chart illustrates the production process of circuit boards. In summary, the chart outlines a multi-step procedure that begins with the delivery of raw materials and concludes with the shipment of finished products to factories. Initially, raw materials are received by circuit board manufacturers, where they are cut, treated with fire retardant, and cleaned. Next, the process continues with automatic IC attachment and soldering. Once these tasks are completed, products go through two stages of quality control, which include visual inspections and quality testing. If any substandard products are identified during these inspections, the chips from those items will be discarded. Conversely, products that successfully pass all quality assessments will be packaged and dispatched to their respective users. In conclusion, the circuit board production process involves multiple stages, including cutting and spraying, IC attachment and soldering, and quality control.
794;The diagram shows the production of hydroelectricitySummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram displays the general principles of how electricity is generated in a dam. In general, to produce hydroenergy, there should be a difference in the level of water flowing through the turbine.The water is stored in the reservoir out of which it goes through the intake to the penstrock. The pens should be inclined. This means that its high point is in the intake and then it goes down to the turbine. The pressure, that the flow creates, makes the turbin roll and start the generator. Generator produces power that is supplied to the long distance power lines.Having passed throuth the turbine, water, in its turn, sharply goes down and falls into the river.As it can be seen from the diagram, the generator and long distance power lines are located on the ground while there parts of the dam, such as the intake, the penstock, and the turbine are all under the ground.;The diagram illustrates the fundamental principles of electricity generation in a dam. To produce hydroenergy, there needs to be a difference in water levels flowing through the turbine.Water is stored in a reservoir and flows through the intake to the penstock, which should be oriented at an incline. This configuration allows water to enter from the higher point at the intake and descend towards the turbine. The pressure generated by this flow causes the turbine to spin, activating the generator. The generator then produces electricity, which is transmitted via long-distance power lines.After passing through the turbine, the water drops significantly and returns to the river. As depicted in the diagram, the generator and power lines are situated above ground, while components of the dam, including the intake, penstock, and turbine, are located underground.
768;The diagram shows the relationship between a numbers of different languages. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;This diagram illustrates the connection between different types of English language.Overall, English has two big branches - American English and British english, that divide further in to subbranches. Furthermore, British english has more subbranches tan American english.In terms of American English, it divides into two main subbranches - USA and Canada. Canada further divides into two types of language - Angelophone and Francophone Canadian. Whereas, USA branch divides in to six types of languages, such as Philipines, American Samoa, West coast, Mid west, North-east coast and Puertorico.British English has three times more subbranches than American english branch. One of the subbraches is West indies, that divides into Jamaican and Barbados. Similarly, Far east and Australian subbranches also divides into two subbranches (Malay and chinese, and Australian and Newzealand respectively). West african, Angelophones and East African are three languages that belong to the African Subbranch. Last two subbranches - Indian pakistan and British Isles each divide into four types of languages, British Isles into Irish, English, Welsh and Scotish, and Indian Pakistan into four different forms of indian english.;This diagram depicts the various connections within the English language. Broadly, English is divided into two major branches: American English and British English, each of which further breaks down into subbranches. Notably, British English features more subbranches than American English. In American English, there are two primary subbranches: the USA and Canada. The Canadian branch splits into two types of language: Anglophone and Francophone Canadian. In contrast, the USA branch encompasses six distinct varieties, namely those spoken in the Philippines, American Samoa, the West Coast, the Midwest, the Northeast, and Puerto Rico.British English has three times as many subbranches as American English. One prominent subbranch is the West Indies, which further divides into Jamaican and Barbadian dialects. Likewise, the Far East and Australian branches each split into two subbranches, comprising Malay and Chinese for the Far East, and Australian and New Zealand English for the Australasian subbranch. The African subbranch includes three dialects: West African, Anglophone African, and East African. The last two subbranches—Indian English and the British Isles—each have four distinct varieties. The British Isles subbranch consists of Irish, English, Welsh, and Scottish, while the Indian subbranch consists of four forms of Indian English.
192;The diagrams below show how houses can be protected in areas which are prone to flooding.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The schemes compare two different methods of defence for homes that can be easily affected by floods. Overall, they show flood protection with and without a stopbank, while the at-risk home is raised higher above ground level in two pictures.The first diagram depicts how a stopbank acts as a natural barrier to prevent river water from flooding. The stopbank is a small mound of land next to the river that is higher than the 100-year-flood level and prevents the drain from overwhelming its banks. Nearby buildings can be built on stilts to prevent flooding from rainwater as well as the water passing through the floodgate beneath the stopbank, resulting in an area of ‘internal ponding.’If it had not been a stopbank, as described in the second diagram, there would have been nothing to stop the river from flooding. In this case, the solution is to put homes on stilts much higher than the one in the first picture. The height of the stilts is measured to ensure that the floor of the house is three hundred meters above the 100-year-flood level regardless of how deep the water area is under the house. This measure is called the ‘freeboard.’;The diagrams illustrate two distinct home defense strategies against flooding. They highlight flood protection options both with and without a stopbank, while also indicating that the at-risk home is raised to a greater height in two of the images.The first diagram shows how a stopbank serves as a natural barrier to stop river water from flooding surrounding areas. A stopbank consists of a small elevated mound of earth adjacent to the river, positioned above the 100-year flood level, which helps prevent the drainage system from being overwhelmed. Homes in close proximity to the river can be built on stilts, protecting them from rainwater flooding and water that could enter through the floodgate under the stopbank, which may cause ‘internal ponding.’In contrast, the second diagram illustrates a scenario without a stopbank, where there is no barrier to prevent river flooding. Here, the solution involves constructing homes on stilts that are significantly taller than those in the first diagram. The stilts must be elevated to ensure that the house floor is placed three hundred meters above the 100-year flood level, regardless of how deep the water may accumulate underneath. This clearance is referred to as ‘freeboard.’
966;The diagrams below show the design for a wave-energy machine and its location.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;first of all, the picture show (A Wave- energy machine) we can see that there is electricity generator its the machine that take the energy from the waves and it contain two turbines so the air could flow throuh it and from what it shown we can notice that there is two of wave energy machin: the large waves and the small waves.Secondly,the small wavs had low output since its for the small waves, in addition it also had low installation costs because its smaller.in the other hand the large waves had high output and high installation costs since its also large.To sum up we can say that the air flow to the turbine so the turbine could move and got the electrisity , there is also air come from the water levels which hepls the machine get the elecricity that it needs so the people could use it like a solar power.;First of all, the image depicts a wave energy machine equipped with an electricity generator that harnesses energy from ocean waves. This machine features two turbines that allow air to flow through it. Notably, there are two types of wave energy machines shown: one designed for large waves and another for small waves.Secondly, the machine designed for small waves produces lower energy output because it is optimized for smaller wave movements. However, it also comes with lower installation costs due to its smaller size. In contrast, the machine for large waves generates higher energy output but also incurs higher installation costs because of its larger scale.In summary, air flows through the turbines, causing them to rotate and generate electricity. Additionally, air is drawn in from varying water levels, which aids the machine in producing the electricity needed for public use, similar to how solar power operates.
916;The diagrams below show the development of the horse over a period of 40 million years.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant;The diagram depicts the different stages of the body habitus and the relative changes in foot structures that under went in the process of evolution of the modern horse, since 40 million years ago.The modern horse had gone through 3 main stages in order to become it's current version, each stage shows distinctive changes in the body as a whole.Having said that, the earliest species that existed is namely Echippus, then it was mesohippus and finally it was Merychippus.The Echippus is the identified first ancestor of the modern horse that existed 40 million years ago. They appeared relatively similar to the size of a sheep and their foot apearently had four toes.However, Mesohippus was the second in line of the modern horses and was relatively bigger and taller, the foot structure got limited to three toes and the middle toe being the widerest.15 million years after the existance of mesohippus, merychippus emerged, they were similar in both the size and shape of our modern horses, but as far as the foot is concerned the middle toe became more prominent and the rest two toes started to shrink. Finally, the modern horses look twice the size of Echippus and their feet looked proper coronet.;The diagram illustrates the various stages of body structure and the corresponding changes in foot anatomy that occurred during the evolution of the modern horse over the past 40 million years. The evolution of the modern horse can be characterized by three key stages, with each phase displaying distinct alterations in overall body form. The earliest known ancestor is the Echippus, followed by the Mesohippus, and finally the Merychippus. Echippus, the first recognized ancestor of the modern horse, existed 40 million years ago and was roughly the size of a sheep, with a foot structure that featured four toes. The Mesohippus, arising next, was larger and taller than its predecessor, with its foot structure reduced to three toes, the middle of which was the most prominent. Approximately 15 million years after Mesohippus, the Merychippus appeared. This species resembled modern horses in both size and shape, but its foot structure showed further evolution: the middle toe became more dominant while the other two toes diminished. In contrast, modern horses are about twice the size of the Echippus, with feet more distinctly shaped and developed.
528;The diagrams below show the existing ground floor plan of a house and a proposed plan for some building work.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The information below shows the present floor plan and changes been suggested. Generally spekaing, there is no big difference, kitchen will stay as a kitchen and living room will stay as a living room.At the moment the living room space is smaller than in proposed new plan. The living room space suggested to be increased as internal wall will be demolited. Moreover, in suggested plan there is no place for storage under the stairs as stairs will be changed in their shape and also there will be no more hall place will be integrated into living room.The door intro kitchen will be switched from single one to double and will be located near the entrance door. The kitchen furniture suggested to be located on the opposite side to the wall and doubled indoor door. However, some things stays the same in both plans. For example, the location of both entrance doors - front and backyard and also wall between hall and kitchen.;The information below presents the current floor plan alongside the proposed modifications. Overall, the layout remains largely unchanged, with the kitchen continuing to serve its original purpose and the living room retaining its function.Currently, the living room is smaller compared to the proposed plan, which suggests expanding the space by removing an internal wall. In addition, the new design does not allocate any storage beneath the stairs, as the stairs' shape will be altered. Furthermore, the hall area will be incorporated into the living room, eliminating a separate space.The kitchen entrance will transition from a single door to a double door, positioned closer to the main entrance. The proposed kitchen layout suggests placing the furniture on the opposite wall, across from the double doors. However, several elements remain unchanged between both plans, including the positions of the front and back entrance doors and the wall separating the hall from the kitchen.
784;The diagrams below show the water supply system in Australia present and in future.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The given diagram illustrates the processes involved in the water supply system in Australia at the present and in the future.To begin, the first kind of water is located in the dam and storage where the waste water is lead to a water treatment plant. Meanwhile, from the storage come out pure water and provide potable water to households, factories, shops, and all the city. At the same time, the wastewater produced in the city is transferred to a water treatment plant as well.The last type of water is the storm water that is sent to the river from the city.Overall, it can be seen that the process has three types of waters in the process of water supply which are pure, storm, and waste water. depending on the type of water, these can be found in the dam and storage, water treatment plant, river and in different places of the city such as households, factories, shops, among others.;The provided diagram depicts the current and future processes of the water supply system in Australia. Initially, water is sourced from the dam and storage facilities, where wastewater is directed to a water treatment plant. Concurrently, the stored water is processed into clean, potable water that is distributed to households, factories, shops, and the entire city. Simultaneously, the wastewater generated within the city is also sent to the water treatment plant.Additionally, stormwater collected from the city flows into the river. In summary, the water supply process incorporates three types of water: clean, storm, and wastewater. These types can be found in various locations, including the dam and storage, water treatment plant, river, and throughout the city in places such as households, factories, and shops.
136;The diagrams show the structure of solar panel and its use.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram illustrates how a solar panel is constructed, and the complex process of how the renewable energy source provides heated water and air to households.The first diagram shows us visual information about the basic structure of the solar panel. It´s construction is mainly a large box with two pipes placed on both sides. Then, one equally large top which is transparent is placed on top of the container.According to the second diagram, the solar panel is designed to provide the home with warm air. Firstly, cold air is allowed in through the inlet and let inside the box. Secondly, the transparent top allows sunrays to transform the cool air to warm air by their heating properties. After that, the warm air goes through and out the outlet.In regards to the third diagram, we can clearly see that the construction is similar with the exception that water pipes are added in the main box, in order to supply households with hot water. In comparison with the second diagram, where air was driven through the pipes, water is the main resource here. After the water has entered the inlet, water passes through the pipes and out;The diagram depicts the construction of a solar panel and the intricate process through which this renewable energy source provides heated water and air to homes.The first illustration provides a visual overview of the solar panel's fundamental structure. It consists mainly of a large box with two pipes positioned on either side, topped with a similarly large transparent cover.The second diagram explains how the solar panel generates warm air for residential spaces. Initially, cold air enters through an inlet and is directed into the box. Next, the transparent top allows sunlight to warm the incoming cool air, utilizing its heat properties. Subsequently, the warmed air is expelled through an outlet.In the third diagram, we observe a similar construction, but it includes water pipes within the main box to deliver hot water to households. Unlike the second diagram, which focused on air circulation through the pipes, this design uses water as the primary medium. After entering through the inlet, the water passes through the pipes and is eventually released.
1360;The education system is the only critical factor in the development of a country, agree/disagree (from Target Band ;This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskSome people say that the education system is the only critical factor in the development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Write at least 250 wordsEducation plays an imperative role in the overall progression of a country. Many people may heavily rely on quality education as preparation for real life employment and experiences. However, there are other factors that are needed to propel a country towards success.We must acknowledge the way the education system of a country prepares most individuals by equipping them with various skills. Prior to gaining a qualification to practice certain professions such as teaching, nursing or accounting, it is necessary for the individuals to undergo rigorous training. Certificate and diploma programs as well as university degrees are good examples of that. Some graduates may even choose to pursue further studies to attain certain requirements to be able to practice their chosen profession.The education system is undoubtedly important in preparing individuals to take on roles leading to the development of a country. However, it seems that producing graduates alone isn’t a guarantee of the advancement of a country. There are other factors that should come into play, and motivation of individuals is one. Without motivation, people may lose track of what they intend to do to contribute to the improvement of a country. drives people to achieve and maximize their potentials, because they are determined to get better at many aspects of their life, eventually yielding improvement for their entire country.Furthermore, the availability of natural resources and job opportunities may also affect the growth of a national economy. Innovations of many individuals require raw materials, and should the country be able to mine these, their production and perhaps even export may help in stabilizing the local market. Finally, it is also important that the availability of employment is aligned with the skills of individuals applying for the positions. Giving skilled people the opportunity to apply their knowledge and experience in their profession makes them more productive, which contributes to GDP growth.In conclusion, education continues to play a pivotal role in the development of a country. However, other important factors should play a role in order to achieve steady and continuous progress.This response adequately addresses the task prompt. The writer’s viewpoint is clear throughout the essay. Each paragraph has its role and they are used effectively to organise ideas and information. The coherence and advanced vocabulary help the writer to create an impression of a skilled, fluent English user. Good control of grammar and punctuation is evident. This essay could achieve Band 8 in IELTS.;"This essay is derived from a topic featured in the ""Target Band 7"" book (page 54, used with permission). You should allocate approximately 40 minutes for this task. Some argue that the education system is the sole critical factor in a nation's development. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this assertion? Write a minimum of 250 words. Education plays a crucial role in the overall advancement of a nation. Many individuals rely on high-quality education to prepare for employment and navigate real-life experiences. Nevertheless, there are other factors essential for a country's success. It is important to recognize how a nation's education system equips individuals with various skills. Before qualifying for certain professions, such as teaching, nursing, or accounting, individuals must undergo extensive training. Examples of this include certificate programs, diplomas, and university degrees. Some graduates may even pursue further studies to meet specific requirements for their chosen fields. While the education system is undeniably significant in preparing individuals for roles that contribute to national development, simply producing graduates does not ensure a country's progress. Motivation is another critical factor. Without it, individuals may struggle to remain focused on their goals and contributions to national improvement. Motivation drives individuals to realize and enhance their potential, ultimately benefiting their entire country. Moreover, the availability of natural resources and job opportunities also influences economic growth. Innovations by individuals often require raw materials; if a country can effectively extract these resources, it can boost production and potentially stabilize the local market through export. Lastly, aligning available employment with individuals’ skill sets is essential. By providing skilled individuals the chance to apply their knowledge and expertise in the workforce, productivity rises, thus contributing to GDP growth. In summary, while education plays a vital role in a nation's development, other significant factors must also be considered to achieve steady and ongoing progress. This response effectively addresses the prompt. The writer's perspective remains clear throughout the essay, with each paragraph serving a distinct purpose and contributing to the organization of ideas and information. The coherence and sophisticated vocabulary suggest the writer's proficiency in English. There is evident control over grammar and punctuation, indicating a potentially high IELTS Band score, possibly an 8."
1291;The end of the world’s fossil fuel resources and the subsequent changes will be a positive development in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Today’s society overwhelmingly depends on products made from fossil fuels. Most people would initially think about fuel for transport, but of course, fossil fuels are part of most of the fabric of life around us, from the plastics on our furniture to the pavements that we walk on. Changing our reliance on these resources can have various consequences; however, I believe that overall the society will benefit from finding viable alternatives for them.Depending on whether eco-friendly alternatives are developed, the positive effect on transport and the reduction of the associated pollution will be significant. Exhaust fumes from motor vehicles, planes and ships decrease air quality and contribute to global warming and the greenhouse effect. People’s health and the health of the planet will surely improve without these industries relying on fossil fuels. It could be that a type of transport crisis could develop as a result if society can no longer provide the power to transport so many individuals to where they want to go. This, however, does not have to be a bad thing, as it could force society to use alternative solutions, such as transport sharing and public transport development. The change in mind set has already begun. Some countries have already committed to having fossil fuel free transport and more cities are banning private vehicles from the centre of cities.Another positive development would be that more time and money would have to be put into developing renewable sources of energy, such as wind power, solar power, hydropower and tidal power. Technologies would improve and be more efficient and again, the world would use fewer sources of energy that cause pollution. This development can also be seen today, with many governments committing to proportions of their power needs coming from renewable resources.I, therefore, strongly agree with the statement that the changes from reducing reliance on fossil fuels will be positive. The only caveat is that society will need to have developed alternative sources of power rather soon, in order to avoid an energy crisis.";"Modern society is heavily reliant on products derived from fossil fuels. While many people often think first of fuel for transportation, fossil fuels are embedded in nearly every aspect of our daily lives—from the plastics used in our furniture to the pavement under our feet. Transitioning away from these resources can lead to various consequences; however, I believe that, overall, society stands to gain from finding viable alternatives. The impact on transportation could be particularly significant, especially if eco-friendly alternatives are successfully developed, leading to reduced pollution levels. Emissions from vehicles, airplanes, and ships degrade air quality and exacerbate global warming and the greenhouse effect. A shift away from fossil fuel dependence would likely improve both public health and the health of our planet. That said, there is a possibility of a transportation crisis emerging if society can no longer support the energy needs necessary for mass transit. Yet, this could also pave the way for alternative solutions, such as ridesharing initiatives and enhanced public transportation systems. A shift in mindset is already underway; several countries have pledged to eliminate fossil fuel-powered transport, and more cities are starting to restrict private vehicle access in their urban centers.Another beneficial shift would entail increased investment in developing renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydropower, and tidal energy. As technology improves and becomes more efficient, we will increasingly turn away from polluting energy sources. This trend is already visible, with numerous governments committing to a significant share of their energy needs coming from renewable sources.Consequently, I strongly believe that reducing our reliance on fossil fuels will generate positive outcomes. The key condition, however, is that society must swiftly develop alternative energy sources to avoid an impending energy crisis."
1307;The fact that enormous sums are paid for pieces of art is not acceptable at a time when many people around the world live in poverty. Discuss this statement and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is true that pieces of art in today’s world can change hands for enormous sums. Works by artists such as Picasso, da Vinci and Rembrandt have been sold for millions of dollars. Recently, a Modigliani was sold to a billionaire for one hundred and seventy million dollars. It certainly seems obscene that such figures are spent when many people around the world live in poverty.The work of many charities would be transformed by the money generated by just one of these art sales and in turn, the lives of ordinary people in need would be transformed. Medicines, food and shelter amongst other things could easily be provided, saving lots of lives, many of which would be children. When the issue is looked at from this point of view, the art sales world certainly seems obscene.However, in my opinion, things are unlikely to change. Human greed is endemic and people who have the drive to earn that amount of money and who actually have access to these sums in cash are not often people who will part with their wealth. Lots of prosperous people support many charities, but it is unlikely that they would completely relinquish their access to the luxuries that accompany their lives. The works of art are also often seen as investments in themselves, to be held on to for a period of time and then resold at a profit.In conclusion, in an ideal world, the vast sums of money that are spent on fine and rare works of art would be better spent on helping those in need. In reality, however, this is unlikely to take place.;It is undeniable that artworks today can fetch staggering prices. Masterpieces by renowned artists like Picasso, da Vinci, and Rembrandt have been auctioned for millions. Recently, a Modigliani piece was acquired by a billionaire for an astonishing one hundred seventy million dollars. Such extravagant spending certainly seems excessive, especially when so many people around the globe live in poverty. The funds generated from a single art sale could profoundly impact charitable organizations, significantly improving the lives of countless individuals in need. Essential resources like medicine, food, and shelter could be provided, potentially saving many lives, including those of vulnerable children. Viewed from this angle, the art market does appear rather extravagant.However, I believe that real change is unlikely. Human greed is widespread, and those capable of amassing such wealth are often not inclined to part with it easily. While many affluent individuals contribute to charitable causes, it is improbable that they would fully give up the luxuries that come with their status. Additionally, artworks are frequently regarded as investments, held for a time before being sold for profit.In summary, in a perfect world, the substantial sums spent on exquisite and rare artworks would be redirected towards aiding those in need. Unfortunately, this scenario is seldom realized in practice.

Overall, the first graph highlights a significant rise in the average monthly expenditure on children's sports, which surged from £20 in 2008 to nearly £33 in 2014. In contrast, the second graph reveals that football consistently remained the most popular sport among children, with participation increasing from approximately 7.9 million in 2008 to around 8 million. Regarding the other sports, swimming showed a modest growth trend, while athletics initially lagged in popularity until 2010 when it experienced a notable increase in participation. However, after reaching a peak in 2012, participation in athletics declined, diverging from the pattern seen in swimming.
52;The first chart below shows the percentages of women and men in a country involved in some kinds of home tasks (cooking, cleaning, pet caring and repairing the house. The second chart shows the amount of time each gender spent on each task per day.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The two given charts illustrates the houshold work done by male and female of a nation. where firstly, the amount of work done by men and women is measured in percentage, and secondly, the average time devoted to do perform those work is calculated in minutes.Overall, it can be clearly seen that women performed more tasks in both the given terms then men, Although, men performed House repairs more than women.Firstly, women performed more household work than men, their main interest was in cooking and cleaning, where 80% of women performed Cooking and 60 percent cleaning, where men were 20% less in both the tasks. However, Tasks like pet care and house repairs male were higher in percentage then female.Secondly, Ladies performed the mentioned tasks more than men in regards of cooking they spent about 1 hour and 20 min and in cleaning approximately 68 minutes. However, they were equal in pet care, Although men spend close to 20 min minutes in house repair on average basis.;The two provided charts illustrate household work carried out by men and women in a particular nation. The first chart measures the percentage of work done by each gender, while the second calculates the average time spent on these tasks in minutes. Overall, it is evident that women undertake more household responsibilities than men in both categories, although men engage more in home repairs. In detail, women contributed significantly more to household chores, primarily in cooking and cleaning, with 80% of women involved in cooking and 60% in cleaning. Men's participation in both tasks was approximately 20% lower. However, men had a higher percentage of involvement in pet care and home repairs compared to women.Regarding the time spent on these tasks, women devoted about 1 hour and 20 minutes to cooking and approximately 68 minutes to cleaning. In pet care, their time spent was similar to that of men. In contrast, men averaged nearly 20 minutes on home repairs.
1188;The first chart below shows the results of a survey which sampled a cross-section of 100,000 people asking if they traveled abroad and why they traveled for the period 1994-98.The second chart shows their destinations over the same period.;The first chart indicates the results of a survey of people in the UK who traveled abroad and the reasons why they traveled from 1994 and 1998. In addition, there is another chart which areas they visited. Overall, it can be seen the main reason the UK residents visited abroad is for holiday, and the total number of people who traveled steadily increased every year, except for 1995. In addition, they visited Western Europe extraordinarily much higher than north America, and other areas.Initially, the total number of abroad visiter started at 22,072 in 1994. Somehow the total number decreased in 1995. It was specificalltry 21,610, but the number soared to 24,949 and reached a peak of 28,828 in 1996 and 1998 respectively. To break down the detail, the main purpose is for holidays. It is apparently much higher than other reasons and its percentage tend to be almost two-thirds every year. Aside from holidays, two reasons follow the second reason for business, the third reason for visits to friends and relatives. It is not so significant changes in percentage.Interestingly, , they almost visited western Europe from 1994 to 1998. The proportion of visitors is much higher than in north America and other areas.It seems to be around 90 percent of visitors went to western Europe.The proportion of visiter can be seen slightly increased, however, there is no significant change.;The first chart presents the findings of a survey concerning UK residents who traveled abroad between 1994 and 1998, detailing their reasons for traveling. Additionally, there is another chart illustrating the regions they visited. Overall, it is evident that the primary motive for UK travelers going abroad was holidays, and the total number of travelers showed a consistent increase each year, with the exception of 1995. Furthermore, travelers predominantly chose to visit Western Europe, which was significantly more popular than North America and other regions.In 1994, the total number of international travelers was 22,072. However, this figure dropped to 21,610 in 1995. Following this decline, the number surged to 24,949, eventually peaking at 28,828 in both 1996 and 1998. Analyzing the reasons for travel, holidays were the leading motivation, consistently accounting for nearly two-thirds of all trips each year. The next two most common reasons were business and visits to friends and relatives, both of which showed little variation in percentage.Interestingly, from 1994 to 1998, the majority of travelers opted for Western Europe as their destination, with the proportion of visitors to this region far surpassing those traveling to North America and other parts of the world. Approximately 90 percent of travelers visited Western Europe during this period. Although there was a slight increase in the overall number of visitors, this change was not significant.

714;The flow chart illustrates the consequence of deforestation. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features.You should write at least 150 words.;"The supplied illustration outlines the problems of cutting forests. As we can see, there are 4 main branches and each of them describes a certain issue, caused by deforestation.According to the first branch from the left, forest destruction can lead to the state when soil becomes hard and ""baked"". It occurs due to the fact that heavy logging equipment compresses the soil, as the first block of the chart says. Because soil becomes ""baked"", rain water starts to run off which causes flooding.If we look at the remaining branches, we can see that they all lead to the same conclusion - less biodiversity. But there are three different reasons for it. The first one is soil erosion. When we cut the trees, we have fewer tree roots to support the topsoil that eventually erodes.The second reason - increased risk of burning. It is followed by the destruction of waste wood. Then we have some micro-organisms such as pioneer species that move in and initiate degradation of vegetation. And it's all resulted in less biodiversity.The last branch starts with the fact that after cutting forests we have less plants to give back moisture to air, so less moisture enters the air. This triggers less precipitation, and so, increased droughts. Plants that unable to withstand hot and dry weather die and it ends with less biodiversity.To conclude everything, the main purpose of the presented flow chart was to demonstrate the severe damage that could be caused by deforestation.";"The provided illustration highlights the issues associated with deforestation. It features four main branches, each addressing a specific problem arising from the loss of forests.The first branch, located on the left, points out that forest destruction can lead to soil becoming compacted and ""baked."" This occurs because heavy logging machinery compresses the soil, as indicated in the initial section of the chart. When soil hardens, rainwater cannot penetrate effectively, leading to runoff and increased flooding.Examining the other branches reveals that they all converge on a common outcome: a decrease in biodiversity. However, there are three distinct factors contributing to this decline. First is soil erosion; with fewer trees to anchor the topsoil, it becomes more susceptible to erosion when trees are removed.The second factor is an elevated risk of wildfires, exacerbated by the accumulation of debris and waste wood left behind after logging. This is coupled with the arrival of micro-organisms, including pioneer species, that can initiate vegetation degradation. All these factors collectively result in reduced biodiversity.The final branch addresses the reduced moisture in the air following deforestation. With fewer plants to release moisture, there is a decrease in precipitation, leading to more frequent droughts. Consequently, plants that cannot survive the increased heat and dryness perish, further diminishing biodiversity.In summary, the primary aim of the illustrated flow chart is to convey the extensive damage caused by deforestation."

Likewise, Canberra has lower temperatures than Brisbane during the whole year. In addition, Brisbane has a higher average number of days with rainfall than Canberra during most of the year.To start with, Canberra's maximum average daily temperatures have a significant decrease in tendency, from 27 degrees in January to only 11 degrees in July. In contrast, Brisbane's daily maximum temperatures present lower fluctuations from 28 degrees in January to just 21 degrees in July. Additionally, Brisbane reaches its highest maximum average daily temperature in February at 30 degrees, whilst Canberra reaches its lowest minimum average daily temperature in June and July at 2 degrees. Furthermore, the average number of days with rainfall decreases moderately during the winter season in Brisbane, from 14 days in February to 7 days in June, July and August. However, this is the opposite tendency in the average number of days with rainfall in Canberra which slightly increases from 7 days in February to 10 days in June, July and August.To sum up, Canberra has rainy and cold winters, whilst Brisbane has rainy and warm summers.;The line graph and chart below illustrate the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures (in degrees Celsius) and the average number of rainy days per month, from January to December, for Brisbane and Canberra in Australia.Overall, the two cities exhibit similar patterns throughout the year, although Canberra consistently has lower temperatures compared to Brisbane. Additionally, Brisbane experiences a greater average number of rainy days than Canberra for most of the year.Starting with Canberra, the maximum average daily temperatures show a marked decline, dropping from 27 degrees in January to just 11 degrees in July. In contrast, Brisbane's daily maximum temperatures remain relatively stable, ranging from 28 degrees in January to 21 degrees in July. Brisbane records its peak daily maximum temperature of 30 degrees in February, while Canberra sees its lowest daily minimum temperature of 2 degrees in June and July. Moreover, the average number of rainy days in Brisbane experiences a moderate decrease during the winter months, falling from 14 days in February to 7 days in June, July, and August. Conversely, Canberra experiences a slight increase in the average number of rainy days, rising from 7 days in February to 10 days in June, July, and August.In conclusion, Canberra faces cold and rainy winters, while Brisbane has warm and rainy summers.
920;The graph and pie chart below give information on in-house training courses in a large financial company.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The charts illustrated are a representation of some information regarding in-house training courses in a reputable financial company.In the grand scheme of things, more time was spent on technical aspects of the courses than on the other aspects within the year. Quite conversely people spent less time learning about health and safety. Most of the managers and secretaries thought the courses were important for the job but a handful thought it was a waste of valuable time.55 hours in the year were devoted to training courses. Of these, exactly 30 hours were spent on technical skills, 15 on Career Development, 10 on Inter personal skills and 5 hours on Health and safety.The opinion of Managers and Secretaries was also sought as shown in the next chart. Here we see that majority of both managers and secretaries believe the courses are important for the job; about 84% of Secretaries and just around 76% of managers. It makes sense then that only few of these groups of people think the courses are a waste of time (almost 10% for secretaries and just above 10% for managers).Exactly 50% of managers believe the courses are good for net working while a smaller percentage of secretaries, about 43%, are of the same opinion. A good number still believe the courses provide a good excuse for a change - about 66% for Managers and just shy of 65% for Secretaries.";The charts presented depict data on in-house training courses at a respected financial firm. Overall, a significant amount of time was allocated to technical training this past year, while considerably less emphasis was placed on health and safety topics. Most managers and secretaries regarded these training courses as valuable for their roles, though a small minority viewed them as a waste of time.Throughout the year, a total of 55 hours were dedicated to training courses. Specifically, 30 hours were focused on enhancing technical skills, 15 hours on career development, 10 hours on interpersonal skills, and 5 hours on health and safety.The perspectives of managers and secretaries were also gathered, as illustrated in the accompanying chart. A majority from both groups consider the courses essential for their jobs, with approximately 84% of secretaries and around 76% of managers expressing this view. Consequently, only a small fraction believes the courses are unproductive, with nearly 10% of secretaries and just over 10% of managers holding that opinion.Half of the managers feel that the courses facilitate networking opportunities, while a slightly lower percentage of secretaries—about 43%—share this sentiment. Additionally, a significant portion believes the courses serve as a good reason for a change in routine, with around 66% of managers and just under 65% of secretaries agreeing.
922;The graph below compares figures for the production and consumption of energy in the US from 1950 to 2000. It also predicts figures for 2025.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The line chart gives the comparision figure about how energy produced and consumed by the U.S.A. in a 50 year period starting in 1950 along with a 25 year projection. There is two lines, one representing the American energy's consumption and the other about the energy production in the U.S.A between 1950 and 2000 and the forecast figure from 2001 to 2025. Those were measured by British thermal Units.By and large, the consumption and production of energy in the U.S.A. grew strongly over the period from 35 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to approximately 90 quadrillion Btu in 2000 and from 25 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to 65 quadrillion Btu in 2000 respectively. There are a prediction in energry consumption reaching 135 quadrillion Btu in 2025 and 75 quadrillion Btu in energy production.The first detail to note is that the consumption and production of engery rose steadily over the period. They were significant fluctuation at the start of the period but had risen to around 50 quadrillion Btu in 1975. This was followed by the another fluctuation between 1975 and 2000 and recovered by nearly 90 quadrillion Btu in energy consumption in 2000 and 65 quadrillion Btu in energy production.The amount of energy consumption in the United States is projected to remain much higher and will be increased as much as energy production overall. Amercian willl spend 75 quadrillion Btu in energy consumption more than in energy production in the prediction of 2025.;The line chart illustrates the comparison of energy production and consumption in the United States over a 50-year period, beginning in 1950, alongside a 25-year forecast. It features two lines: one representing energy consumption and the other denoting energy production in the U.S. from 1950 to 2000, with projections for 2001 to 2025. The measurements are indicated in British thermal units (Btu).Overall, both energy consumption and production in the U.S. experienced significant growth from 35 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to approximately 90 quadrillion Btu in 2000 for consumption, and from 25 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to 65 quadrillion Btu in 2000 for production. Predictions suggest that energy consumption will reach 135 quadrillion Btu by 2025, while energy production is expected to increase to 75 quadrillion Btu.A key observation is that energy consumption and production exhibited a steady upward trend over the period, with notable fluctuations early on. By 1975, both consumption and production had risen to around 50 quadrillion Btu. After experiencing another fluctuation between 1975 and 2000, consumption rebounded to nearly 90 quadrillion Btu in 2000, compared to 65 quadrillion Btu in production.Looking ahead, the U.S. is projected to maintain a significantly higher level of energy consumption compared to production. By 2025, it is estimated that Americans will consume 75 quadrillion Btu more than they produce.

According to the graph, farming, fishing and foresting had singled out all the other types of labors and appeared to be the major source of employment in from 1930 to 1960, which had an emplyment rate up to almost 80, but as the US society became modernized, the employment rate in the those traditional types of work had dropped dramatically since 1970, and reached almost the lowest point of zero in 2010, whereas the other three types of labor-industrial, Sales and Office and Technical shared an average growth from 1970 to 2010.The modernization of US society and the developments of urban areas had changed the labor market, as labors in the technical, industrial and service fields were in high demands. In 1930, the employment rates of these industries remained under 20, but they started to increase in 1970. Industrial labor had the most rapid growth, which rose to almost 40 in 2010. It was followed by technical work, which also reached an approximate point of 30 in 2010. Salse and Office came into the third place, which slightly increased to 20 in the end of 2000s. Nevertheless, the of ""other services"" was the category in exception, as it remained unchanged since 1970 and maintained the average point of 10.";"The line graph below depicts the trends in the labor force in the USA from 1930 to 2010. As shown, agriculture, fishing, and forestry dominated employment from 1930 to 1960, boasting an employment rate of nearly 80%. However, with the modernization of American society, the employment rates in these traditional sectors plummeted after 1970, eventually nearing zero by 2010. In contrast, the other three sectors—industrial, sales and office, and technical—experienced steady growth from 1970 to 2010.The modernization and urbanization of the US transformed the labor market, leading to increased demand for workers in the technical, industrial, and service sectors. In 1930, employment rates in these industries were below 20%, but they began to rise significantly by 1970. Industrial jobs saw the most rapid growth, reaching nearly 40% by 2010, while technical roles closely followed, approaching 30%. Sales and office positions ranked third, with a slight increase to around 20% by the end of the 2000s. Notably, the ""other services"" category remained stagnant since 1970, consistently holding at an average of 10%."

Their fluctuations of price were similar.In 2000, food price was 90 points, and oil price was $30. Then, both prices had slowly increased till 2007. Suddenly, food price and oil price both had a drastic jump in 2008. Separately, food index price reached to 220 points，meanwhile oil price was beyond $220 where was the highest price in the historical record. Strangely, both prices dropped sharply in 2009, food price returned to 140 points same as the previous price in 2007, and oil price returned to less $40 same as the previous price in 2005. However, since 2009, food price and oil price both performed a shaking tendency. Finally, food price reached to the new highest points, 140 in 2011, and oil price was weaker than food price, which was $100 in 2011.Global food price and oil price are the two dominant index to expose the change of the global financial market. They interact with each other.;The graph illustrates the changes in food and oil prices on a global scale from 2000 to 2011, highlighting their similar price fluctuations. In 2000, the food price stood at 90 points, while the oil price was $30. Both prices gradually increased until 2007, before experiencing a significant surge in 2008. In that year, the food price index soared to 220 points, and oil prices exceeded $220, marking a historic peak. Interestingly, both prices plummeted in 2009, with food prices falling back to 140 points—similar to their level in 2007—and oil prices dropping to below $40, akin to their value in 2005. From 2009 onward, both food and oil prices exhibited a fluctuating trend. By 2011, food prices reached a new high at 140 points, while oil prices remained lower at $100.Global food and oil prices are key indicators of shifts in the global financial market, with their movements closely intertwined.
898;The graph below shows how money was spent on different forms of entertainment over a five year period.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The provided barr chart depicts the proportion of money spent on several entertainment categories in three different locations from 1995 to 2000.Overall, television in the US was the entertainment sector with the highest income in 2000, whereas, cinema and video received the lowest income over the same 5 years period in the three locations.The barr chart shows that television had the highest amount of money in 2000 reaching 100 out of 257. In contrast, in 1995, the US television had just above 50 out of 184. Similarly, television in Europe had the same income of the latter in 2000.On the other hand, cinema and video categories were the sectors with the lowest income of the three locations. In Asia, for example, cinema and television represent just a small fraction of the income. Similar patterns can be seen in Europe and the US.;The bar chart illustrates the distribution of spending across various entertainment categories in three different regions between 1995 and 2000. Overall, television emerged as the highest-grossing entertainment sector in the US by 2000, while both cinema and video garnered the least revenue across all three locations during the five-year period. The data reveals that in 2000, television in the US generated a substantial income of 100 out of a total of 257. This is a notable increase from just over 50 out of 184 in 1995. Similarly, television in Europe also matched the US figure from 1995, reaching the same income level by 2000. Conversely, the cinema and video sectors consistently recorded the lowest earnings among the three regions. For instance, in Asia, cinema and video accounted for only a minor share of the overall income, a trend that is similarly reflected in both Europe and the US.
852;The graph below shows information on employment rates across 6 countries in 1995 and 2005.Summarise the information by choosing and describe the main idea, and make comparisons where appropriate.;The bar chart sheds light on how employment rates of each gender changed from 1995 to 2005 in six nations: Australia, Switzerland, Iceland, Britain, New Zealand and the United States.Overall, there are mainly two trends suggested by this diagram. First, the employment rates of males were higher than those of females in both 1995 and 2005 across all six countries. Second, this period witnessed an increase in the employment rates of both genders in all countries.As shown in this graph, the large gender gap of employment took place in Iceland, Australia and New Zealand where the difference of employment percentage between males and females reached approximately 30% in both 1995 and 2005. In the other countries, the difference was between 10% and 15%.It is also apparent that an increase of around 10%-15% in employment proportions appeared in each gender across all nations, especially in Australia where the percentage of employed men rose from about 56% to 70% while that of employed women went up from nearly 26% to 38%.;The bar chart illustrates the changes in employment rates for each gender between 1995 and 2005 across six countries: Australia, Switzerland, Iceland, Britain, New Zealand, and the United States. In general, the chart reveals two main trends. First, male employment rates outstripped those of females in both 1995 and 2005 in all six nations. Second, there was an overall increase in employment rates for both genders in every country during this period.The data indicates that the largest gender employment gap occurred in Iceland, Australia, and New Zealand, where the disparity between male and female employment rates was approximately 30% in both years. In contrast, the differences in other countries ranged from 10% to 15%.Additionally, it is evident that both genders experienced an increase of roughly 10% to 15% in employment rates across all nations. Notably, Australia showed a significant rise, with the employment rate for men climbing from about 56% to 70%, while the rate for women increased from nearly 26% to 38%.
1018;The graph below shows the amounts of waste produced by three companies over a period of 15 years.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The line graph gives us informations about how much tonnes of waste is created by three companies between the year 2000 and 2015. It can be observed that majority of the companies reduced their waste in this period and become more eco-friendly.Overall, while company A nd B were reducing their waste, company C provided more waste from 2000 to 2015. Also, company B recorded significant drop from 2005 to 2015.Taking a closer look at the graph, it can be seen that company A created the most waste in the beginning. They recorded 12 tonnes of wastes in the year 2000, however, they reduced their waste consistently in the following years and produced less than 9 tonnes in 2015. Unfortunetly, company C increased their waste records in this period. While they produced little over 3 tonnes of waste in 2000, they rose this record regularly to over 9 tonnes in 2015.On the other hand, company B increased their waste from 2000 to 2005 with reaching over 9 tonnes in 2005 from around 8 tonnes in 2000. However, there is a major drop between 2005 and 2015. They decreased their waste from over 9 tonnes in 2005 to 3 tonnes in 2015.;The line graph illustrates the amount of waste generated by three companies from 2000 to 2015. It is evident that most of the companies diminished their waste during this period and adopted more environmentally friendly practices.In summary, while Companies A and B successfully reduced their waste, Company C experienced an increase in waste production from 2000 to 2015. Notably, Company B saw a significant decrease in waste between 2005 and 2015.Examining the graph more closely, it is apparent that Company A was the largest waste producer at the onset, generating 12 tonnes in 2000. However, they consistently decreased their waste output over the years, bringing it down to under 9 tonnes by 2015. In contrast, Company C’s waste production escalated during this timeframe, starting at just over 3 tonnes in 2000 and increasing steadily to over 9 tonnes by 2015.On the other hand, Company B's waste output rose from 2000 to 2005, increasing from approximately 8 tonnes to over 9 tonnes in 2005. However, they experienced a significant drop in waste between 2005 and 2015, reducing their waste from over 9 tonnes to just 3 tonnes by 2015.

The unit used in the graph is thousandsOverall, the lakes had the lowest amount of visitors in the graph in 1987 by 10 thousand visitors in oppose the coast had the most number of visitors in the graph in 2007 by slightly over 70 thousand visitors. The mountains had the lowest amount of visitors in all the times visitors combined while the coast and the lakes were really close to each other in the overall amount of vistors nearly the same amount of visitors.In the period from 1987 to 1992 The coast had the highest number of visitors by approximately 40 thousand visitors while the lakes had the lowest number of visitors by nearly 10 thousand visitors and the mountains were the middle between them by slightly over 20 thousand visitors.In the period from 1992 to 1997 the coast also was the highest number of visitors by around 40 thousand visitors in meantime the lakes was lower than the mountains it was above 15 by littile and the mountains were above 25 but the lakes suprisingly rocketed and achived the mountains even went more by 30 thousand approximately.;The graph below depicts the number of international visitors to three different locations (the coast, the mountains, and the lakes) in a European country from 1987 to 2007, with figures expressed in thousands.In summary, the lakes recorded the fewest visitors in 1987, with only 10 thousand, while the coast attracted the highest number in 2007, surpassing 70 thousand. Throughout the entire period, the mountains consistently had the lowest visitor numbers, whereas the coast and the lakes were closely matched in their overall visitor counts.From 1987 to 1992, the coast maintained the highest visitor count, reaching approximately 40 thousand, while the lakes remained at the bottom with nearly 10 thousand. The mountains fell in between, attracting just over 20 thousand visitors.Between 1992 and 1997, the coast again led in visitor numbers, with about 40 thousand. The lakes, however, lagged behind the mountains slightly, with figures just above 15 thousand compared to the mountains' over 25 thousand. Interestingly, the lakes experienced a significant increase during this period, ultimately surpassing the mountains by around 30 thousand visitors.
972;The graph below shows the number of university graduates in Canada from 1992 to 2007.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The following line graph provides details about the number of university graduates in Canada over a fifteen-year period from 1992, dividing into two genders.Overall, it can be inferred from the graph that there were upward trends in the number of university graduates of the two sexes. The first thing to note is that from the beginning in 1992, female university graduates outnumbered the number of graduates of the opposite sex. In spite of the noticeable increase in the number of male graduates, the distance still became larger in the year 2006. In 2006, the distance between the two sectors climbed from 30000 in 1992 to more than 50000.Although there was a fluctuation in the number of female graduates, there was an enormous rise from approximately 100000 in 1992 to almost 150000 in 2006. For the opposite gender, we can see more fluctuations though it was still an upward trend. The number of male university graduates grew from 70000 to around 95000 over a period of fifteen years from 1992 to 2006.;The line graph below illustrates the number of university graduates in Canada over a fifteen-year span from 1992. It breaks this data down by gender.Overall, the graph indicates a general increase in the number of graduates for both males and females. Notably, from the outset in 1992, female graduates consistently outnumbered their male counterparts. Despite a significant rise in male graduates, the gap between the two genders widened by 2006. Specifically, this gap increased from 30,000 in 1992 to over 50,000 in 2006.While the number of female graduates experienced some fluctuations, there was a substantial growth from approximately 100,000 in 1992 to nearly 150,000 in 2006. In contrast, male graduates displayed more variability, yet still showed an upward trend, with their numbers rising from 70,000 to around 95,000 over the same fifteen-year period.

Interestingly, the percentage of people choosing to go to the cinemas on Fridays remained stable at 30% through the whole three years.In 2003, only one in ten people decided to go to the cinemas on Mondays, as opposed to the two fifths of people choosing to go on Saturdays and the just under a third of people opting for Sundays. In 2005, the trend experienced a downward trend during weekdays but eventually rose significantly to just under a half and just over a third during weekends, outracing the rate of 2003 and 2007. Lastly, in 2007 the rate continued to present considerable fluctuations, hitting a high point of approximately two fifths on Saturdays.;The bar chart displays the percentage of individuals visiting cinemas in a particular European country on various weekdays over a three-year period from 2003 to 2007. Overall, the number of people attending movie theaters on weekdays experienced significant fluctuations from 2003 to 2007, with Saturdays being the most popular day for cinema-goers. Notably, the percentage of attendees on Fridays remained consistent at 30% throughout the three years.In 2003, just 10% of people chose to go to the cinemas on Mondays, compared to 40% on Saturdays and nearly 30% on Sundays. By 2005, weekday attendance showed a downward trend, though weekend visits saw a notable increase, reaching nearly 50% on Saturdays and just over 33% on Sundays—higher than the figures from both 2003 and 2007. Finally, in 2007, attendance continued to vary significantly, peaking at around 40% on Saturdays.

Meanwhile USA expected to have the lowest rate .A closer examination of the graph , it's seem that population in Japan was at low point in 1940 with 5% and remain relatively stable till 2020 .Afterwards the trend shows increase slightly to 10% in 2025However, speculation of dramatic growth in trend after 2025 to reach 27% by 2040. Meanwhile in Sweden the data started 7% in 1940 .Athough the trend went up and down till 2020 with 15%.Nevertheless, expected to raise considerably to 25% in 2040.Likewise, in USA the data shows fluctuations starting with 10% in 1940 and expected to end by 23 % in 2040 .;The line chart illustrates the percentage of the population aged 65 and older in three countries—Japan, the USA, and Sweden—from 1940 to 2040. Overall, the data suggests that Japan is projected to have the highest percentage of elderly people by 2040, while the USA is anticipated to have the lowest rate.A closer look at the graph reveals that Japan's population aged 65 and over was at a low of 5% in 1940 and remained relatively stable until 2020. Following that period, the trend shows a slight increase to 10% by 2025. However, there is speculation of significant growth thereafter, with projections suggesting it could reach 27% by 2040. Similarly, Sweden's data began at 7% in 1940, experiencing fluctuations until 2020, where it reached 15%. By 2040, it is expected to rise significantly to 25%. In contrast, the USA's figures show variability, starting at 10% in 1940 and projected to rise to 23% by 2040.
1182;The graph shows Underground Station passenger numbers in London.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The line graph illustrates the Underground Station passenger numbers in London which were recorded between the time of 6.00 am to 22.00 pm.Overall, at 8.00 am the number of passengers recorded the highest value which was 400, also the number of passengers at 18.00 pm was about 380. That said it's clear those times had the highest value due to the people going to their work and people leaving.On the other hand, at 10.00 am the number of passengers decreased dramatically to 180. In addition from 12.00 pm to 14.00 pm, the number of passengers slightly increased from 280 to 310. There was a sharp decrease from 14.00 pm to 16.00 pm in the number of passengers where it reached 100. Also, another sudden drop from 18.00 pm to 20.00 pm in the number of passengers occurred where was recorded 120.Furthermore, at 6.00 am and 16.00 pm the number of passengers recorded almost the same value of 100. It can be concluded people's busy time during the day can affect the number of passengers that take the underground station.;The line graph depicts the number of passengers using Underground Stations in London, recorded between 6:00 AM and 10:00 PM. Overall, peak passenger numbers were observed at 8:00 AM, reaching a high of 400, followed closely by a count of approximately 380 at 6:00 PM. These spikes can be attributed to commuters traveling to work in the morning and returning home in the evening.Conversely, there was a significant drop in passenger numbers at 10:00 AM, falling to 180. From 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM, there was a slight increase in passenger numbers, rising from 280 to 310. However, from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, there was a sharp decline, with numbers plummeting to 100. Another notable drop occurred between 6:00 PM and 8:00 PM, where the number of passengers fell to 120.Additionally, both 6:00 AM and 4:00 PM saw nearly identical passenger counts of around 100. This data suggests that the fluctuations in passenger numbers throughout the day are largely influenced by peak commuting times.
396;The graphs below show the enrolments of overseas students and local students in Australian universities over a ten year period.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The two graphs compare the development of the students' enrollments for both groups of local and overseas students in Australian universities between the year of 2001 and 2010. Considering the overall trend of both of the groups for the commencing category, the trend seems to be positive with overseas students, while being quite stagnated within the local students.The total number of enrollments associates with a relatively different development compared to the commencing category. For the overseas students, the trend is strongly possively correlated among the whole period, while for the local students, the positive trend has stopped at year 2007 at the rate of 600000 enrolments per year.For the commencing category, the trend has been over the years relatively positive for the overseas students, except between 2009 and 2010. On the other side, the number of enrolments of local students has slightly degraded in the same period.To summarize, the accumulation of the number of enrolments of both local and overseas students is different and utilizes different trends in the same periods. Neverthless, for the total number of students the difference is not enormous, but rather stagnating for the local students starting at 2007.;The two graphs illustrate the enrollment trends of local and overseas students in Australian universities from 2001 to 2010. Overall, the data shows a positive trend for overseas students in the commencing category, while local student enrollment appears relatively stagnant.In terms of total enrollments, the patterns differ notably. Overseas student enrollments exhibited a strong upward trajectory throughout the entire period, whereas local student enrollments halted their growth around 2007, stabilizing at approximately 600,000 per year.For the commencing category, overseas students generally saw a consistent increase over the years, with the exception of a decline observed between 2009 and 2010. Conversely, local student enrollments experienced a slight decline during this same period.In conclusion, the trends in total enrollments for local and overseas students vary significantly throughout the years. While the overall difference in the total number of students enrolled is not substantial, local enrollments have shown stagnation since 2007.
912;The graphs below show the number of men and women in full and part-time employment in Australia between 1973 and 1993.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;"The graphs compare the participation of full-time and part-time workers in Australia as differenciated by gender and age group in the period betweeen 1973 and 1993.Overall, it is clearly seen that the number of full-time workers for both male and female experienced a slight decline as part-time work become more favourable among these employees. Moreover, despite their gender, there are more people in the age group of 15-19 years old employed for part-time jobs.Based on the age group, it is illustrated that the number of full-time and part-time male workers between 25-49 years old has no significant difference. However, the lines indicated that for female employees the number of people working full-time and part-time were more fluctuated, meaning that age group influenced their employment status. For example, the female employees at the age group of 15-19 years old working full-time was accounted for almost reaching to 50 per cent in 1973, but stepping down to 20 per cent in 1993; while part-time workers at the same age group has a higher number 1993 compared to those who worked in 1973 by around 32 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively.";The graphs illustrate the participation of full-time and part-time workers in Australia, categorized by gender and age group, from 1973 to 1993. Overall, it is evident that the number of full-time workers, both male and female, experienced a slight decline as part-time employment became increasingly appealing. Notably, individuals aged 15 to 19, regardless of gender, were more likely to hold part-time jobs.When examining age groups, the data reveals that there is no significant difference in the number of full-time and part-time male workers aged 25 to 49. In contrast, the trends for female employees show more variability, indicating that age significantly influenced their employment status. For instance, the percentage of female workers in the 15-19 age group employed full-time nearly reached 50% in 1973 but dropped to 20% by 1993. Conversely, the number of part-time female workers in the same age group increased, with 1993 figures showing approximately 32% working part-time compared to 8% in 1973.

Overall, male employees outraced female in manufacturing, finance/banking and defence public sector. While in communications, wholesales & retail trade and non-defence public sector, female workers were higher in the year 1975.In manufacturing, number of male employees was slightly higher than female workers by about 280 thousands. Turning to the finance/banking sector, male employees was three-fold more than female workers. Moreover, men work in defence public sector also made up the biggest part of the total number of employees by approximately 190 thousands.The number of female workers exceeded male employees in three sectors. First, the communications sector, which male workers were less than 50 thousands, while the number of female workers were around 240 thousands. Second, the wholesale & retail trade, the female employees were over 450 thousands but the male workers were lower than 100 thousands. Last sector is the non-defence public sector, the total employees were the highest among others, with about 640 thousands female workers and 200 thousands male workers only.;The chart presents data on the number of female and male employees across six sectors—manufacturing, communications, finance/banking, wholesale & retail trade, non-defence public sector, and defence public sector—in 1975. Overall, men outnumbered women in the manufacturing, finance/banking, and defence public sectors, while women had higher representation in communications, wholesale & retail trade, and the non-defence public sector during that year. In the manufacturing sector, male employees outnumbered female workers by approximately 280,000. In finance/banking, the number of male employees was three times greater than that of female employees. Additionally, men constituted the largest portion of the workforce in the defence public sector, exceeding female employees by around 190,000.Conversely, female workers surpassed male employees in three sectors. In communications, there were fewer than 50,000 male workers compared to around 240,000 female workers. In wholesale & retail trade, female employees numbered over 450,000, while male workers were below 100,000. Lastly, in the non-defence public sector, the total workforce was the highest among all sectors, with approximately 640,000 female employees compared to only 200,000 male employees.
1216;The graphs below show the types of music albums purchased by people in Britain according to sex and age.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The table charts give information about the type of music album that people of different sex and age have bought in Britain. Rock Music is generally the top sellers. The class of people between 25 and 34 years old buy more albums than the others.Rock music is the the more sold type, whereas classical music is the less purchased. However, there is a divergence concerning the type of listeners of the two types of music. Indeed, Rock Music (the most listened type) is particularly listened by people who are aged between 16-35, they exceed the 30%. Instead, Classical Music is particularly interesting for adults which are aged over 45. Indeed, the more than 20% of people of this age buy classical music. By contrast, the yungers, between 16 and 24 years old, who listened to classical music are almost 0%. Pop music, is the second more purchased type. It is purchased by all the types of people even if no one of the class exceed 30% of buyers.There is a difference that concerns the age of people and their musical interests. Nonetheless, people beteen 25 and 35 year old are those who by the most and different types of music. They purchase around 30% of Rock Music's albums, even if the type they buy the most is Rock Music. They are also interested in buying Classical Music. In the opposite position, there are people aged over 45, who are the less versatile listeners. They used to buy Classical Music album (around the 20%) but less that 10% of them buy Pop or Rock Music.;"The tables provide insights into the types of music albums purchased by individuals of various genders and age groups in Britain. Rock music consistently ranks as the best-selling genre, with individuals aged 25 to 34 typically purchasing more albums than other demographics.While Rock music leads in sales, classical music remains the least popular choice. There is a noticeable difference in the listener demographics for each genre. Rock music, which is the most frequently enjoyed genre, appeals predominantly to those aged 16 to 35, with this group making up over 30% of listeners. In contrast, classical music tends to attract adults over the age of 45, with more than 20% of this age group purchasing classical albums. Surprisingly, the younger audience, specifically those aged 16 to 24, shows minimal interest in classical music, with near-zero purchase rates.Pop music ranks as the second most popular genre, appealing to a wide range of audiences; however, no single age group exceeds 30% in sales. There are distinct differences in musical preferences across age groups. Notably, individuals aged 25 to 34 are the most diverse in their musical tastes, purchasing about 30% of Rock music albums while also showing interest in classical music. Conversely, those aged over 45 tend to be less versatile in their listening habits. They typically purchase classical music albums (around 20%), but fewer than 10% show interest in purchasing Pop or Rock music."

638;The line graph below shows the oil production and consumption in China between 1982 and 2006.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;This line graph indicates oil production and consumption per day in China from 1982 to 2006. Clearly, the consumption doubled its production in 2006.To begin with, oil consumption started the millions of oil barrels per day for almost two, and remained the same by 1990. But, its consumption suddenly surged to about 3.7 million in 1994. Then, the number of consumption skyrocketed from 1998 and reached a peak of more than 6 million in 2006. Consequently, the consumption tripled, compared with 1982.Secondly, the production also commenced the millions of oil barrels per day around two, and increased its production to three million in 1986. In contrast, its production leveled off by 1994. Afterward, the production slightly kept going up and resulted in 3.5 million in 2006. As a result, the oil production increased, compared with 1982. But it is clear that the pace of production is quite slower than consumption.;The line graph depicts the daily oil production and consumption in China from 1982 to 2006. Notably, by 2006, consumption had outpaced production, doubling the latter.Initially, oil consumption hovered around two million barrels per day for nearly two decades, remaining stable until 1990. However, it experienced a sharp increase in 1994, rising to approximately 3.7 million barrels. From 1998 onwards, consumption soared, peaking at over 6 million barrels in 2006. This indicates a threefold increase compared to levels in 1982.On the production side, it also began at around two million barrels per day and rose to three million by 1986. In contrast to consumption, production stagnated by 1994. Subsequently, it experienced only a slight increase, reaching 3.5 million barrels in 2006. While production rose compared to 1982, it is evident that its growth rate was significantly slower than that of consumption.

Over half of Mexico, Peru, and Thailand's populations are willing to try insect products, making them the top 3 countries. On the contrary, Japan had an extremely low percentage in 21%.It is evident on the chart that glutinous rice is the the cheapest food product with $0.82/kg, followed by rice, chicken, pork, buffalo, beef, in that respective order. The chart indicates that the most expensive food is weaver ant, with $10.65/kg. There is an apparent trend in the price of insects, they are less affordable compared to other sources of protein. However, water bugs and house crickets are exceptions to that particular trend. It is also worth noting that male water bugs are more expensive than the female water bugs.;The map and chart provide insights into each country's willingness to try insect-based products and the market prices for various foods. Countries showing a high openness to insect products are highlighted in yellow to green, while those with low acceptance are marked in red to orange. Notably, over half the populations of Mexico, Peru, and Thailand express a readiness to sample insect products, ranking them as the top three countries. In contrast, Japan shows a remarkably low willingness at just 21%.The chart reveals that glutinous rice stands out as the most affordable food option at $0.82/kg, followed in cost by rice, chicken, pork, buffalo, and beef in that order. Weaver ants rank as the priciest food item at $10.65/kg. Generally, insects tend to be less economical compared to other protein sources, although water bugs and house crickets deviate from this trend. Interestingly, male water bugs are priced higher than their female counterparts.
882;The map below shows three possible locations for a leisure centre. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;This map describes the possible areas for a leisure centre. It is clear from the graph that the three selected areas have different characterestics which make each of them as unique place.According to what is shown, place A is very close to some industries and that make it unsuitable to be a leisure center. Moreover, this area is not healthy due to the pollution that comes from the industries' smok.For the second area (B), this location is close to the some buildings where people live and that is good choice. However, the only negative of this place is that it will be noise. However, location C is the beast due to its location. It is located faraway from any kind of pollution. People can breath fresh air and enjoy the grean areas.To summarize, we could say that, location C has several positives that make it the best choice for a leisure centre.;This map illustrates potential locations for a leisure centre, highlighting the unique characteristics of each of the three selected areas. According to the data, Area A is situated near industrial zones, making it an unsuitable choice for a leisure centre due to the pollution generated by the nearby factories. Consequently, this area lacks a healthy environment.In contrast, Area B is in proximity to residential buildings, which is a positive aspect for potential visitors. However, it may suffer from noise disturbances, which could detract from the leisure experience. On the other hand, Area C stands out as the best option, as it is distanced from sources of pollution. This offers visitors fresh air and access to green spaces, contributing to a more enjoyable atmosphere.In conclusion, Area C presents multiple advantages that make it the most ideal choice for a leisure centre.
938;The maps below show the development of a small fishing village and its surrounding area into a large European tourist resort.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The map illustrates on how a fishing village with a population of 12,000 people in 1974 has been converted to a European tourist resort in 2004 which can accommodate 80,000 residents and 50,000 tourist beds.Except for the fishing village, all other places were modified.It is apparent from the map that there has been a huge loss of flora and fauna on this restructure. Dense woodland was replaced with hotels and golf course. Areas allocated for sheep and goats and olives cultivation were converted into tourist shops and farmland for harvesting fruits and vegetables to serve tourists at hotels.A portion of village, harbour and place were boats were stationed has been relocated to accommodate tourists to have a sea view.A pathway has been created from top of the mountain to the beach to facilitate tourist travel different destinations.Consequently, there has been a huge loss in habitat and probably a shift in fishermen jobs. For survival, fishermen would have taken up jobs like working in tourist shops, serving tourists at restaurant and guiding tourists.;The map depicts the transformation of a fishing village with a population of 12,000 in 1974 into a European tourist resort by 2004, capable of housing 80,000 residents and offering 50,000 tourist beds. Aside from the fishing village, all other areas underwent significant modifications. The map clearly indicates a substantial decline in local flora and fauna due to these changes. Lush woodlands were replaced by hotels and a golf course, while regions previously designated for sheep, goats, and olive cultivation were converted into tourist shops and farmland dedicated to growing fruits and vegetables for hotel visitors. A section of the village, along with its harbor and docking area for boats, has been relocated to provide tourists with sea views. Additionally, a pathway was constructed, extending from the mountain's summit down to the beach, to facilitate travel to various tourist destinations. As a result, there has been a considerable loss of habitat, likely leading to a shift in the employment landscape for fishermen, who may have transitioned into roles such as working in tourist shops, serving at restaurants, or guiding visitors.
825;The movement of people from the countryside into the cities is happening in many parts of the world, resulting in the problems, especially in cities.What are the causes of this movement, and how can it be reversedGive reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;People move from the countryside into the cities. It occurs in many parts of the world, causing problems, especially in urban areas. This essay will elaborate on the causes of this movement, and the way it can be reversed from my personal standpoint.Centralization has caused this movement. All the major institutions and facilities are in the cities. Thus, people in rural areas have to sacrifice considerable time and effort to travel to urban centres. As it is also costly, people choose to move into the cities so that traveling does not consume their time. For instance, one-fifth of the total population in Korea currently lives in Seoul, the capital city of Korea. In fact, all the educational, medical, and entertainment facilities are centralized in urban areas. It can be reserved by implementing decentralization. The government has to disperse the location of the major institutions and diverse types of facilities into different districts so that people living in remote areas can also benefit.Furthermore, people in remote areas want to earn opportunities for better employment or education. As a city is a point where technologies, investments ,and professions gather, there is a better opportunity for people to get employed or educated in a improved quality. Therefore, people choose to leave the countryside. Thereby, the government can initiate the policies in which firms earn benefit when they move their head office to districts. If the firms commence moving, it will produce a great amount of employment.Conclusively, not only the government but also the businesses and institutions have to co-operate to combat problems resulting from a surge in the movement of people from the countryside into the cities.;People are migrating from rural areas to urban centers, a trend observed in many parts of the world that presents various challenges, particularly in cities. This essay will discuss the factors driving this migration and explore potential solutions from my perspective.One major reason for this urban migration is centralization. Most key institutions and essential services are located in cities, forcing individuals in rural regions to invest significant time and energy traveling to urban areas. The high costs associated with this travel further motivate people to relocate to cities, where they can save time. For example, currently, one-fifth of South Korea's population resides in Seoul, the nation's capital, where educational, medical, and entertainment facilities are concentrated. To address this issue, a strategy of decentralization should be implemented. The government should distribute major institutions and diverse services across various districts, ensuring that those in remote areas have access to the same benefits.Moreover, individuals in rural areas seek greater opportunities for employment and education. Cities serve as hubs for technology, investment, and various professions, providing enhanced prospects for job seekers and students. Consequently, many people opt to leave the countryside in search of better opportunities. To counter this trend, the government can introduce policies that incentivize companies to relocate their headquarters to less populated districts, which could lead to a significant increase in local job creation.In conclusion, tackling the challenges posed by the influx of people moving from rural areas to cities requires cooperation among the government, businesses, and institutions. By working together, they can develop effective strategies to mitigate the issues arising from this migration pattern.
1299;The number of advertisements for charities on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. What is causing this? Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It indeed appears true that the frequency with which advertisements for charities appear both on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. There can be various explanations for this and it can be seen in both a positive and negative light.One explanation for the increase in the number of charity advertisements is that the charities themselves are becoming more aggressive in their marketing. This can also be seen in the common strategy nowadays to encourage a monthly donation, rather than a one-off donation. The increased marketing is apparent too in the increased numbers of ‘street salespeople’, who stop passersby and try to get them to commit to this monthly payment.A second reason for the increase could also be that there have been more charities started and the number of advertisements would therefore increase and become more noticeable. If these charities are all legitimate, this would mean that more help will be getting to causes that need it. The increase in charities could also be explained by a possible increase of humanitarian awareness. People might be now adopting different ideologies that take into account people in less advantageous positions.If the number of advertisements for charities has risen due to the fact that there has been a positive shift in people’s compassionate principles, this surely has to be seen as an optimistic development. If it is due to the fact that governments have been cutting back, it could be seen as a pessimistic development. In addition, if there are more charities asking for more money, this will inevitably mean that the amount of money donated will have to be more thinly spread, which would be a negative development.There could be several reasons for why there are more charity advertisements today. Whatever the reasons, as long as any money is helping people in disadvantageous positions, it must be seen as a positive development.;"It does seem evident that the frequency of charity advertisements on television and the Internet is on the rise. This trend can be interpreted in both positive and negative ways, and several factors may contribute to it. One reason for the increase in charity advertising could be that organizations are becoming more proactive in their marketing strategies. A common approach today is to promote monthly donations rather than one-time contributions, which is reflected in the growing presence of ""street fundraisers"" who engage passersby to encourage these ongoing commitments.Another possible explanation for the uptick in charity ads is the emergence of new charitable organizations, leading to a higher volume of advertisements that capture public attention. If these charities are indeed legitimate, this could mean more support for causes that require assistance. Additionally, there might be a surge in humanitarian awareness, with more people embracing ideologies that consider the needs of those in less fortunate circumstances.If the rise in charity advertisements is a reflection of a positive shift in people's compassion, it should be regarded as an encouraging development. Conversely, if it stems from government cutbacks, it could signal a more troubling trend. Furthermore, an increase in the number of charities seeking donations may result in funds being spread more thinly, which would be less favorable.Ultimately, while there could be multiple reasons behind the growing presence of charity advertisements, any money that aids those in need can be viewed positively, regardless of the underlying motivations."
466;The picture below shows how a hot balloon works. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features.You should write at least 150 words.;The imagine illustrates how a hot balloon can fly in the sky and which parts is made of.In brief, a hot ballon is composed by a basket, burner where a flame is produced to heat cool air and an envelope connected to it by a skirt and ropes.

In the first step, the essential ingredients—4 cups of 00 flour, 325 grams of water (approximately one and a half cups), and half a teaspoon of dry active yeast—are combined in a bowl. Next, the mixture is transferred to a stand mixer, where the dough goes through three mixing phases: the first and third phases are at slow speed for 2 minutes each, while the second phase is at medium speed for 5 minutes. Following this, the dough is allowed to rest until its volume doubles, which will take at least 2 hours. Once rested, the dough is gently pressed to remove any air bubbles, and can then be evenly divided into three equal portions, each weighing approximately 275 grams.
1372;The proportion of older people is increasing, what problems will this cause and what solutions can be suggested?;In many countries the proportion of older people is steadily increasing. What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.It is true that nowadays people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences to this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.As people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. In other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. A second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. Finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent vital healthcare, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of senior citizens.In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.This essay covers the task requirements, however some problems of aging population get only a brief mention. The linking of sentences in the second body paragraph is somewhat ‘mechanical’ and could have been improved. Information sequencing and organisation in paragraphs are done well. The range of vocabulary and the fluency of its use, as well as lack of errors are impressive. Overall, this is a good example of how to get Band 8 without writing a very long essay.;In numerous countries, the percentage of older individuals is gradually rising. This demographic shift poses various challenges for both individuals and society as a whole. It’s essential to consider potential solutions to mitigate the effects of an aging population. In today's industrialized nations, people are living longer than ever before. While this trend brings certain advantages, it also raises significant concerns. As the population ages, we can expect a range of interconnected issues. The foremost concern is the increasing number of retirees who will qualify for pensions. This will lead to a smaller proportion of working-age individuals, resulting in reduced tax revenues in relation to the entire population. Consequently, this shift will place a heavier tax burden on the working population. Additionally, there will be heightened demand for healthcare services, and many adults will need to provide care for their elderly family members.To address these challenges, governments could implement several measures. One straightforward approach would be to raise the retirement age for workers, potentially from 65 to 70, as many individuals in this age group are fit enough to contribute actively in the workforce. Another strategy could be to promote immigration to boost the number of working adults contributing taxes. Lastly, it will be necessary for governments to reallocate funds from different sectors to enhance healthcare, housing, and transportation services for the growing senior citizen population.In conclusion, there are multiple strategies that can be employed to address the challenges posed by aging populations. This essay fulfills the task requirements, although some issues related to an aging population are only briefly mentioned. The connections between sentences in the second body paragraph could be improved for better coherence. Overall, the organization and sequencing of ideas in the paragraphs are effective. The varied vocabulary and fluent style, along with the absence of significant errors, are commendable. Ultimately, this essay serves as a solid example of achieving a Band 8 score without the necessity of lengthy writing.
1242;The table below describes the number of employees and factories in England and Wales from 1851 to 1901.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The table below shows the total number of employees,including male and female employees, and factories in England and Wales throught out the 60 year period from 1851 to 1901.Overall, it can be clearly seen that the total numbers of people employed had decreased over the period, whereas the number of factories had increased and only went down in the last 20 years.The number of male employees had a significant drop in the first decade,losing more than half the number of employees in 1851 and gradually decline overtime.Additionally,Female employees had a major in incline in the second decade which is exactly 100 thousands employees and countinued to decrease like male employees.As a result, the total number of employees declined noticeably in the first 20 years and steadliy went down for the next 40 years.In contrary,the number of factories increased considerably,reaching 721 factories in 1881 then slowly went downward afterwards.;The table below presents the total number of employees, encompassing both male and female workers, as well as the number of factories in England and Wales over a 60-year span from 1851 to 1901. Overall, it is evident that the total employment figures decreased during this period, while the number of factories initially increased, only experiencing a downturn in the final 20 years. In the first decade, the number of male employees saw a dramatic decline, with more than half of the workforce from 1851 lost, followed by a gradual decrease over time. In contrast, female employment experienced significant growth in the second decade, with an increase of exactly 100,000 workers, before also following a downward trend akin to that of male employment. Consequently, the total number of employees notably declined in the first 20 years and continued to decrease steadily for the subsequent 40 years. Conversely, the number of factories surged considerably, reaching a peak of 721 in 1881, before gradually declining thereafter.

However, the percentage change in those four devided age groups was not as same as the all ages, to the contrary, two of these groups just showed opposite trend.In terms of all ages, the number in 2012 was 4,460,000, compared to the number in 2011, the percentage change increased 0,6 , which was as same as the percentage change of the 40-64 age group. Besides, we can easily see that the change in 65+ group was the most significant one, with the figure in 2011 500,000, increased 400,000, approximately double in the following year.As for the two decending age groups, under 15 and 15-39, the percentage change were both -0,2 , although the specific numbers were different. The age under 15 amounted to 801,750, was merely declined 1,750 in 2012, at the same time, the number of 15-39 group was largely decreased, changed from 1,520,000 to 1.500,000 in 2012.;"The table presents the changes in the population of New Zealand from 2011 to 2012, categorized into four age groups. Overall, the total population saw an increase; however, the percentage changes among these four age groups varied significantly, with two groups displaying a contrary trend.In 2012, the total population stood at 4,460,000, reflecting a percentage change of 0.6 compared to 2011, which aligned with the percentage change of the 40-64 age group. Notably, the 65+ age group experienced the most remarkable growth, rising from 500,000 in 2011 to 900,000 in 2012, an increase of 400,000, nearly doubling the previous year's figure.Conversely, the two younger age groups, those under 15 and aged 15-39, both recorded percentage changes of -0.2, despite differing specific numbers. The population under 15 decreased slightly by 1,750, totaling 801,750 in 2012. In contrast, the 15-39 age group saw a more substantial decline, dropping from 1,520,000 to 1,500,000."

Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The table is presenting that amount in litres of milk production at these four diffrent coutries in specific three each year during 20 years term.Netherlands and Australia are producing significantly big number of litres milk, compare with those other countries. In 1990, Netherland and Australia is almost same amout of milk production was done, then in 2000, Australia is slightly less than Netherland which is 50000 difference. In 2010, those two countries have big differencies of number of litres wich is more than 2 milion litres.Other two countries are much less production than First two countires. Nevertherless, Tanzania is still the one of the big producer of milk which is third place of this table.Guatemala is small producer, but those 20 years, production is much increase which is 60000;The table displays the volume of milk production in liters from four different countries over a specific three-year period within a 20-year timeframe. The Netherlands and Australia produce a significantly larger volume of milk compared to the other two countries. In 1990, their milk production levels were nearly identical. By 2000, Australia's production fell slightly behind the Netherlands by 50,000 liters. However, by 2010, the gap widened considerably, with a difference of more than 2 million liters between the two.The remaining countries, Tanzania and Guatemala, have much lower production levels compared to the Netherlands and Australia.

892;The table below shows the salaries of secondary/high school teachers in 2009. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparison where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The table gives information about the salaries of secondary school teachers in different countries in 2009. The main differences between the countries are two. First, a discrepancy concerns the starting salary of teachers. Second, there is a gap in the years that teachers need to teach before obtaining the maximum salary.On the one hand, the starting salaries of teachers in the selected countries are slightly different. Luxemburg teachers reach the highest starting salary, equal to 80,000. Instead, in Australia, there are the least paid teachers, they have less than 30,000 per year. There is an enormous discrepancy between Luxemburg, in which the starting salaries are the highest ones, and the other countries. Although Denmark is the second country in giving higher salaries, the money teachers reach the first years of teaching is 45.000.On the other hand, another discrepancy concerns the years that a teacher has to teach before reaching the maximum salary. Indeed, despite being the least-paid teachers, Australians obtain the maximum salary after 9 years of teaching and obtain 48.000 per year. Instead, Luxemburg requires 30 years of work to give teachers the maximum salary, which is also the highest among the countries, and corresponds to 130.000. Denmark is the country in which high-school teachers obtain the maximum salary in just 8 years. On the completely opposite side, Japan teachers have to teach for at least 37 years before obtaining the highest salary.;The table provides details on the salaries of secondary school teachers across various countries in 2009. Two key differences stand out between these nations. Firstly, there is a variation in the starting salaries of teachers. Secondly, the length of time required for teachers to achieve the maximum salary also differs significantly.On one hand, the starting salaries for teachers in the selected countries show notable disparities. Teachers in Luxembourg earn the highest starting salary at 80,000, while those in Australia receive the lowest, with an annual salary of less than 30,000. This creates a substantial gap between Luxembourg's starting salaries and those of the other countries. Although Denmark offers the second-highest starting salary, its teachers earn 45,000 during their initial years.On the other hand, the duration of time teachers must serve before reaching the maximum salary also varies across these countries. Despite being the lowest-paid teachers, Australians can achieve the maximum salary after just nine years of service, earning 48,000 per year. In contrast, Luxembourg requires teachers to work for 30 years to attain the highest salary, which is also the highest amount offered among these countries, at 130,000. Meanwhile, Denmark enables high school teachers to reach the maximum salary in only eight years. In stark contrast, teachers in Japan must work for at least 37 years to achieve their highest salary.

However, the increase was the most marked from 1990 to 1995.In the given statistics, Europeans are the ones who like to travel the most and the middle east is the place where least people went for trips internationally. While Africa and Asia and the Pacific experienced a similar increasing trend of travellers from 1995 to 2005.In America, people showed a great willingness to travel abroad between 1990 to 1995. But, then the number stayed more or less at the same level till 2005. Likewise, Europe also experienced a significant increase from 1990 to 2000 in travelling abroad. But, after 1995, there was an increase of around 10 million only.Overall, Europe contributed the most in overseas travel, whereas the Middle East had the least share of overseas travelers.;"The table illustrates the variations in the number of international travelers across various regions during the years 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005. It is evident that there was a notable increase in the total number of international travelers over this 15-year span, with the most significant growth occurring between 1990 and 1995. The data reveals that Europeans are the most enthusiastic travelers, while the Middle East garnered the least international visitors. In contrast, Africa and Asia-Pacific experienced a similar upward trend in traveler numbers from 1995 to 2005.In the Americas, there was a strong appetite for international travel from 1990 to 1995; however, the figures stabilized at around the same level until 2005. Similarly, Europe saw a substantial rise in overseas travel from 1990 to 2000, but following 1995, the increase amounted to merely around 10 million.In summary, Europe accounted for the highest number of overseas travelers, whereas the Middle East had the smallest share of international trips."
836;The table displays the average monthly rainfall for the year in five cities of the world.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The following table gives information on the average monthly rainfall in five cities. In the first row of the table, every month of the year is shown, from January to December. In the first column of the table, five cities are visible; Hongkong,Tokyo,Jakarta,Cairo, and London. The following cities are from very different parts of the world, this why there is great differences between the values. The city with the least rainfall was Cairo, hence there was not any rain from September to December, while Hongkong and Jakarta have had significantly more rain throughout the year. Hongkong peaked at 380mm of rain in August, and experienced the greatest fluctiation in monthly rainfall, with the biggest difference between January and August. In Tokyo, there is a steady increase in monthly rainfall from January to December, with only slight deviations. Jakrata seen the most rain in January, with an outstanding 300mm, which decreases until August, then starts increasing again until December. London is the most consistent out of the 5 cities, with the biggest difference between months being 25mm of rain.";The table below presents average monthly rainfall data for five cities: Hong Kong, Tokyo, Jakarta, Cairo, and London. The first row lists the months from January to December, while the first column identifies each city. These cities are located in diverse regions, leading to significant variations in rainfall amounts. Cairo recorded the lowest levels of rainfall, experiencing no rain from September to December, whereas Hong Kong and Jakarta had considerably higher levels of precipitation throughout the year. Hong Kong recorded its highest rainfall in August at 380mm, showing the greatest fluctuation in monthly precipitation with a notable disparity between January and August. Tokyo exhibited a gradual increase in monthly rainfall from January to December, with only minor fluctuations. Jakarta experienced its peak rainfall in January at an impressive 300mm, which then declined until August before rising again towards December. London displayed the most consistent rainfall patterns among the five cities, with the largest variation between months being just 25mm.
788;The table displays trends concerning the amounts of fast food consumed in Melbourne. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevantYou should write at least 150 words.;The table outlines the past, present, and future consumption of five types of fast food. Comparing the consumption in 2005 with the present level, it is clear that all consumptios of fast food has increased since 2005 except for the hamburger. While this trend suggests that hamburger consumption is in decline, projected consumption in 2025 shows that burgers would gain renewed interest.Moving the attention away from hamburgers, we can see that the increase in salad consumption is more drastic than that of other fast food categories. Specifically, the predicted increase in fried chicken consumption is 10 units, which is outshadowed by the 36-unit increase for salad. This suggests that, while more fast food will be consumed overall, the general public is shifting towards healthier options.Finally, although the consumption for hamburger, friedn chicken, and salad all increased significantly, figures for fried rice and noodles remained stagnant. This suggests that both fried rice and noodles are less welcomed by the consumers compared to other fast food.;The table presents the past, present, and future consumption trends of five types of fast food. A comparison between 2005 and current consumption levels reveals that all fast food categories, with the exception of hamburgers, have experienced an increase since 2005. While this indicates a decline in hamburger consumption, projections for 2025 suggest a resurgence in interest in burgers.Shifting focus from hamburgers, it's evident that salad consumption has seen a more significant rise compared to other fast food types. Specifically, the anticipated increase in fried chicken consumption is 10 units, but this pales in comparison to the expected 36-unit growth for salads. This trend indicates that, although overall fast food consumption is on the rise, the public is increasingly gravitating towards healthier options.Finally, despite the notable increases in consumption for hamburgers, fried chicken, and salads, the consumption figures for fried rice and noodles have remained stagnant. This suggests that these two items are less favored by consumers compared to other fast food alternatives.
889;The tendency of news reports in the media to focus more on problems and emergencies rather than on positive developments is harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole.To what extent do you agree or disagree?;News reports in the media focus on problems and emergencies more often than on some positive events. Is it really harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole?Let us consider the purpose of the media existence first. I suppose it is to spread important information, so that people may use it in their lives. And problems are usually more important than some positive developments, since, in fact, they are the things which people should be aware of in the first place. For example, due to the COVID, which is an international problem, many people lost their jobs. If they had been notified about the rising of pandemic though, they would have prepared somehow (save more money by cutting unnecessary expenses, learn a new profession and so forth).Moreover, I believe problems shall be solved. And when people are concerned about some problems, they may tend to face them with honor and participate in solving them. For instance, the energy crisis is a huge problem, and it is important to aware society of it, so that individuals could try to be more careful with gas and electricity. In the end, society will benefit from it, so it is not harmful.On the other hand, there is some negative impact of bad news on individuals sometimes. But I am sure it should be considered as psychological issues of particular individuals, rather than a problem of today's media system. People just should not fall in despair because of news reports, but think how they could take an advantage of the provided information to minimize a negative impact and help humanity to solve problems.Finally, in my view, the stated tendency is not really harmful to society, but it may sometimes be harmful to the individuals, and they are responsible for it.;"Media coverage tends to prioritize problems and emergencies over positive events. But does this trend truly have negative effects on individuals and society? First, let's examine the role of the media. Its primary purpose is to disseminate important information that people can use in their lives. Typically, problems demand more attention than positive developments, as it is crucial for individuals to stay informed about challenges that may affect them. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic poses an international crisis; had people been alerted to its emergence sooner, they could have taken proactive steps, such as saving money or learning new skills.Furthermore, addressing problems can inspire individuals to engage actively in finding solutions. Raising awareness about significant issues, like the energy crisis, encourages society to be more mindful of resource consumption, ultimately benefiting everyone. Thus, highlighting these problems is not detrimental.Conversely, it's true that negative news can sometimes adversely affect individuals. However, this should be viewed as a matter of personal resilience rather than a flaw in the media system itself. People should strive not to succumb to despair when confronted with distressing news. Instead, they should focus on how to utilize the information to mitigate negative effects and contribute to solving broader issues.In summary, while the media's focus on negative events may occasionally harm individual well-being, it is not fundamentally detrimental to society as a whole. Individuals must take responsibility for their responses to the news they consume."
112;The two tables below show the exchange students from universities in Europe to Australia between 2007 and 2009.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The two tables indicate the international students from universities in Europe to Australia, and from Australian universities to universities in Europe between 2007 and 2009. Overall, An increase in total can be seen from European students to Australia in 2009, while the total number of Australian student remained the same from 2007 to 2009.To go into detail, there are two countries the number of students increased from European international students to Australia. Specifically, It is Sweden, and Germany. It was 34,27 in 2007 in Sweden and Germany, whereas it was 42 and 62 in Sweden and Germany in 2009 respectively. Especially in German students, the number doubled. On the other hand, other countries, such as France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherland can be seen a slight reduction from 2007 to 2009. But the total number increased from 189 to 226, in 2007, and 2009.When it comes to Australian international students who study in Europe, have not changed the total number of students. It is 152, in 2007 and 2009. On the other hand, the number of students soared in two countries, such as France, and Germany.It was 37, 18 in France, and Germany in 2007 respectively. It increased to 58, 26 in France and Germany. In contrast, there are reduction in three countries, in Sweden, The United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Especially in the Netherland, the number of Australian students plummeted from 32 to 18 between 2007 and 2009.France and Germany in 2009.;The two tables present data on the movement of international students between European universities and Australian universities from 2007 to 2009. Overall, there was an increase in the number of European students studying in Australia by 2009, while the total number of Australian students studying in Europe remained unchanged during the same period.Examining the details, the number of students from two countries—Sweden and Germany—who traveled to Australia rose significantly. In 2007, the combined total from Sweden and Germany was 34 and 27, respectively. By 2009, these figures had risen to 42 for Sweden and 62 for Germany, with the number of German students notably doubling. Conversely, countries such as France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands saw a slight decline in student numbers from 2007 to 2009. Nevertheless, the overall total of European students heading to Australia increased from 189 in 2007 to 226 in 2009.As for Australian students studying in Europe, the total remained stable at 152 from 2007 to 2009. However, there was a significant surge in the number of students from France and Germany, which saw increases from 37 and 18 in 2007 to 58 and 26 in 2009, respectively. In contrast, there were declines in the number of Australian students in Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, with the most notable drop occurring in the Netherlands, where student numbers fell from 32 to 18 between 2007 and 2009.
661;The typical teaching situation of a teacher and students in the class will not exist by the year 2050. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;For many years, the traditional teaching and learning (T&L) approach, i.e., having a teacher disseminating knowledge to a group of students in a classroom, is dominent over the world.With the advancement of information and communication technology, new learning approaches have been proposed and adopted. For example, students can now use computers to surf the internet to find information or knowledge they would like to study. Moreover, a number of pre-recorded education contents are now available online to provide classes/tutorials to learners. It is expected that this tradition T&L approach will not exist by 2050. Would it be true?There is no doube that there is an increasing number of T&L approaches due to emergence of new technologies. Together with the new approaches, we see there is a shift of the role of teachers these years, not only as one who is responsible to disseminate knowledge, but also a faciliator of learning. Teachers provide proper directions to students during their study, where current technology is not able to offer. Some people say the artificial technology is a threat, but still the accuracy of providing suggestions to students is not very high. Moreover, human teachers are able to provide emotional support to students. Studying is not just a robotic process of human beings. Students may encounter difficulties during the learning process and feel frustrated, which will eventually affect their progression in study. Human teachers could be more aware on this situation, not by the numeric assessment results, but the emotional behaviour of the students in the classroom, and provide prompt and proper counselling support and advice to the students.Also, it is still well-known that computers, even with AI, are weak in creating new knowledge. In the university setting, other than teaching the conventional knowledge, professors would disseminate their new research findings to the students in the class, with discussion among the students, inspiring them to the unexplored areas. This T&L process can only be effective when it happens in a classroom setting.In conclusion, technology may alter the way how we teach and learn. In spite of this, human teachers are also adaptive and certain roles of the teachers cannot be replaced by other tools or machines. Therefore, I believe that the tradition classroom T&L setting cannot be replaced completedly in the future.;"For many years, the conventional teaching and learning (T&L) model—a teacher imparting knowledge to a group of students in a classroom—has dominated education worldwide. However, with the rise of information and communication technology, innovative learning strategies have emerged and gained acceptance. Students can now utilize computers to browse the internet for information relevant to their studies, and a wealth of pre-recorded educational content is available online, offering classes and tutorials. Predictions suggest that traditional T&L methods may become obsolete by 2050, but is this true?There is no doubt that the proliferation of new technologies has sparked an increase in diverse T&L methodologies. Alongside these developments, the role of teachers is undergoing a transformation; they are evolving from mere knowledge disseminators to facilitators of learning. Teachers guide students through their educational journeys, fulfilling a role that technology cannot replicate. While some argue that artificial intelligence poses a threat, its ability to provide accurate suggestions remains limited. Moreover, human teachers offer the emotional support that students need. Education is not merely a mechanical process; learners may face challenges and experience frustration, impacting their academic progress. Human teachers are better positioned to recognize these emotional cues—not just through numerical assessments but by observing students' behaviors in the classroom—and can offer timely and appropriate counseling and advice.Additionally, it's widely acknowledged that computers, even those equipped with AI, struggle to generate new knowledge. In university settings, professors not only teach established knowledge but also share their latest research findings with students, fostering discussions that inspire exploration of uncharted territories. This dynamic learning process is most effective in a classroom environment.In summary, while technology may change the landscape of teaching and learning, human educators are adaptable, and certain aspects of their roles cannot be replicated by machines or tools. Therefore, I believe that traditional classroom-based T&L cannot be entirely replaced in the future."
803;The use of corporal punishment (physically hitting students) in schools is in decline, yet it should be used to improve behaviour.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people believe that modifying behaviour among school-going children can be achieved through corporal punishment, and that it being on the decline in schools, is actually a negative development. I strongly disagree with this this view as I am of the opinion that there are better ways of disciplining children to instill positive behaviour, than physically hitting them.Improvement of behaviour among children in schools can be achieved through teaching them good manners rather than using corporal punishment. This means that teachers and school staff should teach children acceptable and unacceptable behaviour as part of their school curriculum from the earleist age they enter school. This way, learners obtain knowledge required for them to practice good behaviour. For example, if a child is taught from primary school-going age that they should clean after their mess, they are likely to practise and carry this behaviour through to secondary school. That way, there would be no need to physically hit children. Although some may firmly believe that corporal punishment is a good form of discipline, it cannot be compared to the actual teaching of good behaviour.Moreover, corporal punishment is likely to produce a fearful and resentful child rather than a well mannered child. It has been found by many researchers that children are unlikely to change their bad behaviour because they are beaten up at school. The behaviour is most likely to get worse, instead, as learners become fearful and resent their learning environment. For instance, in South Africa, some learners were reported to be disrespectful to their teachers because of a bad relationship that existed between them and their teachers as a result of corporal punishment that was inflicted on them. While it may be true that some positive behaviour changes were seen among pupils due to use of corporal punishment, this is at a very small scale.In conclusion, I am of the view that the use of corporal punishment among school-going age children is not a desirable phenomenon, as it is unlikely to produce any required behavioural changes. Instead, instilling good manners in learners through teaching them is more effective, as physically hitting them may even worsen their undesirable behaviour.;"Some individuals argue that corporal punishment is an effective method for modifying the behavior of school-age children and believe that its decline in educational institutions is a negative trend. However, I strongly disagree with this perspective, as I believe there are more effective ways to discipline children that promote positive behavior without resorting to physical punishment.Enhancing children's behavior in schools can be achieved by teaching them proper manners rather than employing corporal punishment. Educators and school personnel should incorporate lessons on acceptable and unacceptable behaviors into the curriculum from the earliest stages of a child's education. This approach equips students with the knowledge they need to adopt good behavior. For instance, if children learn the importance of cleaning up after themselves from a young age, they are more likely to continue this practice into their teenage years. This approach eliminates the need for physical discipline. Although some people may strongly advocate for corporal punishment as a form of discipline, it cannot rival the effectiveness of directly teaching appropriate behavior.Furthermore, corporal punishment often instills fear and resentment in children, rather than fostering good manners. Research has shown that physical punishment is unlikely to lead to meaningful changes in behavior; instead, it may exacerbate issues as children become fearful and develop negative feelings towards their educational environment. For example, in South Africa, some students have exhibited disrespect toward their teachers due to the strained relationships stemming from corporal punishment. While there might be isolated instances of positive behavior change attributed to corporal punishment, these are minimal in scale.In conclusion, I believe that the use of corporal punishment among school-age children is not a suitable practice, as it is unlikely to achieve the desired behavioral modifications. Instead, teaching children good manners and appropriate behavior is a more effective strategy, as physical punishment can often lead to a deterioration in behavior rather than improvement."
623;The use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction among many people in society. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;The modern world of social interaction changed completely over the past decades. Now many of us spent much more time interracting through social media, messengers for private or corporate messaging. We also use video conference and sharing our workflow remotely.As for me we have different needs satisfied by communication formed by different systems in our brain. On the one hand we have we communicate with each other aiming to get a useful information. On the other hand communication gives some non-verbal part like a sense of neing involved into one process, belonging to a circle of friends, collegues or family. These two sides of the process of communication are implemented differently that's why each part gets its own advantages and disadvantages thanks to changing integrating new social network technologies.If to talk about an information exchange - as for it became much more efficient with using messages, cloud storages and different coworking tools. But it is true only for those people who use these technology well. As far as I can see many advantages in remote work such as possibility not to waste time for commuting, offices and separate equipment, many people notice that their remote collegues disapperar often and avoid their duties. Some people couldn't concentrate while working at home. As for me people who experince such a problems are just addicted to strong stimules such as face-to face interraction and being managed by their boss. At the same time different internet based tools allow you to share much more information much faster and forever. Now you cannot just forget you task because you can always revise it in your work messenger and cloud folder wherever and whenever you are.One another need - is to have a social interraction. Of course ssocial network give us some advantage even in this area - now we can keep our relationships with more people across longer distances. While moving to another city or country we do not feel isolation so much anymore. It allows us to mentain or ralationships longer and stronger. At the same time such an option give people a possibility to avoid face-to-face communication with people phisically close to them. As for me it gives only one disadvantage - it is getting harder to load some parts of our brain which are evolutionary oriented to face-to-face interraction.I can conclude that social media interraction gave us some new possibilities and cut off some of the old ones. At the same time modern technologies blur boundaries between a real conversation and internet communication. Now we can perfectly see and hear each-other and even support financially. There are also some devises wich allow you to feel even more - like touches or heartrythm of each other. I think that new social media tools and some next directions of these tools will satisfy our face-to-face communication needs more and more over time.;The landscape of social interaction has transformed dramatically over the past few decades. Nowadays, many of us spend a significant amount of time communicating through social media, messaging platforms for both personal and professional use, and video conferencing, which allows us to collaborate remotely.From my perspective, our communication fulfills various needs, governed by different systems in our brains. On one hand, we engage in conversations to obtain useful information. On the other hand, communication also fulfills a non-verbal component, providing a sense of involvement in shared experiences and fostering a sense of belonging among friends, colleagues, and family. These two aspects of communication are realized in distinct ways, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, particularly as new social networking technologies emerge.When it comes to information exchange, the efficiency has greatly improved through the use of messaging apps, cloud storage, and various collaborative tools. However, this benefit applies primarily to those who have mastered these technologies. While I find numerous advantages in remote work—such as the elimination of commuting, shared office spaces, and the need for specialized equipment—many individuals have noticed that their remote colleagues often disappear or neglect their responsibilities. Additionally, some struggle to concentrate while working from home. I believe that those facing such challenges may be overly reliant on strong stimuli like face-to-face interactions and direct oversight from a manager. Conversely, internet-based tools enable us to share vast amounts of information quickly and indefinitely. We can easily revisit tasks in our messaging platforms or cloud folders, regardless of our location or time.Another essential aspect of social interaction is the ability to connect with others. Social networks certainly offer advantages in this domain, allowing us to maintain relationships with a broader array of people across great distances. When we relocate to a new city or country, we experience far less isolation than we once would have. This facilitates longer and stronger relationships. However, this convenience also allows some individuals to avoid face-to-face interactions with those physically nearby. Personally, I see this as a drawback, as it becomes increasingly challenging to engage the parts of our brains that evolved for in-person interaction.In conclusion, social media interaction has opened up new avenues for communication while diminishing some traditional ones. Modern technologies blur the lines between genuine conversation and online interaction. We can now see and hear each other clearly and even provide financial support. There are also devices being developed that enhance our sensory experiences, such as simulating touch or heartbeats. I believe that as new social media tools continue to evolve, they will increasingly cater to our innate need for face-to-face communication.

It is clear from the graph that the female is higher than male of percentage.According to what is shown, gradually increased from 19 to 34 ages same that from 35 to 54 ages. Between 55 and 64 ages is siginficant increased about between 19 and 24 ages, After that gradually decreased between 65 and 74. Although, Supposed to 25 and 34 ages, They the more consum but between 55 and 64 ages they is consum the highest. Also, The 75 age is the same percentage, unlike the all under 75 ages.To sum up, we could say that, the all ages is not equal between male and female in same percentage ages, except 75 age, They slight by 25 per cent between unisex. On other hand, Female and male is equal consume in 75 age.;This bar chart illustrates the percentage of males and females in the UK who consume five or more portions of fruits and vegetables each day. The data clearly shows that a higher percentage of females meet this dietary guideline compared to males. The graph indicates a gradual increase in consumption from ages 19 to 34, and a similar trend is observed for those aged 35 to 54. A significant rise is noted in the 55 to 64 age group, contrasting with the decrease seen in the 65 to 74 age range. While individuals aged 25 to 34 demonstrate higher consumption levels, the 55 to 64 age cohort consumes the most. Interestingly, the percentage for those aged 75 remains consistent with that of younger groups below age 75.In summary, the data highlights disparities in fruit and vegetable consumption between males and females across various age groups, with the exception of those aged 75, where both genders have equal consumption rates. Overall, there is a difference of about 25 percent in consumption between the sexes in all age groups except for those aged 75.
1426;The world is experiencing a dramatic increase in population, which is causing problems not only for poor, undeveloped countries, but also for industrialized and developed nations. Describe some of the problems that overpopulation causes, and suggest at least one possible solution.;You should write at least 250 words.You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.Nowadays, the population dramatically in most countries around the world. This is true for the developed and developing nations. Overpopulation a different number of problems. However, the government can these problems in many .There are several problems that the raising number of people in undeveloped countries causes. Firstly, it is very difficult to provide enough food for all people. Secondly, the government limits the number of children per family in school. In addition, in poorest countries usually have , and when the population increases, the number of . Finally, when too many people live on the land, the environment suffers.There are different problems that overpopulation causes in rich nations. Firstly, it is very difficult for governments to provide helpful public services in overcrowded cities. Moreover, there is generally a higher level of crimes being committed, such as drugs abuse, murders, thefts, . often cause by the high rates of unemployment.However, overpopulation problems in nations have two main which they are by governments. Firstly, the government must educate people about limiting the size of the family. For example, in China they have a policy called “one child policy” which limits the size of the family to one or two children, and this is beginning to have an effect on the world’s most crowded nation.To sum up, if the impulsive population increase continues, many more people will die of hunger in the poor countries. Also, in rich nations, the life in the cities will become more and more difficult.;"You should aim to write a minimum of 250 words and allocate approximately 40 minutes for this task. In today’s world, population growth is a significant issue affecting nations across the globe, regardless of their economic status. Both developed and developing countries are experiencing dramatic increases in their populations, leading to a range of pressing challenges. However, governments have the capability to address these issues through various strategies.In developing nations, the rapid rise in population brings about several serious problems. One of the foremost challenges is food security; providing sufficient food for every individual becomes increasingly difficult. Additionally, many governments impose limitations on the number of children families can have, which can have a direct impact on school enrollment and education opportunities. Moreover, the lack of resources in the poorest countries often results in inadequate healthcare, and as the population grows, the strain on these essential services intensifies. Furthermore, overpopulation leads to environmental degradation, as increased land use can result in deforestation and loss of biodiversity.In contrast, wealthier nations face different consequences due to overpopulation. Urban areas become overcrowded, making it challenging for governments to deliver effective public services, such as transportation, healthcare, and education. This overcrowding often correlates with a rise in crime rates, including drug abuse, theft, and violence, frequently exacerbated by high unemployment rates and social unrest.To combat these overpopulation-related challenges, governments must implement effective policies. One such measure includes educating citizens about family planning and the importance of limiting family size. A notable example is China's former ""one-child policy,"" which successfully reduced population growth and has begun to yield positive effects.In conclusion, if the rapid increase in population continues unchecked, dire consequences await, particularly in poorer nations where hunger could become even more prevalent. Meanwhile, in affluent countries, urban life may grow increasingly challenging, necessitating urgent attention from policymakers. Addressing overpopulation effectively is essential for ensuring a sustainable and balanced future for all nations."
1313;There are many things that can motivate people to perform well in their work. These can include the salary, job satisfaction or the chance to help others. What do you feel is the best motivation to do well at work?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"To perform well in a job, people have to be motivated. There are multiple strategies for employers to incentivise their employees. The most obvious one is the salary; however, job satisfaction and the ability to help people are other methods of improving performance at work.For the majority of the people, receiving their salary at the end of the month is their motivation. This is because money is necessary to fulfill the most basic needs and other materialistic desires. Employees see these opportunities when receiving their salary and therefore work to achieve money. Furthermore, performing well in a job can often lead to promotions with higher pay packages. To receive this, staff have to stand out positively in their jobs. Salary is therefore a key motivational tool for many workforce participants.However, money is far from being the only incentive. Another aspect affecting performance is job satisfaction. If a person is comfortable in their work, they are more likely to perform well. Therefore this motivational tool interlinks with salary, as when people are content and perform well, the chances of promotion increase. For some individuals though, only their passion can drive them. Prime examples for this are humanitarian jobs. The salaries are often not very high, but those choosing to work in this field are often very driven; their passion to help others is prioritised over their own salary.In conclusion, while income might be the most common motivational factor, it is unusual to be the sole incentive for working hard, and some people are motivated wholly due to other reasons.";"To succeed in a job, individuals must be motivated. Employers can employ various strategies to inspire their employees, with salary being the most apparent incentive. However, job satisfaction and the opportunity to make a positive impact also play significant roles in enhancing workplace performance. For many, the monthly paycheck serves as their main motivator, as financial compensation is essential for meeting basic needs and fulfilling material desires. Employees recognize these incentives when they receive their salaries, which drives them to work diligently. Additionally, excelling in their roles can lead to promotions accompanied by higher salaries, making it essential for staff to distinguish themselves positively in their work. Thus, salary acts as a crucial motivational factor for a large portion of the workforce. Nonetheless, financial compensation is not the only motivator. Job satisfaction significantly influences performance as well. When individuals feel comfortable and content in their roles, they are more likely to excel. This aspect of motivation is interconnected with salary; as employees find fulfillment in their work and perform better, their chances of advancement increase. For some, however, passion serves as the primary driving force. For instance, in humanitarian roles, salaries may not be very high, yet those who choose these careers are often deeply driven by their desire to help others, prioritizing their mission over financial gain.In summary, while income is typically the most recognized motivator, it is rarely the sole reason individuals work hard, as many draw inspiration from other factors."
1284;There is a moral necessity today for the richer countries of the world to help the poorer countries develop in terms of feeding the population, education and health care. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The world today is often divided into two categories, more developed and less developed countries. This division is significant in terms of health, wealth and education. To minimise this gap, it is argued that richer countries are morally responsible to support the less wealthy. I, personally, feel that the prosperous countries are obligated and expected to to contribute to the development of countries with weaker economies.To address this argument, the history of the wealthy countries is relevant. Many less developed countries are former colonies, therefore the wealthy countries had a historical impact on the less wealthy. Thus, richer countries’ economies were dependent on the currently less developed countries for their rich status. Furthermore, even today the wealthy countries contribute to the wealth inequality by exploiting the inhabitants of less developed countries, giving workers lower wages than people within their own countries. Due to this dependence on poorer countries and the influence that the richer countries have had on the imbalance, it can be concluded that richer countries are indeed morally obliged to help the less wealthy countries.Opposing this is the view that each country is in charge of their own inhabitants and that therefore they need to provide health, education and basic necessities for themselves. In addition, simply providing these three services would not lead to closing the wealth gap. It would rather be helpful to invest sustainably in poorer countries and help them create their own systems, allowing these countries to be self-sufficient.In conclusion, while there is a moral necessity for wealthy countries to aid the poorer ones, simply providing basic necessities is not sufficient. A more sustainable idea would be to teach countries to plan and provide for themselves by giving economic incentives.;Today, the global landscape is often categorized into developed and developing nations. This distinction has significant implications for health, wealth, and education. To bridge this gap, it is argued that wealthier nations bear a moral obligation to assist those that are less affluent. I personally believe that prosperous countries have a duty to contribute to the advancement of nations with weaker economies. The historical context of wealthy nations is important to this discussion. Many developing countries were formerly colonized, which means that wealthier nations have historically influenced the economic conditions of the less affluent. In fact, the prosperity of richer countries has often been linked to their exploitation of these nations. Furthermore, even today, wealthier nations perpetuate economic disparities by underpaying workers in developing countries compared to their domestic counterparts. Given this historical dependence and the ongoing inequalities created by richer nations, it follows that they have a moral responsibility to assist the less fortunate.On the other hand, there is a perspective that each nation should be responsible for its own citizens, ensuring access to health care, education, and basic needs. Moreover, merely providing these basic services may not effectively close the wealth gap. A more effective approach would involve investing in sustainable development, empowering poorer countries to establish their own systems and achieve self-sufficiency.In conclusion, while it is morally imperative for affluent nations to support poorer ones, simply supplying fundamental necessities is inadequate. A more sustainable strategy would involve equipping these countries with the tools to plan for and provide for themselves through economic incentives.
1217;There is growing evidence that man-made activities are making global temperatures higher.What might be the man-made causes of temperatures rising? How should we deal with this problem?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In the last years the problem of global warming is becaming more and more debated. One of the main causes of the temperature rising are men-made activities. Almost all the activities made by humans produce a huge impact on the natural environment. For instance, some of the usual activities made daily by people are impacting. Indeed, the chemical products they buy and use as well as the ways of trasportation's abuse can be annoverated among the main reasons for global warming. Lastly, even if it is the more impacting, there is the industral system and their production of slags.The first impact made by men-activities concerns the product they use. There are at least three kinds of products that may cause the rising of temperature. First, there are products like lacquaer and foam. Because they were beed uncontrolled used during the last decades, they have been one of the main causes of the Ozone Hole. Spray products, even if they are just suncream or hair conditionars could be very impacting because of their chemical composition. Another men-activity that impact a lot on the environment concern their use of the way of transportation. Indeed, the abuse of private ways of trasportation caused an increasement of pollution and a dramatic increase of the level of petrol in the environment. Petrol is not only one of the main reason for global warming but also the first responsible for sea's pollution. Furthermore, the dayly use of flight cause pollution in the air and now restriction on the abuse of this way of trasportation are trying to be a kind of solution to the problem.Lastly, one of the main causes of global temperatures higher is the industrial system. Indeed, they used to point to the cheaper solution to produce and eliminate the radioactive waste. The problem of a prodaction that does not take care of the environment pointed to use polluting products and machines. Furthermore, the industrial system point to produce more and more causing the waste of energy and raw materials. For instance, the fashion industry is one of the more pulluting in the world. It abuses of materials and energies whithout caring abuut the waste of them. Finally, the problem of the way in which the industries procede in elimnating waste is crucial. Indeed, in the last years they used to disperse the waste on the sea. This tendecy was increased for two reasosns: saving and speed. These are the two eassential words of industrial system.In conclusion, I think there are two main reasons that cause the raising of global temperatures that can be annoverated among the others. Those that concern the personal and daily activities of men (use of determinate products and ways of trasportation) and then those activities operate by the industrial system.;In recent years, the issue of global warming has become increasingly prominent in discussions. A significant contributor to rising temperatures is human activity. Almost every action taken by people has a substantial impact on the natural environment. For instance, everyday activities can have far-reaching consequences. The chemical products that individuals purchase and utilize, along with over-reliance on various forms of transportation, are among the leading causes of global warming. Additionally, the industrial system, particularly its production of waste, represents one of the most significant factors.The first impact of human activities relates to the products we consume. There are at least three types of products that contribute to temperature increases. The first category includes items like aerosol sprays and foams. Due to their uncontrolled use over the past few decades, these products have been major contributors to the depletion of the ozone layer. Even common items like sunscreen and hair conditioners can be quite harmful because of their chemical compositions. Another critical aspect of human impact lies in transportation choices. The excessive use of private vehicles has resulted in increased pollution and a dramatic rise in fossil fuel emissions. Oil is not only a primary factor in global warming but also a leading cause of ocean pollution. Moreover, frequent air travel contributes to air pollution, leading to restrictions aimed at mitigating its overuse.Finally, one of the main drivers of rising global temperatures is the industrial sector. Industries often prioritize cost-effective methods of production and waste disposal, frequently at the expense of environmental health. This approach commonly involves using polluting substances and machinery, and it often leads to wasteful energy use and depletion of resources. For instance, the fashion industry stands out as one of the most polluting sectors in the world, consuming materials and energy without regard for waste management. The manner in which industries dispose of waste is crucial. In recent years, many have resorted to dumping waste into the ocean, driven by a desire to save costs and time—an approach that epitomizes the prevailing industrial mindset.In conclusion, I believe there are two primary reasons behind the increase in global temperatures worth highlighting: the personal and daily behaviors of individuals—such as the use of specific products and transportation methods—and the practices of the industrial sector.
1427;There is no longer enough natural resources to sustain current levels of economic growth. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Recently, the natural resources risen dramatically across the world due to population growth. Some people state that we enough resources. However, there are some individuals who disagree with this opinion. In this essay, the issues behind this phenomenon will be examined.On the one hand, some people state that if will continue to we cannot have a comfortable life because natural resources are limited. According to a if this situation will continue, the petrol will in 2050. Moreover, it is widely said that the will increase. This will make the amount of natural .On the other hand, there are some individuals who disagree with above-mentioned perception. The natural resources will technology. For example, the of technology such as cars a positive impact the society. By using this, we can the consumption of natural resources. Eventually, we will not need natural fuel. In my opinion, of natural is , I think the loss of it a negative impact the society because won’t have a comfortable life any more.In conclusion, I agree with the idea that there is no longer enough natural resources to sustain this situation. In order to our life, the governments countries should tackle this issue.;Recently, natural resources have significantly decreased around the world due to population growth. Some individuals argue that we still have sufficient resources. However, there are others who challenge this viewpoint. This essay will explore the underlying issues of this situation.On one hand, some believe that if the current trend continues, our quality of life will suffer because natural resources are finite. For instance, it is projected that oil supplies may be depleted by 2050 if consumption patterns persist. Furthermore, it is widely acknowledged that population growth will accelerate the depletion of these resources.On the other hand, some individuals disagree with the aforementioned perspective. They argue that advancements in technology will help us manage natural resources more efficiently. For example, innovations in technology, like electric vehicles, can have a positive impact on society. By adopting such technologies, we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, potentially diminishing the need for non-renewable resources altogether.In my opinion, the depletion of natural resources is indeed concerning, and I believe that its loss could negatively affect society, as it may lead to a decline in our standard of living.In conclusion, I agree with the notion that there may no longer be enough natural resources to sustain our current trajectory. To improve our quality of life, governments worldwide must address this pressing issue.
1324;These days, many young people are not spending their weekends and holidays doing outdoor activities such as hiking or mountaineering. Why is that happening? How can they be encouraged to spend more time in the natural environment?;Nowadays, the younger generation tends to avoid recreational activities such as hiking or alpinism. It seems that young people prefer to spend their weekends indoors, gaming or engaging in other online activities. If that is the case, by promoting sports more actively and organising sports competitions, the schools could counteract this trend.Living in the era of technology, the wide availability and variety of online entertainment are compelling young people to spend a lot of their free time indoors, using their gadgets. Numerous relatively cheap forms of amusement, such as online games, videos, audiobooks and plenty of other activities, tempt teenagers to stay at home and lead more sedentary lifestyles. A recent survey revealed that the vast majority of students would prefer spending their weekends playing computer games, rather than in the nature. That is one clear reason why our modern youth is less interested in recreational sports.To address this issue, the school management could intervene and offer a better range of outdoor sports activities and competitions, both within the school curriculum and as extra-curricular activities. For example, high schools could increase the number of weekly football, running and climbing classes, and organise competitions at the end of each term. As a result, pushed by their desire to win, students would do more walking, jogging, running and mountaineering during the school term, in preparation for the competition. This would reduce the time spent online, lessen the students’ dependence on the Internet for entertainment, and eventually boost their desire to spend more time enjoying the natural environment.To sum up, screen addiction plays a major role in young people’s avoidance of various outdoor activities. Opening up more recreational sports and offering frequent competitions on school grounds is a great way to motivate more students to spend their leisure time in the nature.;Today, the younger generation appears to be steering away from outdoor recreational activities like hiking and climbing. Instead, many young people opt to spend their weekends indoors, engrossed in gaming or other online pursuits. To combat this trend, schools could play a significant role by actively promoting sports and organizing competitions.In our technology-driven age, the abundance of online entertainment increasingly traps young individuals indoors, glued to their devices. Affordable options for entertainment, such as video games, streaming content, and audiobooks, lure teenagers to stay home and adopt more sedentary lifestyles. Recent surveys indicate that most students would rather spend their weekends gaming than exploring nature, highlighting a key reason for the decline in interest in recreational sports among today’s youth.To tackle this concern, school administrations could enhance the variety of outdoor sports activities and competitions available to students, both within the school curriculum and as extracurricular options. For instance, high schools could increase the frequency of football, running, and climbing classes, culminating in competitive events at the end of each term. This competitive spirit could encourage students to engage in more physical activities like walking, jogging, running, and climbing in preparation for these competitions. Ultimately, this could lead to decreased screen time and a reduced reliance on the internet for entertainment, fostering a greater appreciation for the outdoors.In conclusion, screen addiction significantly contributes to the younger generation's tendency to avoid outdoor activities. By introducing more recreational sports and regular competitions on school grounds, we can inspire students to embrace spending their leisure time in nature.
919;To be labelled a ‘Work of Art’, a painting, sculpture or other art form should display certain qualities that are unique. However, over the past century there has been a decline in the quality of prize-winning artwork and it is now possible for quite ordinary pieces of art to be labelled ‘masterpieces ’ whilst true works of art pass unnoticed.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;For centuries, artworks have been titled  'Work of Art' based on their extraordinary qualities. However, some people argue that nowadays, the standards are decreasing and the labelling of substandard artworks as 'masterpieces' has become ubiquitous. The upcoming essay will discuss why I agree that original paintings are being neglected while usual ones are being praised.Firstly, the superficial nature of humans is responsible for this change. These days, people do not see the meaning behind the painting or the message the artist is trying to convey rather they buy those paintings which are popular and contemporary. To illustrate it further, in art auctions it can be seen that when one person bids on one painting, no matter whether it is good or bad, others also start putting their money on it. Thus it is clear that normal art forms are winning prizes due to public attention.Secondly, some artists might bribe the organizers of exhibitions to promote their canvas. Indeed, there have been some recorded instances when artists were caught while signing up deals to increase the sales of their work. If a certain artwork receives publicity then it is impossible that it would not have an influence on the public. This type of promotion skews a person's opinion about a certain picture and so are forced to think about purchasing it, leaving behind original ones. Therefore, it is apparent that the diabolical activities of painters are responsible for their works being labelled as masterpieces.To conclude, the maintenance of social position and influence of painters are the prime causes for the popularity of ordinary artworks and the negligence of true works. Hence I agree with the given statement.;"For centuries, extraordinary artworks have been referred to as 'Works of Art.' However, there is a growing sentiment that contemporary standards are declining, with subpar pieces often being labeled as 'masterpieces.' In this essay, I will explain why I believe that genuine works are being overlooked in favor of more conventional ones.Firstly, the superficial tendencies of society contribute significantly to this shift. Today, many people prioritize trendy and popular artworks over the deeper meanings or messages behind them. For instance, during art auctions, it's common to witness a bandwagon effect; when one individual places a bid on a painting, regardless of its quality, others are quick to follow suit. This behavior highlights how mainstream appeal often dictates which artworks are celebrated, overshadowing more original creations.Secondly, there are instances where artists may resort to unethical practices, such as bribing exhibition organizers to promote their work. There have been documented cases of artists being caught in schemes aimed at boosting sales through undue influence. If an artwork gains significant publicity, it naturally impacts public perception, leading individuals to consider purchasing it rather than exploring more authentic pieces. Consequently, such manipulative tactics further blur the line between true artistry and commercial hype.In conclusion, the quest for social standing and the influence of certain artists are primary drivers behind the elevation of mediocre art at the expense of genuine masterpieces. Thus, I align with the assertion that true artistic works are being unjustly neglected."
1338;Today children are spending much more time watching TV compared to the past. Why do you think this happens? Is this a positive or a negative change?;"A trend has emerged in the last two decades with youngsters watching more TV than ever before. One of the main reasons behind this issue is the recent advancements in technology in gaming and film industries. This tendency has both pros and cons, and will be further discussed in this essay.The latest developments in video game consoles attracted both children and adults to spend extra time watching TV, compared to the past. With interactive gaming characters and high quality graphics, children are more likely to spend long hours playing games in front of the TV. A recent survey showed that TV addiction among young people, for example, has significantly increased from 5% to 80%, which was supposedly caused by the introduction of advanced gaming consoles. This increase is also partially due to films, drama series and cartoons being easily available on pirated websites and various gaming platforms.This trend has had more negative than positive effects on young citizens. More time spent watching TV adversely affects the mental and physical wellbeing of a child. For instance, the obesity ratio among young individuals in the past 10 years has risen dramatically; this has caused further health problems such as anxiety and depression. However, TV can also be used in a positive way. It is a great source of information that can help youngsters increase their knowledge and succeed in their future careers.In conclusion, recent breakthroughs in technology are driving up the amount of time our youngsters are spending in front of their TV screens. This can do more harm than good if we don’t regulate the use of TV, but parents have the power to make TV time useful and beneficial for their children.";In the past two decades, a notable trend has emerged: young people are watching more television than ever before. A key factor contributing to this phenomenon is the significant advancements in technology within the gaming and film industries. This trend presents both advantages and disadvantages, which will be explored further in this essay. The latest developments in video game consoles have led both children and adults to devote more time to television than in previous years. With the arrival of interactive gaming characters and high-quality graphics, children are increasingly inclined to spend extended periods playing games in front of the TV. A recent survey indicates that TV addiction among young people has soared from 5% to 80%, purportedly due to the introduction of sophisticated gaming consoles. This surge can also be attributed to the widespread availability of films, dramas, and cartoons on pirated websites and various gaming platforms.Overall, the implications of this trend are largely negative for young individuals. Increased screen time can harm both their mental and physical health. For example, the obesity rate among youth has risen dramatically over the past decade, leading to additional health issues such as anxiety and depression. Nevertheless, television can also serve a positive purpose. It offers a valuable source of information that can help youth expand their knowledge and excel in their future careers.In conclusion, recent technological advancements are significantly increasing the amount of time young people are spending in front of screens. If not monitored, this trend may yield more detrimental effects than benefits. However, parents have the ability to ensure that TV viewing is both productive and advantageous for their children.
603;Today family members do not eat meals together. Why does this happen? Is this a positive or negative developmentGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Dinner tables are no longer a place for family reunion in today's society. Reasons from many aspects account for this phenomenon which pose a huge threat to the happiness of family and the harmony of society.Causes vary from person to person. Some people, especially the young believing that conflicts are common on dinner tables, tend to have meals with their friends rather than their family members. But most people are deprived of their rights by the development of society. Too busy to get home at dinner time, people have to eat meals near workplace. Also, with the job diversity increasing, rarely can family members with different timetables eat meals at the same period. For instance, a bank agent getting home at 6 pm tends to miss her doctor husband leaving home at 5 pm for emergency work.It is the advantages of sharing meals with family that attach great importance to this event. Time for communication is so critical that families lacking such opportunities are often full of misunderstandings and quarrels. Not only can this development increase the divorce rate but it may also decrease the marriage rate. Because support and care from family, the previous harbor, is deprived and people see no significance from getting married. With such phenomenon prevailing, the negative emotions may take advantage in the society. Loneliness, distress and helplessness stike those always eating alone.In a nutshell, taking the damage to both families and societies into consideration, various solutions should be put forward to the roots behind the situation.;Dinner tables have lost their role as a gathering place for families in today’s society. Several factors contribute to this trend, which poses a significant threat to family happiness and societal harmony. The reasons vary among individuals. Many, particularly younger people, believe that conflicts are common during family meals and therefore prefer dining with friends instead. Additionally, societal advancements often leave people with little time to gather with family for dinner. With busy schedules, many are forced to eat near their workplaces. Furthermore, as job diversity increases, it becomes increasingly rare for family members with differing schedules to eat together. For example, a bank employee who returns home at 6 PM might miss her doctor spouse, who leaves for emergency work at 5 PM.Sharing meals with family holds tremendous importance, as it provides essential opportunities for communication. Families that lack such interactions often experience misunderstandings and conflicts. This disconnect can lead to higher divorce rates and lower marriage rates, as individuals feel deprived of the support and care that family should provide, leading them to question the value of marriage. As this trend continues, negative emotions such as loneliness, distress, and helplessness may spread through society, affecting those who regularly dine alone.In conclusion, to address the damage inflicted on both families and society, it is crucial to explore various solutions that tackle the root causes of this issue.
883;Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;There is no doubt that nowadays advertising plays a very strong role in saling goods. The high rate of sales does not always mean the real needs of some goods. In this essay, i will discuss both views and draw my personal conclusion.In terms of advertising's power in increasing sales of popular consumer goods, advertising has an essencial role these days in sales. The main reason given to support this claim is advertisnig attracts people and inform people about the new and special products in a very special way. To illustrate, using social media for marketing and advertising raise sales dramatecly. People spend most of their times to watch what is in the social media and that means social media is the best way to do your marketing.However, some people say that people buy these products not because they really need them but because they like the way that was used to advertise these products. On the other hand, some times people purchase goods because they have seen them or heard about them from others or from the social media not due to their needs of these products.In conclusion, I believe that increasing the sales of some popular consumer goods show how strong is advertising and how advertising plays a crucial role in saling products. Also, smart business owners should think about advertising as a fast way to sale their goods. As was previously menthond, people can be attracted by all kinds of advertising and that definitly lead to increasing the sale rate.;It is undeniable that advertising plays a significant role in selling products today. A high volume of sales does not necessarily reflect the genuine needs for certain goods. In this essay, I will explore both perspectives and provide my own conclusion.When it comes to the influence of advertising on the sales of popular consumer goods, its impact is undeniable. Advertising captivates and informs consumers about new and unique products in compelling ways. For example, leveraging social media for marketing can dramatically boost sales, as people spend a considerable amount of time engaging with content online. This makes social media an ideal platform for advertising.Conversely, some argue that consumers buy products not out of necessity, but rather because they are drawn to how those products are advertised. In some cases, people may purchase items simply because they have seen them promoted or heard about them through social media, rather than due to an actual need for those products.In conclusion, I believe that the surge in sales of certain popular consumer goods underscores the effectiveness of advertising and its crucial role in driving product sales. Furthermore, savvy business owners should recognize advertising as a powerful tool for selling their products. As previously mentioned, various advertising methods can captivate consumers, ultimately leading to increased sales.
1328;Today’s young generation is facing many problems at school and at home. What are the problems? What can parents do to help their teenage children?;"Young people today are under a lot of pressure, which seems to come from many directions. The problems they are experiencing happen not only at school, but also at home, and it seems that without adult guidance, our young generation will continue to struggle.Teenage years have never been simple, and many would agree that the amount of challenges has only increased with the passage of time. Bullying has been a problem for quite a while, and children and adolescents would have experienced it at school in the past, but then it would stop at home. At present, however, things have been made worse by social media penetrating the supposedly safe space of our teenagers. The unfortunate behaviour of their peers can now reach them even in their bedrooms, causing them constant distress.Another issue troubling many young people is the pressure to succeed by their families. Whether at school or at home, they often feel as if they are not smart enough, which creates overwhelm and despair. Understandably, their parents are pursuing a worthy goal of ensuring their children get a great start in life; however, many teens feel that they are failing their families when they don’t live up to their expectations. This often leads to dishonest and unethical behaviour, such as cheating on tests or plagiarising other students’ work. When uncovered, these incidents have a profound effect on young people’s future careers, not to mention their emotional well-being.It is hard to underestimate the importance of parental support to navigating life as a young person. From helping teens build a positive body image and self-esteem, to handling classmates’ difficult behaviour, to guidance where study is concerned, parents can make a world of difference. Talking to their sons and daughters about matters that worry them, listening and making non-judgmental suggestions are great ways to help. Getting a professional involved where necessary and engaging with teachers, councilors and coaches is another opportunity for parents to provide assistance. Last but not least, parents can make their children better and happier people by simply giving them unconditional love.To sum up, being a young person in the modern world isn’t easy. By banding together and paying careful attention to their teens, families can help them overcome any obstacles to becoming successful adults.";"Today's youth face significant pressures from various sources. The challenges they encounter are not limited to school; they also extend into their home lives, and without adequate adult guidance, the struggles of this generation are likely to persist. Adolescence has always been a tumultuous time, but many believe that the difficulties have intensified over the years. Bullying, a longstanding issue, used to be confined to the school environment, but now, with the rise of social media, it infiltrates what should be the safe haven of home. The negative actions of peers can reach teenagers in the sanctity of their own bedrooms, leading to ongoing distress.Another concern for many young people is the pressure to succeed imposed by their families. Whether at school or in the home, they often grapple with feelings of inadequacy, leading to overwhelm and despair. While parents have the noble intention of ensuring their children start life on the right foot, many teens often feel they are letting their families down if they cannot meet those expectations. This pressure can sometimes drive them to engage in dishonest and unethical behavior, such as cheating on exams or plagiarizing classmates' work. When such actions are discovered, they can have serious repercussions on young people’s future prospects and emotional health.The role of parental support in helping young people navigate life is crucial. Parents can make a significant difference by assisting teens with building a positive body image and self-esteem, managing difficult interactions with peers, and providing academic guidance. Open discussions about concerns, active listening, and offering non-judgmental advice are effective ways for parents to help. Additionally, involving professionals, such as teachers, counselors, and coaches, can provide further assistance. Most importantly, offering unconditional love can enable children to develop into better, happier individuals.In summary, being a young person in today’s world is challenging. By coming together and paying close attention to their adolescents, families can help them overcome obstacles and pave the way for their success as adults."
1310;Tourism today creates a variety of problems, such as pollution due to flights, transport and dirty water.Do you think that governments should impose extra taxes on flights or accommodation to restrict today’s tourism industry?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Travelling today is simple to the extent that within twelve hours one can travel from Europe to Singapore, crossing nearly the whole globe. Based on this simplicity, tourism has changed significantly over the years. While in the past a family would be proud to drive two hours to a lake, many families now think nothing of travelling to the far side of the world. This also has a downside as increased pollution is a result. Extra taxes on flights or accommodation have therefore been offered as a solution so as to increase the cost of tourism and reduce its popularity.No matter what major transportation is used, travelling creates pollution. To decrease the amount of pollution caused by tourism, the tourism industry itself would have to be weakened. If these increased taxes are based on travelling distance, people would be more willing to stay closer to their home country, as for many even a slight increase would mean that their planned holidays would be too expensive. Accommodation taxes would raise holiday costs no matter the distance travelled. Therefore, if increased taxes were levied on travel and accommodation, tourism and therefore pollution would decrease.On the other hand, the main transport methods that would be impacted by imposing extra taxes would be communal ones, such as planes, trains and buses, and increasing the taxes would also impact non-tourists. Also, holidays are a vital part of ordinary people’s lives, as they escape from work and stress, and get to spend valuable time with their families. Stopping people travelling would greatly impact some simple pleasures of ordinary life.In conclusion, while tourism impacts the environment significantly, simply introducing extra taxes on transport or accommodation is a drastic measure. It could be more valuable to change the methods of transportation to decrease pollution, instead making people stay close to home.;Traveling today is remarkably easy, allowing individuals to journey from Europe to Singapore in just twelve hours, nearly circling the globe. This simplicity has transformed tourism over the years. Where families once took pride in driving two hours to a lake, many now view long-haul trips across the world as routine. However, this shift has a downside, as it contributes to increased pollution. To combat this issue, proposals for additional taxes on flights or accommodations have emerged to raise the cost of tourism and deter excessive travel.Regardless of the mode of transportation, travel generates pollution. Reducing the environmental impact of tourism may require a recalibration of the industry itself. If higher taxes are linked to travel distance, many might opt to vacation closer to home, as even a slight increase in costs could render planned holidays unaffordable. Accommodation taxes would also elevate travel expenses, regardless of distance. Thus, if travel and accommodation taxes were implemented, both tourism and pollution could see a decline.Nevertheless, the primary modes of transport affected by these increased taxes would likely be communal options like planes, trains, and buses, which could inadvertently burden non-tourists as well. Additionally, vacations play a crucial role in people's lives, providing essential relief from work and stress while allowing quality time with loved ones. Restricting travel could significantly diminish some of life's simple joys.In summary, while tourism undoubtedly impacts the environment, imposing additional taxes on transportation and accommodations may be an extreme approach. A more effective solution might involve innovating transportation methods to reduce pollution, rather than simply encouraging people to stay closer to home.
861;Traffic and housing problems could be solved by moving large companies, factories and their employees to the countryside.Do you agree or disagree?;Many metropolises are facing challenges, including traffic gams and serious lacking of housing available for families to live, particular in the developed countries. The governments are looking for a way to lessen the volume of traffic in the cities and to increase the number of housing provision over the metropolises. Some people advocate the businesses including large corporations and factories along with their employees moving to the suburbs which is the best way to figure out the metropolitan problems. Is this a sheer solution for these challenges faced by the cities?Economy boom in a country is accompanied with a number of problems incurred in the cities due to the multitudes living in there. It is no wonder that metropolises represent more job opportunities available and better education system to next generations. These are strong pull factors appealing people to stay in the cities despite the higher cost in living. A larger number of populations in the cities not only result in a severe shortage of housing where there is a higher demand of housing over the available supply, but also bring the higher volume of traffic across the cities, particular in a peak hour when a thousand and one employees commuting to work and students going to schools. Some people believe the working location shifting to rural areas is a solution that enables to lessen the frequent usage of roads in cities. Simultaneously, it is assumed that the housing issue can be solved naturally arising from the migration of their employees into the suburban town next to their working place.The business allocated to suburbs alone is rarely considered enough to tackle these problems. A place to live requires the basic facilities to serve for clothing, food, housing and transportation which are basic needs of human. If there is a working place and residential area only in the suburban town without any infrastructures, people have no choice to drive their vehicles back and forth between cities and their living places for the general consumption. As a consequence, the traffic congestion in cities will be worsen combining with the significant deterioration of air quality in the countryside due to an increase in the emission of the greenhouse gases. Therefore, the governments play a key role to establish a neighborhood which could be self-sufficient communities outside of their larger metropolitan areas. This may be a feasible and effective way to minimize the metropolitan issues.My own view is that the shifting strategies in suburbs can help lessen the challenges faced by metropolises. But the governments should take the smart planning into consideration in which the employment bases with the living infrastructures are developed in the suburban town.;Many major cities are grappling with significant challenges, such as traffic congestion and a severe shortage of housing for families, particularly in developed nations. Governments are seeking ways to reduce urban traffic and increase housing availability across these metropolises. Some propose relocating businesses, including large corporations and factories, along with their employees, to suburban areas as a potential solution to urban issues. But is this truly an effective remedy for the problems these cities face?Economic growth in a country often leads to various urban challenges due to the influx of people into cities. It's no surprise that metropolises offer abundant job opportunities and superior educational systems for future generations, which are compelling reasons for individuals to remain despite the high cost of living. This rising population not only exacerbates the housing crisis—where demand far exceeds supply—but also leads to significant traffic congestion, particularly during peak hours when thousands of employees are commuting to work and students are heading to school. Some argue that moving workplaces to rural areas could alleviate congestion on city roads. Additionally, the theory suggests that this migration would naturally address the housing shortage as workers relocate to suburban areas near their jobs.However, simply relocating businesses to the suburbs is unlikely to fully address these issues. Livable areas require essential amenities—such as access to food, clothing, housing, and transportation—to meet basic human needs. If suburban towns only consist of workplace and residential zones without proper infrastructure, residents will have no option but to travel back and forth between the cities and their homes for daily necessities. This would likely worsen urban traffic congestion while also deteriorating air quality in surrounding areas due to increased greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, governments must play a crucial role in developing self-sufficient communities outside major metropolitan areas. This approach could be a viable and effective means of mitigating the challenges faced by cities.In my opinion, relocating businesses to the suburbs can help alleviate some pressures on metropolises. However, it's essential for governments to engage in smart planning, ensuring that employment centers are developed alongside necessary infrastructure to support living in suburban towns.
1229;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;While some people argue that equal numbers of male and female students should be accepted in every major, I personally disagree with this statement.There are a number of arguments that can support my stance. To begin with, it is impossible to enroll equal genders of students in every subject. It is true that some faculties are underrepresented by a particular gender. For example, STEM subjects usually have more male students than females, but the opposite is true in educational-related subjects, which phenomenon seems to violate the principle that we fight endeavor today, gender equality. Therefore, people want to accept equal numbers of students to achieve a gender balance in every subject. However, the reality is that different genders prefer to study different subjects themselves, but not because of the unequal opportunity. According to one of the research, women show a higher interest in subjects like education, psychology and arts rather than science-related subjects. As a result, it is apparent that admitting equivalent proportions of male and female students can hardly be achieved.In addition, it will deprive students of chances to make their own choices if universities enroll both genders equally in every subject mandatorily. It should be noted that it is students' right to select the subjects freely in college. If students cannot register for the subjects they want to study just because there are not enough quotas left for particular gender of students, or they are forced to study some subjects they are not interested in just because they need to fulfill the gender requirement in the class, it will hinder students' learning in the long-run.To conclude, universities should not enroll equal gender students in every subject as it is impossible to achieve and may deprive students the freedom to choose the major they want to study.;"While some individuals advocate for equal representation of male and female students in every academic major, I respectfully disagree with this perspective. There are several points that support my position. Firstly, it is unrealistic to aim for equal gender enrollment across all disciplines. Certain fields indeed exhibit gender imbalances; for instance, STEM programs typically attract a higher proportion of male students, while education and arts-related fields tend to have more female participants. This discrepancy, while often viewed as contrary to our pursuit of gender equality, reflects inherent preferences rather than a lack of opportunity. Research indicates that women generally gravitate towards subjects like education, psychology, and the arts, rather than toward science and technology. Consequently, achieving equal representation of male and female students in every major is practically unfeasible.Moreover, enforcing equal recruitment of both genders in every discipline could restrict students' autonomy in choosing their preferred paths. Students should have the right to select their subjects freely during their college experience. If admissions policies prevent students from enrolling in the courses of their choice due to quota limitations based on gender, or compel them to pursue fields where they lack interest to meet gender requirements, it could negatively impact their motivation and learning outcomes over time.In summary, universities should refrain from mandating equal gender enrollment in all subjects, as this goal is unattainable and could compromise students' freedom to choose their desired majors."
1433;Universities should allocate the same amount of money to their sport activities as they allocate to their libraries. Do you agree or disagree?;Yes, I do feel that universities should have an equal budget for their libraries as well as sport activities. It is our general belief that a good player can not be good student and hence we restrict our children’s sport activities at college level. Moreover, an academic degree has much more value than sport activities which naturally compels students to focus more on their studies than their interest in sport.Most of the universities keep sports at of their priority list, good players do not get enough facilities and to improve their skills and eventually they their interest.Universities can play substantial role in shaping this upcoming talent by providing good trainers and which is otherwise too expensive to afford. Also it will attract other students sports and inculcate importance of physical fitness in them.Universities should produce in all fields rather than only concentrating on progress of scholars. Hence, I feel that universities should allot equal amounts of money to as well as sport activities.;I believe that universities should allocate an equal budget for their libraries and sports activities. There is a common perception that a successful athlete cannot also be a strong student, which leads us to limit college-level sports participation for our children. Additionally, an academic degree is often seen as more valuable than sports, which naturally encourages students to prioritize their studies over athletic pursuits. Many universities place sports low on their list of priorities, resulting in insufficient resources for talented athletes to enhance their skills, ultimately diminishing their interest in sports. By investing in quality trainers—services that are often too costly for individuals to afford—universities can significantly contribute to nurturing emerging talent. This support could also attract more students to engage in sports and promote the importance of physical fitness. Universities should strive to foster excellence across all fields, not just academics. Therefore, I firmly believe that an equal amount of funding should be dedicated to both academic resources and sports activities.
1387;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;Today computers are used almost everywhere, it is impossible to imagine our life without PCs, Internet, mobile phones and other computer devices. It is reasonable to think that people look forward to the future of computers., computers make our life easier, we can easily get information about any product we plan to buy or place we plan to visit in a second using a personal computer and . Scientists predict that in the nearest future it will be possible to smell a new perfume using the Internet and watch 3D scenes at home like we do in the movie theater. According to forecasts of HR agencies machines will replace jobs of cashiers, and civil and military pilots. Some corporations in Japan are already sellinghousewife-robots, which help old people to keep their homes clean.Despite the fact that computers help us, they make us dependent. Apparently, people spend more time behind monitors than ever before. And some of them feel a need for more time to be spent with people in live contact. In addition, a breakdown of one of the important modules of a specific computer can entail serious consequences. to mention the computer problem that occurred in the end of 1990s, a problem related to the coming year 2000 (Y2K) and catastrophes that were predicted. Fortunately imminent disasters did not happen. However, it is difficult to imagine what could if all the predictions came true.We live in a technological era, computers penetrated everywhere with all benefits they provide and all dangers they hide. However we are satisfied with them and sometimes we even thank them because they help us in communicating, studying, doing business, entertaining and saving lives in critical situations.;Today, computers have become ubiquitous, making it nearly impossible to envision our lives without personal computers, the Internet, mobile phones, and various other digital devices. It's only natural to anticipate the future developments in computing. Computers simplify our lives, allowing us to quickly access information about products we're considering buying or places we plan to visit. Scientists predict that soon we may be able to experience the scent of a new perfume online or enjoy 3D movie scenes in the comfort of our homes. According to forecasts from human resources agencies, machines are expected to take over the jobs of cashiers, as well as civil and military pilots. Some Japanese companies have even begun marketing robotic assistants to help elderly individuals maintain a clean household.Despite the advantages computers offer, they also foster dependency. People are spending more time than ever in front of screens, and some are expressing a desire for more face-to-face interactions. Additionally, if a key component of a computer fails, it can lead to significant issues. For example, during the late 1990s, concerns about the Year 2000 (Y2K) bug led to widespread predictions of catastrophe, which ultimately did not materialize. Nonetheless, it's somewhat unsettling to consider what might have occurred if those scenarios had come to fruition.We are living in a technological age where computers are intricately woven into the fabric of daily life, bringing with them both remarkable advantages and hidden dangers. Nevertheless, we remain largely satisfied with these machines, often expressing gratitude for their roles in enhancing communication, education, business, entertainment, and even saving lives in emergencies.
1396;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in the future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;In the last two decades cybernetics have experienced a major breakthrough .This led to the utilization of computers in nearly all parts of our daily life, from personal computers to the ones performing complicated surgeries. Surely the uptake of this technology facilitates a lot of difficult tasks but is this excessive ripping the warmth out of our lives? .Most of the daily tasks individual experiences are time and effort consuming. These two qualities could be tremendously saved by the use of computers. The average period required to prepare a decent meal for a middle-class family is around an hour to hour and a half when using traditional methods. This time could be literally reduced to half if computerized are used instead. Moreover, a busy businessman is enabled to easily close a profitable deal with just a touch highly programmed laptop while enjoying his family vacation and not having to exert an extra effort of traveling long distances in order to a deal.On the other hand, new generations are growing remarkably dependent on these modern utilities, which makes them handicapped when it comes to a cup of tea. , psychologists suggest that one of the main reasons for rate increase is the recent electric inventions. This is due to the fact that humans by nature stay emotionally healthy through socializing, but due to the importance of modern technology to maintain a financially satisfying standard of life they gradually themselves. As time passes by each of these individuals gets stuck in a vicious circle of loneliness that eventually leads to suicidal attempts especially among youngsters.In conclusion, similarly to every other invention computers have their benefits and drawbacks, I personally think it all depends upon how we use the given tools . Moderation is the key here to keep the balance and allow us to live in harmony.;Over the past two decades, cybernetics has made significant advances, leading to the integration of computers into nearly every aspect of our daily lives, from personal devices to those used in complex surgical procedures. While this technological adoption undoubtedly streamlines many challenging tasks, one might wonder if it has drained the emotional warmth from our existence. Many daily activities can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, but computers can greatly reduce the effort involved. For instance, preparing a decent meal for a middle-class family using traditional methods typically takes about an hour to an hour and a half, a time frame that could be halved with computerized assistance. Additionally, a busy executive can finalize a lucrative deal with just a few clicks on a sophisticated laptop, all while enjoying a family holiday and avoiding long-distance travel.Conversely, the younger generations are increasingly reliant on these modern conveniences, often becoming unable to perform simple tasks without assistance. Psychologists suggest that one reason for rising mental health issues is the influence of new electronic devices. Humans inherently maintain emotional well-being through social interactions, yet the pressure to leverage modern technology for financial stability can lead to social isolation. This cycle of loneliness can ultimately escalate into suicidal tendencies, particularly among young people.In conclusion, like any invention, computers come with their own set of advantages and disadvantages. I believe that the key lies in how we choose to utilize these tools. Striking a balance through moderation is essential for fostering a harmonious existence.
1356;What are the difficulties of learning a foreign language, and how to overcome them?;Many people believe that learning a foreign language is a very difficult task. What are the most difficult things about learning a foreign language? What is the best way to overcome them? Explain and include your personal experience or knowledge of these problems.It is true that acquiring new language skills is by no means an easy task. Language learners might encounter several challenges such as unfamiliar accents or grammar structures a foreign language. However, in my opinion, such difficulties can be tackled by a well-rounded education system.When it comes to languages, it is undeniably crucial to get used to a native accent and intonation for effective communication. However, picking up an accurate accent can be enormously difficult, especially for adult learners because of their lack of language learning ability. If a language learner has an unrecognisable accent and intonation, they would not be understood by native speakers. On top of that, each language has different grammar and typical grammatical sequencing of words. For example, Korean sentences always end with verbs whilst English not, which means that a Korean English-learner should the correct order of words.Despite the aforementioned difficulties, I strongly believe that everyone can master a foreign language when a couple of feasible steps are taken. Firstly, it is more important than anything to start learning a new language at a young age. By incorporating foreign language programmes in the primary school curriculum, children can easily be exposed to languages of the world and eventually acquire language skills without difficulties. Secondly, the government can financially subsidise schools to run student exchange programmes that help adolescents to get experiences abroad and make friends overseas while improving their foreign language in a way.In conclusion, I believe that individuals can have difficulties in learning a new language because of different accents and unfamiliar grammar, however, these problems can be overcome by a good quality of education system subsidised by governments.The writer covered the task by talking about some difficult aspects of learning a new language and steps to overcome them. The ideas are presented in an orderly way, their logical sequencing and the use of paragraphing make this essay easy to follow. Skillful use of linking words and expressions helps the writer maintain coherence and cohesion. Word choice needs some more attention in this essay (see suggested corrections for expressions underlined in blue), however, overall this essay seems to be worthy of IELTS Band 8.;Many individuals perceive learning a foreign language as an immensely challenging endeavor. What are the most significant obstacles in acquiring a new language, and how can one effectively overcome them? Here, I will share my insights and personal experiences regarding these challenges.It is undeniable that gaining proficiency in a new language is a complex undertaking. Language learners often face a variety of hurdles, including unfamiliar accents and intricate grammatical structures. In my view, these challenges can be effectively addressed through a comprehensive educational approach.Mastering a native accent and intonation is essential for successful communication in any language. However, achieving an authentic accent can be particularly challenging for adult learners, who may struggle with language acquisition due to reduced adaptability. A learner with a strong accent may find it difficult to be understood by native speakers. Additionally, every language showcases unique grammatical rules and word order. For instance, in Korean, sentences typically conclude with the verb, while in English, this is not the case. Thus, a Korean learner of English must become accustomed to a different sentence structure.Despite these challenges, I firmly believe that anyone can excel in a foreign language by implementing a few effective strategies. Firstly, starting language education at a young age is crucial. Incorporating foreign language programs into primary school curriculums allows children to be exposed to various languages and helps them develop language skills more easily. Secondly, governments can provide financial support to schools for student exchange programs, enabling adolescents to gain international experience and forge friendships abroad while improving their language proficiency.In summary, while individuals may encounter challenges such as diverse accents and unfamiliar grammatical rules when learning a new language, these obstacles can be surmounted with a strong educational framework supported by government investment. The essay effectively highlights key difficulties in language acquisition and suggests pragmatic solutions. The ideas are organized logically, facilitating easy comprehension. The adept use of linking words and phrases ensures coherence throughout. However, further refinement of word choice could enhance the essay's overall quality. Overall, this response demonstrates the potential to achieve an IELTS Band 8 rating.
1348;When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers (agree/disagree);When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers for people to spend their free time. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Sample EssaySome people argue that town planners should have a preference for more parks and gyms to be created than business districts and shopping malls. While I understand the concerns of people who hold this opinion, it seems to me that shopping centers are just as important as parks and gyms in a town.There are reasons why public facilities are crucial to city inhabitants. First of all, they provide suitable spaces and equipment for people to exercise. For example, people can go jogging in the park and play tennis or basketball at the sports stadium. That helps to keep their bodies fit and it also elevates their mood during the day. Besides, parks and sports facilities are good spots for people to socialize with their neighbors. People can connect with others when they are playing sports or talking casually with passers by in the park. A harmonious relationship between residents helps build a caring and friendly neighborhood.Although parks and gyms give the town dwellers all kinds of benefits, I would like to point out the importance of shopping malls to the district. Firstly, a shopping center could make shopping more convenient for the local residents. It would enable them to easily purchase things in town and transport them home with less effort and at lower cost. They would not need to spend extra money on transportation or shipping of the goods. Secondly, a shopping mall can provide employment. Locals can find work in retail, maintenance or security of the mall, hence earning an income to support their families.In conclusion, although parks and sports facilities serve as places for exercise and social activities for city dwellers, I believe that shopping centers are equally important, since they can provide job opportunities and convenience to the town residents.This essay would score well on Task Achievement because it addresses all parts of the question, discusses reasons for and against building more parks than shopping malls and expresses the opinion of the writer. The main ideas are organized well and explained coherently. The range of vocabulary is adequate for the requirements of the task response. Overall, this essay could get Band 8 in IELTS.;When planning new towns, it’s essential to prioritize the creation of public parks and sports facilities over shopping centers to provide residents with recreational spaces. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Some individuals argue that town planners should emphasize the establishment of parks and gyms rather than commercial districts and shopping malls. While I understand the reasoning behind this viewpoint, I contend that shopping centers hold equal significance alongside parks and gyms in any community.There are compelling reasons why public recreational facilities are vital for city residents. Firstly, they offer designated areas and equipment for exercise. For instance, people can jog in parks or engage in tennis and basketball at sports complexes. Such activities not only promote physical fitness but also boost overall well-being. Additionally, parks and sports facilities serve as social hubs where neighbors can interact. Casual conversations and friendly sports can foster connections among residents, cultivating a supportive and vibrant community.Despite the benefits provided by parks and gyms, it is important to recognize the value of shopping malls. Primarily, shopping centers enhance convenience for local residents, enabling easy access to goods and services without the hassle of long commutes. This convenience translates to reduced transportation costs and lower expenses overall. Furthermore, shopping malls create job opportunities for locals in various sectors such as retail, maintenance, and security, thereby providing a reliable income source to support their families.In conclusion, while parks and sports facilities play an essential role in promoting health and social interaction among residents, shopping centers are equally vital due to the convenience and employment opportunities they offer to the local population. This essay effectively addresses all aspects of the prompt, presents arguments both for and against the prioritization of parks over shopping malls, and articulates the author's perspective clearly. The organization of ideas is logical, and the use of vocabulary is appropriate for the task. Overall, this essay could achieve a Band 8 score in IELTS.
47;While many people go to university for academic study, more people should be encouraged to do vocational training because there is a lack of qualified workers such as electricians and plumbers. Do you agree or disagree?;Some believe that people should be encouraged more to study practical courses than going to university to fulfill the lack of workforce in practical areas. I agree with this proposal to some degree, because, from my knowledge, there is a lack in both fields, academic and vocational experts. Moreover, academic studies and vocational ones are equally important for every society, and not everybody can study the same thing, so both studies should be encouraged.Qualified workers and professional academics are equally needed in many parts of the world. This is because as the population grows the people's needs do it too, and this happens in all shapes and areas. While living in Argentina, I noticed the need of professionals in fields such as medicine and technology, especially robotics. In England, however, I observed the lack of plumers and carpenters. Consequently, every country needs different things.Furthermore, if strong encouragement is put on studying vocational courses only, this could be detrimental to the academic field. Essentially, both study systems are equally important. A hospital needs doctors to treat people as well as electricians to maintain the building. Besides, not everybody is good at everything. Some might be good at performing practical tasks and some good at thinking. In my family, I am the one who studied at the university, but my sister studied dressmaking. Both of us have jobs nowadays.In conclusion, I believe that the two types of studies should be stimulated. Countries worldwide are in lack of different experts, either in the vocational or academic field, hence, both workers are equally essential and needed. Besides and more importantly, not every individual can study the same subject or perform in the same area.;Some argue that there should be more encouragement for individuals to pursue practical courses instead of attending university, in order to address the shortage of skilled workers in various practical fields. I partially agree with this perspective, as I believe there is a deficit of both academic and vocational professionals. Furthermore, both academic and vocational education are essential for society, and people have different strengths and interests, so it is vital to support both paths.Qualified professionals and skilled tradespeople are needed in many parts of the world. As populations grow, so do the diverse needs of the community across various sectors. During my time in Argentina, I observed a high demand for professionals in medicine and technology, especially in robotics. Conversely, in England, I noticed a shortage of plumbers and carpenters. This highlights that different countries have varying needs.Moreover, placing too much emphasis on vocational courses alone could harm the academic sector. Both educational pathways hold equal significance. For instance, a hospital requires doctors to provide medical care, as well as electricians to ensure the facility's upkeep. Additionally, not everyone excels in the same areas. Some individuals may thrive in hands-on roles, while others may excel in theoretical thinking. In my own family, I pursued a university education, while my sister focused on dressmaking. Today, we both enjoy successful careers.In summary, I contend that both forms of education should be promoted. Different countries face shortages of experts in both vocational and academic fields, making both types of professionals vital. Moreover, it is crucial to acknowledge that individuals have unique talents and interests, and not everyone can or should pursue the same educational path.
1380;Why do criminals commit another offence after being punished?;"Many offenders commit more crimes after serving the first punishment. Why is this happening, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?It is true that some criminals commit crimes again after they have been punished. While there are several reasons for this alarming trend, some effective measures can be taken by governments to tackle this problem.There are two main reasons for re-offenders. Firstly, the prison system can make the situation worse. Criminals put together in prison and they make friends with other offenders. While they are locked up in prison, they do not have much to do there, and they would exchange information about what they have done before they came to the prison or they may plan crimes with other inmates. Secondly, offenders often do not have any other means of earning money. They are poor, uneducated and lacking skills needed to maintain a job. Also, a criminal record makes finding a job difficult as people usually avoid hiring .To solve this problem, governments should focus on rehabilitation of criminals rather than punishment. Above all, prisons need vocational training which inmates to prepare for life outside the prison. They can learn practical skills such as computer programming, car maintenance and graphic design. In this way, they can be hired for a position that requires this certain knowledge and skills. Community service is another way to reform offenders. Rather than being locked up in prison with other inmates, offenders can help society and become useful to their local community, and these activities would eliminate the negative influence that prisons can have.In conclusion, it is true the one of the problems our community; it can be solved by focusing rather than punishment itself.This is a good essay. The requirements of the task statement are covered, the reasoning is logical and presented in a coherent, easy to follow way, the range of vocabulary is wide enough and the writer shows fluency and flexibility. Some minor errors in this essay include word choice and preposition errors (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows suggested corrections). Overall this looks like an IELTS Band 8 essay.";Many offenders tend to re-offend after completing their initial punishment. This raises the question: why does this occur, and what steps can be taken to address this issue? It is indeed the case that some individuals engage in criminal activities again following their sentences. While various factors contribute to this concerning trend, governments can implement effective strategies to combat the problem.Two primary reasons contribute to recidivism. First, the prison environment may exacerbate the situation. Inmates often form connections with fellow offenders, and the lack of activities during their incarceration allows them to share experiences related to their past crimes or even plot new ones. Second, many offenders lack viable means of earning an income. They often come from disadvantaged backgrounds, are uneducated, and do not possess the skills necessary for securing employment. Moreover, having a criminal record makes it challenging to find jobs, as employers are frequently reluctant to hire individuals with such backgrounds.To address this issue, governments should prioritize the rehabilitation of criminals rather than solely focusing on punishment. One crucial step involves providing vocational training within prisons to equip inmates with the skills they need for successful reintegration into society. By offering courses in practical areas such as computer programming, car maintenance, and graphic design, inmates can acquire valuable knowledge and experience that will make them more employable. Additionally, community service programs can serve as a means of reforming offenders. Instead of being incarcerated with other criminals, they can engage in activities that benefit society and contribute positively to their local communities, thereby mitigating the negative influences that can arise within the prison system.In conclusion, recidivism is a significant problem facing our communities, but it can be effectively addressed by shifting the focus from punishment to rehabilitation. This essay meets the requirements of the task statement, presenting logical reasoning in a coherent and easily understood manner. The vocabulary used is diverse, and the writer demonstrates fluency and adaptability. While there are minor errors related to word choice and prepositions, the overall composition resembles an IELTS Band 8 essay.
1400;With all the problems in the world today, spending money on space exploration is a complete waste. The money could be better spent on other causes.;, every day, every year, celebrates its achievements in space exploration. However, it is now the time to question how meaningful these blasts are.First, until all urgent and important matters of the globe have been solved, money on space exploration is meaningless. It at all to invest millions of dollars researching and producing foods for astronauts (for space exploration purpose), while every day thousands of people are starving. Furthermore, the discovery of outer space only serves a minor group of people if the majority well-educated. do no even know how to prevent common threatening diseases such as AIDS and lung cancer.Then, some may argue that the purpose of space exploration to discover new lands, new energy resources or to deter potential threat to . Nevertheless, is it effective to do so while other alternatives are available? yet effectively used. New energy resources (e.g. solar and nuclear energy) have not yet been widely-used. Threats of plagues have not yet been deterred. All of these tasks that haven’t been tackled yet require money. That is why costly space discovery programs are a waste of resources.In a nutshell, people should only invest in space exploration provided that urgent and important matters mentioned earlier in this essay have been solved. Also, purposes of space exploration campaigns should be studied carefully and other alternatives should be considered before the money is wasted.;Every day, year after year, we celebrate the achievements in space exploration. However, it's important to pause and question the significance of these endeavors. Firstly, until we address the urgent issues facing our planet, spending money on space exploration seems frivolous. It's difficult to justify investing millions of dollars in research and development for astronaut food when thousands of people are starving daily. Moreover, space discoveries primarily benefit a select few, while the majority of well-educated individuals remain unaware of how to prevent prevalent and life-threatening diseases like AIDS and lung cancer.Some proponents may insist that the goal of space exploration is to uncover new territories, discover new energy sources, or prevent potential threats. However, one must ask if these objectives are worthwhile when there are effective alternatives available. For instance, renewable energy sources, such as solar and nuclear power, have yet to be fully utilized, and public health threats have not been sufficiently addressed. These pressing issues require financial resources, which is why costly space exploration programs may be seen as a misallocation of funds.In summary, investments in space exploration should only occur once we've resolved the urgent problems outlined earlier in this essay. Additionally, the goals of space exploration initiatives need to be thoroughly evaluated, and alternative solutions should be considered before resources are spent.
1312;With the increase in computer use, many people feel that schools do not need to put the emphasis that they used to on basic handwriting skills or mental mathematics skills.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;In recent years, computer use around the world has increased drastically. As a result technological equipment is used increasingly in schools around the world. Many people question therefore whether schools should put much emphasis on teaching students basic handwriting skills and mental mathematics skills.The use of technological equipment in lessons has increased since the onset of the digital age. Nearly all professions around the world involve computer use and even the simplest tasks are carried out via electronic equipment. Hence, it is important for students to learn how to use technology correctly for their future careers. Electronic devices also offer various learning advantages, as notes and assignments can be completed much faster and more neatly using these tools.Nonetheless, the practical skills such as using and holding a pen correctly are likewise vital for future careers. For that reason, students have to be taught at early ages how to carry out simple tasks using basic skills, such as writing. It is also essential that a student develops neat handwriting, as in the case of a technological problem the student will have to write by hand. Furthermore, final exams are typically written by hand and thus the student must develop the basic skill of holding a pen and writing with it. Mathematics skills are no different. People will not always have a device with them to carry out calculations and the ability to do arithmetic in the head is a vital skill for operating in today’s world.In conclusion, I personally believe that schools should keep a balance between using practical skills and using electronic equipment to carry out certain tasks by having student submit assignments created electronically, yet also by having them complete assignments by hand in class and without computers or calculators. This balance is important, as if the focus lies only on one of the two aspects, the student will face problems later on in life.;"In recent years, the global usage of computers has surged significantly, leading to an increased incorporation of technological tools in schools worldwide. This shift raises a critical question about whether educational institutions should prioritize teaching students fundamental handwriting skills and mental math abilities. The rise of technology in the classroom has been a hallmark of the digital era; virtually every profession now requires the use of computers, and even basic tasks often rely on electronic devices. Thus, it's imperative for students to learn to navigate technology effectively for their future careers. Moreover, electronic tools provide distinct advantages in learning, allowing students to complete notes and assignments more quickly and neatly. However, practical skills, such as the proper use of a pen, remain equally important for career readiness. Therefore, it is essential for students to be instructed from a young age on how to perform basic tasks, like writing. Developing neat handwriting is particularly crucial, as students may encounter situations where they need to write by hand—especially in cases of technological failures. Additionally, final exams are usually handwritten, thus emphasizing the need for students to master the skill of writing. The same logic applies to mathematics; individuals won't always have access to devices for calculations, making mental arithmetic an essential skill in today's world. In conclusion, I believe that schools should strive for a balance between practical skills and electronic tools. This could involve having students submit assignments electronically while also requiring them to complete tasks by hand during class, without laptops or calculators. This balanced approach is vital; an excessive focus on either practical skills or technology could lead to challenges for students later in life."
1303;With the scale of globalisation today, it would be of unquestioned benefit to have a single world currency.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Globalisation has become a significant aspect of the world’s modern economy, with countless industries and businesses expanding in various countries. This has led to the debate of developing a world currency with many people believing it could drastically help further develop economies and assist in the development of many countries.A worldwide currency could bring on effects similar to when Euro was developed for Europe. Trade could be significantly encouraged, as there would be no exchange rate fluctuation risks between different currencies. Moreover, tourists would not need to exchange money when travelling.However, there are certain risks to a global currency, which definitely do not make it an “unquestioned benefit”. Countries in debt would not be able to lower their currency value to make consumer goods more desirable, which could develop into a severe economic issue. For example, the US regulated its interest rates to increase the money resources in order to diminish the effect of a recent recession. Also economic problems, such as in Greece, have actually been made worse by the use of the common Euro. If applied worldwide, many countries’ economies could be very similarly negatively impacted. Finally, many countries around the world do not have a stable enough economy to be able to enter a common currency. If weaker countries were to adopt a world currency, this could be disastrous to their economy and to the economies of other countries using the same currency.In conclusion, the extent to which a global currency would be beneficial is quite low. It seems to me that the risks outweigh the benefits, as if a country were to lose economic stability, the world would be impacted as well. For that reason, I feel that in present circumstances, it is best to have separate currencies to protect countries from economic recession.;Globalization has become a crucial element of today’s economy, with numerous industries and businesses operating across borders. This has sparked discussions about the creation of a global currency, with many arguing that it could significantly boost economic development and aid various nations. A universal currency might produce effects similar to those seen with the introduction of the Euro in Europe, potentially streamlining trade by eliminating exchange rate fluctuations. Additionally, tourists would benefit by not needing to convert currency while traveling.However, a global currency comes with considerable risks that challenge its status as an unequivocal advantage. Nations burdened by debt would lose the ability to devalue their currency to make their goods more appealing, potentially leading to severe economic consequences. For instance, the United States adjusted its interest rates to increase money supply and mitigate the effects of a recent recession. Moreover, economic crises in countries like Greece have been exacerbated by their adoption of the Euro. If a global currency were implemented, many nations might face similar adverse effects on their economies. Furthermore, many countries lack the economic stability necessary to transition to a shared currency. For weaker economies, adopting a global currency could spell disaster, impacting not only their own financial systems but also those of other nations using the same currency.In summary, the likelihood that a global currency would be advantageous appears minimal. The associated risks seem to outweigh the potential benefits, as the economic instability of one country could reverberate throughout the world. Therefore, I believe that, under current conditions, maintaining separate currencies is the best way to safeguard countries from economic downturns.
1295;With the vast increase in online resources today, libraries with print books are not a necessity for today’s society.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is indeed true that digital resources today far outstrip what can be put and stored in print books. Almost any kind of book can now be accessed digitally and those that can’t be will soon be changed to a digital format. Some people, therefore, believe that libraries with print books are no longer needed.If one looks at this issue dispassionately, it seems far more logical that people now should only read books digitally. It only requires a single computer or electronic reader and an individual can have access to the history of literature and works on all other fields. The costs involved with setting, typing, printing and distributing print books would practically disappear and this would make things more convenient and much cheaper. An actual library building would be totally unnecessary, as all one would need would be a ‘virtual library’ as a website and all works could be accessed through this portal. There would not even be any need to leave the house to gain access to anything one needed. This would seem to be the most logical way of proceeding.Logic, however, is not always the best approach to everything. Print books have a long history with humanity and our relationship with real books is not something that can be changed overnight. Many people, including younger readers, feel that there is something special about having a book with real paper and needing to turn pages. There will therefore for the time being be a future for print books and libraries.Libraries will continue to be especially important, as not all older people use computers and e-readers as much as the younger generation. They will still want to read print books and the library is a cheap and convenient place to find them. In addition, if only a few books in print are available in the future, libraries might be one of the few places where they might be accessed. Another purpose that libraries serve is acting as community centres that organise events, education and childcare. Ironically, libraries also provide computers and Internet access for people who cannot afford their own.In spite of the seeming dominance to come of digital books, I feel that there is and will be a place for libraries with print books. This state of affairs might change in the future, but at present, they are important community resources.;"It is undeniably true that today's digital resources far surpass what can be published and stored in traditional print books. Almost any type of book can now be accessed in a digital format, and those that aren’t will likely transition soon. As a result, some individuals argue that libraries filled with print volumes have become obsolete. When examining this issue objectively, one could conclude that reading solely in digital formats is more logical. With just one computer or e-reader, a person can access a vast array of literary works across all subject areas. The expenses associated with setting up, typesetting, printing, and distributing physical books would virtually vanish, making reading more convenient and cost-effective. This would render physical library buildings unnecessary; a “virtual library” as a website could serve as a portal through which all literature can be accessed, allowing readers to stay home and find everything they need.However, logic alone doesn’t capture the entirety of the situation. Print books have deep roots in human history, and our connection to physical books isn’t something that can change overnight. Many people, including younger audiences, cherish the experience of holding a paper book and the act of turning its pages. Therefore, for the foreseeable future, print books and libraries will continue to play a significant role.Libraries will remain crucial, particularly since not all older individuals are as adept with computers and e-readers as the younger generation. They will still seek out print books, and libraries provide an affordable and convenient means to access them. Furthermore, if print books become limited in availability, libraries may be one of the few places where they can still be found. Additionally, libraries function as community hubs that host events, educational programs, and childcare services. Ironically, they also offer computers and internet access to those who cannot afford their own.Despite the anticipated rise of digital books, I believe there will always be a place for libraries housing print books. While this situation may evolve in the future, at present, libraries serve as vital community resources."
1392;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Capital punishment is always associated with ignorance and intolerance. In fact, we must acknowledge that some people disagree with this kind of penalty, but others vote in its favor. Portugal was the first European country to end this kind of penalty. Since the 19th century, tolerance and respect for life important values. Moreover, we can affirm that remains under the same codes. Maybe because of a religious view point, the respect for life is a typical value in the Old Catholic world.Those who are in favor of capital punishment mostly live in developing countries. However, this is not just an image of the Third World countries. Actually, the USA is one country where this kind of punishment has its rates of application. The state of Texas, in particular, is at the top, supporting this measure against crime, especially those involving serial killers and crimes against children. In a society dominated by fear and government control, it is foreseen that this penalty will continue .Maybe this is not a simple question. As we can see there are several values here and of course cultural behavior. The roots of the question are religious, cultural, ethical and even geographical. The world is divided and the law systems show this division. The solutions, however can lead us to other questions concerning revenge and justice. better to kill a person because of his crimes? Can we admit that a life sentence could be a much better sentence? In fact, rehabilitation is the right way especially with an accurate psychological evaluation first. Some people are lost forever, and in my opinion some murderers and other criminals will suffer more in jail. In this sense, capital punishment is an easy way out.;Capital punishment is often linked to ignorance and intolerance. While some individuals support this form of punishment, there are many who oppose it. Notably, Portugal was the first European nation to abolish the death penalty. Since the 19th century, values such as tolerance and respect for life have gained importance. Furthermore, it can be asserted that these principles persist within contemporary laws. Respect for life is a deeply rooted value, particularly within the Old Catholic tradition, which may stem from religious beliefs. Supporters of capital punishment are predominantly found in developing countries, but it's essential to recognize that this issue is not confined to the so-called Third World. For instance, the United States is a notable example where the death penalty is still practiced, with Texas being a leading state in its application, particularly for severe crimes such as serial killings and offenses against children. In a society marked by fear and government oversight, it seems likely that capital punishment will continue to be used. This complex issue involves various values and cultural behaviors, with roots that span religious, cultural, ethical, and geographical dimensions. The world is divided on this topic, and the legal systems reflect that divergence. However, the discussions around it often raise further questions about revenge and justice. Is it justifiable to take a life in response to a crime? Could a life sentence serve as a more humane alternative? Rehabilitation, particularly when guided by thorough psychological assessments, is a preferable approach. While some individuals may seem irredeemable, it is my belief that certain murderers and criminals endure greater suffering within the prison system. In this context, capital punishment appears to be an expedient solution rather than a just one.
1430;Without capital punishment our lives are less secure and crimes or violence increase. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Serious crimes need capital punishment so that the are unable to get involved in the crime in the future. However, they want to stop the acts of violation in the future then it would be better to .Overall, I agree with the fact that punishment is the way to avoid the and hence our lives become more secure. If the wrongdoer wants to be a good and there is a particular financial or personal problem that led him to the wrong way, then it would be the nice option to forgive him and try to solve the problem he . Although by this way, some bad may become effective of the society but some do not bring themselves to the right path because they are . The person that involved in the crime and never to stop the law-breaking act should be punished in extremely serious way. However, it totally depends on the nature of crime. Some to a capital punishment and some may require a small penalty. The law-making institutions are responsible to bring the bad man to the right level of punishment that he deserves. If there is weak legislation to properly handle the offender, it may for the good . The government should be the responsible authority to provide a secure and better state to live. Laws should be implemented and executed in the most proper way that not allow the offender to commit violent acts or to break the law in any way and to any extent. To sum up, it is the responsibility of the state to stop people involved in crime. It may be done through solving the problems of the people that led them to commit that act or by the punishment accordingly.Where are the paragraphs? This is a good essay; however there are many small mistakes that might cost you dearly. There are also several unclear expressions and grammatical errors.";Serious crimes warrant capital punishment to prevent offenders from repeating their actions in the future. However, if the goal is to reduce violations, a more effective solution could be implemented. Overall, I believe that appropriate punishment is essential in creating a safer society. If a wrongdoer genuinely wishes to reform and their criminal behavior stems from financial or personal issues, it may be beneficial to show compassion, help address their problems, and offer forgiveness.While this approach can lead to some offenders positively integrating into society, others may not change due to deeper-rooted issues. Those who repeatedly engage in criminal activity without any intention of reform should face strict consequences. The severity of the punishment should be determined by the nature of the crime committed—some may merit capital punishment, while others might warrant lighter penalties.It is the responsibility of lawmakers to ensure that justice is served appropriately, matching the severity of the crime with the right level of punishment. Weak legislation can undermine efforts to rehabilitate offenders, ultimately harming society. The government must act as the authority that guarantees a secure environment for its citizens. Laws should be enforced effectively to deter offenders from engaging in any form of violence or lawbreaking.In conclusion, the state has a duty to combat crime, whether through addressing the underlying issues that lead individuals to commit offenses or by administering appropriate punishment.
163;Write about the following topic.Although there are a lot of translation software available, learning a language could still be advantageous. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people claim that language knowledge has still benefited inspite of appearance of applications and websites providing translation in real time. Modern special software is able to give quite quality translation into different languages, and it seems that it will soon replace the translators and will get rid of necessity to learn new languages. However, in my opinion, there are still some essential advantages to know foreign languages.First of all, any language is so complicated and constantly changing system that it is impossible to automized translation process to keep all senses. For instance, if you interlocutor creates a joke based on words game, it will unlikely recognise by AI. Thus, it is too hard to teach a computer to uderstand all meanings that you want to provide.Another important aspect of learning languages is knowing new cultures. Language is the great source for understanding other nations and countries. If you use online translator, you will never know the origine of some idioms or phrases that contain culture code.Moreover, learning new language is a tool of training your brain. It helps to develop memory and imagination. For instance, people didn't refuse studying maths after calculation device had been invented, because it is still important to understand how it works and it is necessary for developing other sciences.Finally, there is a lot of places and occasions when you do not have internet access. Then online translators are not available. But if you need help or ask a path being abroad, it is better to know at least some phrases. Otherwise, you can occur in unpleasant situation.To sum up, I definitely agree the statement that learning languages is essential in spite of techology progress. Although artificial intelligence is able to translate everything you want, it is crucial to continue learning languages in order to understand all sense and meanings in conversation with foreigners, to know new cultures and understand their peculiarities and, of course, to make your brain work.;"Some individuals argue that knowledge of languages remains advantageous despite the emergence of applications and websites that provide real-time translation. While modern software can deliver fairly accurate translations in various languages, it seems likely that these tools could eventually replace human translators and eliminate the need to learn new languages. However, I believe there are still significant benefits to knowing foreign languages.First and foremost, language is an intricate and continually evolving system, making it impossible for automated translation processes to capture all nuances. For example, if your conversation partner makes a joke based on a play on words, it is unlikely that an AI would recognize it. Consequently, teaching a machine to grasp every intended meaning is a daunting challenge.Additionally, learning a language opens the door to understanding different cultures. Language serves as a vital source of insight into the customs and values of other nations. When you rely on an online translator, you miss out on the origins of idioms and phrases that are rich with cultural significance.Moreover, acquiring a new language is an effective way to exercise your brain. It enhances memory and stimulates imagination. For instance, people didn't stop studying mathematics after calculators were invented; understanding the principles behind calculations remains crucial for other scientific fields.Finally, there are numerous situations where internet access may be unavailable, rendering online translators useless. In such cases, being able to communicate at least a few phrases can be invaluable, especially when navigating a foreign environment. Without this ability, you may find yourself in uncomfortable situations.In conclusion, I firmly support the idea that learning languages is essential, regardless of technological advancements. Although artificial intelligence can translate a wide range of text, it is vital to continue learning languages to fully grasp the nuances of conversations with foreigners, gain insights into diverse cultures, and keep your mind sharp."

Why are more people choosing to have operation to change the way they look? Do you think this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;A greater number of individuals opted for plastic surgery to enhance the physical outlook. What could be the reason behind the increasing number of people opting for cosmetic surgery to deter their appearance.In my opinion the main reason why cosmetic surgery is in demand nowadays is because society has set a certain standard that physical appearance will be the fastest ticket to stand out in the crowd. Second is it boosts confidence to people with low self esteem.The favorable outcome is not as much the adverse effect to the individuals. Example, the fastest way to reduce wrinkles on the face is to get Botox treatment. It lasts 3-4 months, after that it needs continuous medication to maintain what has been changed. It takes a lot of money to satisfy the demands of the society. On top of that repetition of pain and recovery during and after the surgery.There are numerous natural ways to enhance beauty and confidence. Contentment, exercise and a healthy lifestyle are effective methods to maintain the genuine beauty of the people. Simple walking in the morning, keeping the distance from negativity and eating vegetables and fruits are the simplest methods that boost the natural glow of the body and prevent us from being sick.To conclude the essay, I think plastic surgery is not necessary to enhance physical outlook as it uses synthetic components that have harmful effects within the body.;An increasing number of people are choosing plastic surgery to improve their appearance. What might be driving this trend toward cosmetic procedures aimed at altering one's looks? In my view, the primary factor contributing to the rising demand for cosmetic surgery is the societal pressure to conform to specific beauty standards that suggest physical appearance is the quickest way to stand out. Additionally, these procedures can significantly boost the confidence of individuals who struggle with low self-esteem.While there are positive outcomes, the drawbacks for individuals can also be considerable. For example, Botox is a popular method for reducing facial wrinkles, but it only lasts three to four months, necessitating ongoing treatments to maintain results. This can be quite expensive and entails repeated pain and recovery associated with the procedures.There are many natural ways to enhance beauty and confidence without resorting to surgery. Practices such as contentment, regular exercise, and a healthy lifestyle can all effectively preserve one’s natural beauty. Simple activities like morning walks, distancing oneself from negativity, and maintaining a nutritious diet rich in fruits and vegetables can enhance one’s natural glow and promote overall well-being.In conclusion, I believe that plastic surgery is not essential for improving physical appearance, as it often involves synthetic materials that can have harmful effects on the body.

What solutions can you suggest?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Most children are facing one form of bullying or the other in our schools on daily basis world wide. It is becoming a serious problem and there is a need to solve this. In this essay, we would be considering two causes and possible ways to solve these.First of all, the rate at which children bullying each other in the school environment is rising. One major cause is that bullying breeds bullying, children who are faced with physical, mental and emotional abuse from homes tend to transfer their fustrations on their peers. They think that is how one is supposed to live, exacting authority to gain superiority on weaker peers in school. Another is children who has low self esteem, such students feels threatened over their classmates they taught to be more intelligent or having better physical appearance than them.Although, there are several causes of bullying, teachers should be taught how to identify children who are from abusive homes and inform the appropriate authority. These students would taken away from such toxic environment early and they would be sent for some pschological therapy. Meanwhile, education is also a key factor especially for children who have low self esteem. This should be done by forms such as role plays, presentation and drama, where these students are taught how to have self love and accepting what they can not change on their self.In conclusion, children from abusive homes and those who have low self esteem are some of the reasons for bullying. I recommend that early identification of abusive children and education is some of the ways we can solve these problems.;Bullying has become a prevalent issue in schools around the world, affecting most children on a daily basis. This growing concern necessitates immediate attention and action. In this essay, we will explore two primary causes of bullying and discuss potential solutions.To begin with, the incidence of bullying among schoolchildren is increasing. One significant factor contributing to this trend is the cycle of abuse, where children who suffer from physical, emotional, or mental mistreatment at home often direct their frustrations towards their peers. They may perceive this behavior as a means to exert control and establish dominance over weaker classmates. Another contributing factor is low self-esteem. Students who feel insecure often see their peers as threats, particularly if they believe others are more intelligent or physically attractive.While there are numerous causes of bullying, it is crucial to educate teachers on how to recognize students from abusive backgrounds and to communicate these observations to the appropriate authorities. These at-risk students should be removed from toxic environments as early as possible and provided with psychological support. In addition, educational programs targeting self-esteem are essential for those who struggle with self-image. This can be achieved through methods such as role-playing, presentations, and drama, which can help these students develop self-love and acceptance of their unique qualities.In summary, the cycle of bullying is often fueled by children from abusive homes and those who experience low self-esteem. Early identification of at-risk students and targeted educational initiatives can play a pivotal role in addressing and mitigating these issues.

However, it comes with both advantages and disadvantages.One of the main advantages of online shopping is the convenience it offers.

For instance, orders can be delayed, and items may arrive when you're not at home or when you're too tired to receive them. Additionally, there are instances of incorrect orders where you receive something different from what you originally requested. Furthermore, the quality and color of products can vary significantly from what is displayed on the website, leading to disappointment when the item arrives.In conclusion, I believe that if you choose to shop online, it's important to ensure that the website is reputable and secure to avoid potential scams. On the other hand, shopping at physical stores tends to be more comfortable and safe.
515;Write about the following topic.Cohabitation is believed to bring huge advantages for young people since it enables them to fully understand each other before deciding to get married.Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many people believe it may be advisable for couples to live together before getting married, as it may lead to a smoother relationship after they have married.I tend to agree with such opinions, as I find the arguments that usually support them to be quite reasonable. For example, it is commonly said that people act differently when they are at home and when they are outside. People instinctively tend to be more relaxed and off-guard when at home, whereas in social situations they usually make an effort, even if unconsciously, to be more likable and to conceal the less agreeable aspects of their personality from others, even their partners. Because of this, it is usual to hear that one does not truly know someone until one has lived with that person.In extreme cases, cohabitation before marriage could even prevent couples from entering into a marriage that is bound to fail and will lead to unhappiness. Considering this possibility seems reasonable, as marriage is not only an emotional bond, but also a legal one, and undoing it is usually upsetting, time-consuming and costly.Another reason I find cohabitation before marriage to be a sensible choice is that, as minor disagreements and conflicts are usually inevitable during the first months of cohabitation, it is preferable to pass through that stage before getting married than to add such problems to a period which in itself can already be stressful, such as the few weeks before the ceremony and the weeks following.What I have said up to this point reflects my opinion, but it must be noted I did not put any of it into practice when I got married. Indeed, my wife and I decided to move in together only a few weeks before the ceremony. This decision was due to the fact that her family is quite old-fashioned, and moving in together before would undoubtedly have caused them pain, even if we had our reasons for doing so and they would have understood them. No degree of persuasion would have avoided or removed such pain. We found the long-term benefits of a stable and close relationship with her family to be more important than the discomfort of not moving in together, and we ultimately decided to do it only once the ceremony was planned.;"Many believe that it is wise for couples to cohabitate before marriage, as this could lead to a more harmonious relationship post-wedding. I tend to share this viewpoint, as the arguments supporting this idea appear quite logical. For instance, it is often said that individuals behave differently at home compared to social settings. At home, people tend to be more relaxed and authentic, while in public, they generally strive to be more appealing, often concealing less favorable traits, even from their partners. As such, it is common belief that one doesn't truly get to know someone until they’ve lived together.In some cases, living together before marriage could even prevent couples from entering into a union that is likely to end in disappointment and unhappiness. This is a valid consideration, since marriage involves not only an emotional connection but also a legal commitment, and the process of untangling it can be emotionally taxing, time-consuming, and costly.Additionally, I view cohabitation prior to marriage as a practical decision, particularly because minor disagreements and conflicts are often unavoidable during the initial months of sharing a space. Navigating these challenges before the wedding is preferable to having them arise during what can already be a stressful time, such as the weeks leading up to the ceremony and immediately after.While this encapsulates my perspective, I must acknowledge that my own experience did not align with this practice. My wife and I chose to move in together only a few weeks before our wedding. This decision was influenced by her traditional family, who would have disapproved of us cohabitating beforehand, despite our valid reasons. We recognized that no amount of persuasion could alleviate their potential pain. Ultimately, we determined that maintaining a strong, long-term relationship with her family was more important than our discomfort over not living together prior to the ceremony; thus, we waited until our plans were in place to take that step."

What measures can be taken to protect them?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;These days, consumers often suffer from the increase of numbers of advertisements conducted by competing companies. I believe that this fact has certain negative effects on consumers' working performance as well as their private space and time. In order to protect consumers, some proposals related to protecting their information and eliminating the number of advertisements are required.The increasing number of advertisements has a negative effect on the consumers. Firstly, their working perfomance can be reduced. Obivously, when a person is working, he cannot receive a large number of advertisements, process and response them. I know a researcher who receives a lot of advertising emails from certain banksand even some scientific journal while he require time to perform many research projects. This makes him feel uncomfortable when working, thereby reducing the research's quality. Secondly, the advertisements can affect on people private space and time. For examle, when they spend time on their family after a hard working day, or even when they are sleeping. This completyly affects on the consumers, in terms of both physical and mental health.For protecting consumers, certain methods need to be proposed. Firstly, it can be implied that the consumers' information is illegal used by many companies. Therefore, an imporvement of security method can allow us to protect consumers. Secondly, eliminating the number of advertisements performed by companies and eliminating the hours for companies send advertisements are required.In conclusion, the increasing numbers of advertisements leads to certain unwanted results for consumers, such as reducing their working performance as well as their private space and time. For protecting consumers, we need to protect their personal information and eliminate the number of advertisements.;Nowadays, consumers frequently find themselves overwhelmed by the sheer volume of advertisements from competing companies. I believe this phenomenon has negative repercussions for both consumers' productivity and their personal time. To safeguard consumers, it's essential to implement measures aimed at protecting their data and reducing the number of advertisements they encounter.The rising tide of advertisements adversely impacts consumers. Firstly, it can diminish their work performance. Clearly, when individuals are focused on their tasks, they struggle to manage and respond to the influx of advertisements. I know a researcher who receives numerous promotional emails from various banks and even academic journals, which detracts from his time spent on crucial research projects. This constant interruption leaves him feeling unsettled, ultimately compromising the quality of his work. Secondly, advertisements intrude upon individuals' personal time and space. For example, they can interrupt family moments after a long day of work or even disrupt sleep. This relentless bombardment affects consumers' overall well-being, both physically and mentally.To protect consumers, we need to propose certain actions. Firstly, many companies misuse consumers' information without consent. Therefore, enhancing security measures is vital to safeguard consumers’ data. Secondly, it is necessary to limit the quantity of advertisements companies are allowed to deploy and restrict the times they can send them.In conclusion, the increasing volume of advertisements leads to several undesirable outcomes for consumers, including diminished productivity and intrusions into their personal lives. To protect consumers, we must prioritize the safeguarding of their personal information and work toward reducing the number of advertisements they encounter.

However, recently when I dropped by there I surprised with new tall building that newly built. My cusion told me once the big supermarkert open in this neighborhood, grasp many couples or familly to live here.

I considered it is anachromism idea. Now the customer's purchasing value is totally diffrent with previous eras. Buyer start choose organic product and eco-friendlly or morality brand. If local stores have their own unique products, which are not replace with other, such as handmade cheese and unique taste of bread, local bussiness can compete with global chain markets.In conclusion, albeit famous company expands their sites every moments, the local community can be larger by new residents settled down near local region. Also, local bussiness have specialty, community can not dismissed;"As large companies expand their operations, local markets often face challenges within their communities. However, I believe that the closure of local businesses does not necessarily lead to the decline of local communities; in fact, it can have the opposite effect. This essay will elaborate on my viewpoint, supported by relevant examples.Firstly, big companies often attract new residents. I contend that major corporations can help local communities thrive. For instance, my cousin has lived in the countryside for 30 years. During my visits, I noticed that the farmland had remained largely unchanged over the decades. However, during a recent visit, I was surprised to see new tall buildings that had been constructed. My cousin explained that when a large supermarket opened nearby, it drew many couples and families to the area. As a result, the rural population increased significantly.Some may argue that the low prices offered by large grocery chains undermine local products, leading to the closure of small businesses. I believe this perspective is outdated. Today’s consumers have different purchasing priorities than in the past. Many buyers are now opting for organic, eco-friendly, or ethically sourced products. If local stores focus on offering unique items that cannot easily be replaced, such as artisanal cheeses or distinctive baked goods, they can effectively compete with global retail chains.In conclusion, while well-known companies continue to expand their presence, local communities can actually grow as new residents move in. Furthermore, local businesses have their own distinctive qualities that cannot be overlooked."

479;Write about the following topic.Few people devote time to hobbies nowadays. Say why you think this is the case and what effect this has on the individual and society in general.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Hobbies are recreational activities that are pursued away from one's school or work. They are meant to be an escape from the mundane and a way of keeping people sane and happy. Unfortunately, they have become almost a luxury in today's fast-paced world.Several reasons can account for this massive decrease in the pursuit of hobbies. One such reason is the fact that hobbies require time and money which are two very dear resources in today's world. Social sophistication and technological advancements have brought about changes in hobbies. What used to be called hobbies in the past are now considered obsolete and the new ones, including video games and virtual reality require financial commitment in their pursuit. Even if one has the money to pursue such, he or she would have to set aside time in his or her busy schedule to enjoy those hobbies. It is therefore no wonder that most people found to pursue hobbies today are either wealthy youth or comfortable pensioners.Secondly, lack of interest may be an important factor why people devote little to no time to hobbies. Most of the educated lot are taught from a tender age only to concentrate on their studies in order to secure a comfortable future for themselves. Such children are discouraged from enjoying anything away from anything extracurricular and therefore grow into hobby-less adults who work all day and do nothing else otherwise. This is seen in a lot of Ghanaian homes where doing anything other than studying after school is deemed a taboo. Consequently, many grow into adults with little humour or mirth.Moreover, many people get exhausted with school or work, which have become extremely intensive nowadays, as compared to the more laid back past. After a tiring day, most people like to crawl into their beds to catch a night-long rest only to return to their busy life the next day.This lack of hobby pursuit, though understandable, does the individual and society more harm than good. Many individuals today are being treated for one mental health or another. Hobbies are a good way to relax and destress through leisure and can go a long way to improve mental health. Its absence will only wreak havoc for the society, which will only consist of tired and apathetic individuals who could not care less about each other and their surroundings.In conclusion, it is important, albeit difficult, to pay attention to hobbies in order to improve the health and psyche of the individual and society as a whole. More effort should be geared at encouraging hobbies at school and at the work place.;Hobbies are recreational activities that people engage in outside of their academic or professional commitments. They serve as a means to escape the routine of daily life, fostering happiness and mental well-being. Sadly, in today’s fast-paced society, pursuing hobbies has come to be viewed as a luxury.Several factors contribute to the significant decline in hobby engagement. One key reason is that hobbies often require both time and money—two invaluable resources that are hard to come by in modern life. Advances in technology and societal changes have transformed traditional hobbies into what may now seem outdated. New hobbies, such as video gaming and virtual reality, often demand a financial investment. Even for those who can afford these pastimes, finding the time amidst a busy schedule can be challenging. As a result, it is not surprising that most individuals actively pursuing hobbies today tend to be either affluent young adults or comfortable retirees.Another factor may be a lack of interest, stemming from early education. Many children are conditioned to focus solely on their studies, with little encouragement to explore extracurricular activities. This can lead to a future where they grow into adults who lack hobbies, spending long hours at work without any leisure pursuits. This is particularly evident in many Ghanaian households, where engaging in activities beyond studying is often frowned upon. Consequently, many adults emerge from this environment without a sense of humor or joy.Additionally, the intensity of modern schooling and the demands of work can leave individuals feeling drained. After a long and tiring day, many prefer to retreat to bed for rest instead of engaging in leisure activities, only to revive and tackle another busy day ahead.While this decline in hobby engagement is understandable, it poses risks to both individuals and society. Many people are currently seeking treatment for various mental health issues. Hobbies provide a valuable outlet for relaxation and stress relief, playing a crucial role in improving mental health. The absence of hobbies can contribute to a community filled with fatigued and indifferent individuals, leading to a lack of care for one another and their environment.In conclusion, it is essential—though challenging—to prioritize hobbies to enhance the well-being of both individuals and society at large. Increased efforts should be made to promote hobbies within schools and workplaces to cultivate a more balanced and fulfilled populace.
595;Write about the following topic.Group or team activities can teach more important skills for life than those activities which are done alone.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The topic of group work can be more beneficial for peoples' lives than person who tend to do some work alone or not is widely discussed across the globe. Personally, I think there are some good advantages team activities cause our life,and especially in business scenes more comfortable and productive.Initially, only one person's work is limited, compared with group activities. This means that working only one person will be able to cause some profits to some extent. On the other hand, group working will be more productive and efficient to make more sales figures. In addition, each person has a great ability. For example, some people have great communication skills and negotiations. Those people arethe most appropriate roles for sales. Furthermore, some people are good at analysing the group performance quality and making strategies. Those who are good at these activities are best for marketing team. As a result, they can focus on their strong points for work and they can divide and conquer the tasks with each other.Of course, some people are eager to work alone at their own relaxed pace and make a profit to some extent. This is less stressful they do not need to keep attention from other colleagues. But this means that they need to decide all tasks and take all responsibility. Sometimes it might be risky once they made a mistake and caused a huge deficit.Finally, there is no doubt that more than two heads are better than one. People can share their experiences and opinion to improve their group activities. If some people who are sensitive and feel pressure if some people meddle in too much. It is necessary to organize some rules that must be effective. For example, all people need to try to stay positive, avoid stating negative or swear words, and not deny one person's opinion straightforwardly and emotionally. Making a great atmosphere, saying positive words with each other, and including some humor, will lead to everyone's performance being more productive.;The benefits of group work compared to individual effort are a widely discussed topic worldwide. I believe that team activities offer significant advantages to our lives, particularly in enhancing comfort and productivity in business environments.To begin with, the scope of an individual's work is often limited when compared to that of a group. An individual may generate some profit, but collective efforts usually yield greater productivity and efficiency, leading to increased sales. Moreover, every person brings unique strengths to the table. For instance, some are natural communicators and excel at negotiations, making them ideal for sales roles. Others have a talent for analyzing group performance and developing strategies, which is essential for marketing teams. This diversity allows team members to leverage their strengths while dividing tasks effectively.Of course, some individuals prefer working alone at their own pace, which can reduce stress as they aren't required to coordinate with colleagues. However, this comes with the burden of making all decisions and bearing all responsibilities. This can be risky, as any mistakes made can lead to significant setbacks.Ultimately, it is clear that collaboration often yields better results. Team members can share experiences and perspectives, enriching the overall group dynamic. To foster a positive working environment, it’s crucial to establish guidelines that promote constructive interactions. For example, maintaining a positive attitude, avoiding negative comments, and treating each other’s opinions with respect can help. Creating a supportive atmosphere filled with encouragement and humor can enhance productivity for everyone involved.
317;Write about the following topic.In many countries large amounts of foods are wasted. Why do you think people waste food in this way? What can be done to reduce the amount of food thrown away?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, many countries are confronted with the increasing amount of waste and one of the major contributions is food wasted by people. This issue is mainly driven by an over-ordered food and misunderstanding about the method of food disposal. However, people could cease from creating food waste through the act of both restaurants and governments.To begin with, it is obvious that countries have wasted because the amount of food that people buy is more than the amount they need. The crucial factor of this behavior is that when people contemplate menus in a restaurant, they tend to order many items in order to satisfy their desire level. Eventually, a lot of food scraps are left when these people finish eating their meals. Another potential cause could be because people do not know how to deal with food scraps. As a result, they might understand that putting wasted food into a garbage is the only solution they could do. This is exemplified by statistics published by Thai waste association which demonstrate that more than a half of waste in Thailand come from household food.A possible solution for this matter could be for restaurants to fine their customers who leave some food. This policy possibly encourages customers to carefully think of the reasonable amount of food when they order. In addition, from the country’s level governments could also educate their citizens including companies in the food-service industry about how to do with food waste due to the fact that some edible items could be food for animals. For instance, authorities could give an instruction demonstrating that dogs can be fed with remaining food such as rice or bread while remaining vegetables can be food for rabbits.In conclusion, people waste food since they order food by what they want without considering the amount and most of them misunderstand about the way to dispose of food waste. Nevertheless, this concern can be coped with the penalty by restaurants as well as the guidance from governments regarding feeding animal with food scraps.;Today, many countries are grappling with the rising tide of waste, and a significant portion of this problem stems from food discarded by individuals. This issue often arises from overordering at restaurants and a lack of understanding about food disposal methods. However, both restaurants and governments can play a role in reducing food waste.Firstly, it is clear that food waste occurs when people purchase more food than they actually need. A key factor contributing to this behavior is that when viewing restaurant menus, diners often order multiple items to satisfy their desires. Consequently, a substantial amount of food is left uneaten. Another contributing factor is that many individuals are unsure of how to manage food scraps effectively. This leads them to believe that throwing away leftover food is the only viable option. For example, statistics published by the Thai Waste Association indicate that over half of the waste in Thailand originates from household food.One potential solution is for restaurants to implement policies that penalize customers who leave food uneaten. Such measures could encourage patrons to thoughtfully consider the appropriate portion sizes when placing their orders. Additionally, at the national level, governments could educate citizens and businesses in the food service industry about how to handle food waste, as some leftover items can be repurposed as animal feed. Authorities could provide guidance, for instance, on feeding dogs leftover rice or bread, while certain vegetables could be suitable for rabbits.In conclusion, food waste arises when individuals order based on desires without considering portion sizes, along with misunderstandings about food disposal. However, this challenge can be addressed through penalties imposed by restaurants and educational initiatives from governments on using food scraps to feed animals.
1025;Write about the following topic.In many countries, a small number of people earn extremely high salaries. Some people believe that this is good for the country, but others think that governments should not allow salaries above a certain level.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In many parts of the world, few people get a lot of money thanks to their job. It is believed by some that this is an advantage for the country, while it is thought by others that governments should put a limit above which salaries cannot be.In my opinion, I believe that not only people have to be rewarded for their performance, but also their wage salary has to be proportional to the benefits that they are leading to the country.For instance, due to the Covid a lot of people suffered several injuries which were cured only thanks to the doctors and the nurses. For this reason, since they are saving lifes everyday,it seems unbelievable the fact that they are earning much less money than football players.Another example can be found in people involved in the national security: I believe that it would be fairer if these professionals were paid more than an influencer.However, in our society this figures (such as doctors) are paid by governments through taxes, while football players or influncers gain incomes by private companies.In order to not impose an heavier taxation, politics should categorise jobs basing on their importance in the society. Hence, we will have a specific amount that these employers can earn.Thus, if these no-fundamental workers (like actors or actress) are earning more money than the precise level chosen, these will be used as funds to increase life-saving jobs' salary.In conclusion, I believe that highest salaries should exist only if we are referring to a job that is needed by everyone.;In many regions around the globe, only a small number of individuals earn substantial incomes from their jobs. Some believe this serves as a benefit to the country, while others argue that governments should establish a cap on salaries. In my view, it is essential that individuals are rewarded for their performance and that their salaries reflect the benefits they provide to society. For example, during the Covid pandemic, many people suffered from various health issues that were treated thanks to the dedicated efforts of doctors and nurses. It is astounding that these professionals, who save lives every day, earn significantly less than football players.Another illustrative case is that of those working in national security. I believe it would be more equitable for these individuals to receive higher salaries than influencers. In our society, roles like doctors are compensated through government funding derived from taxes, while football players and influencers earn their income from private enterprises.To avoid imposing excessive taxation, policymakers should categorize jobs based on their societal importance. This would allow for a determined salary ceiling for certain professions. If individuals in less critical roles, such as actors or actresses, earn salaries above this set threshold, the surplus could be redirected to enhance the pay of essential workers.In conclusion, I believe that the highest salaries should be reserved for roles that are indispensable to society.
233;Write about the following topic.In some parts of the world people try to find out one's own family history. Why do people do this? Do you think it is a positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"At present, discovering one`s own family history is becoming more and more commom. In the following paragraphs, I will present the motives why people do that and the reason I strongly believe this is important and have positive effects on people.Probably the most crucial motive people search for their family`s past is to find out about any chronical diseases. One of society`s biggest concern nowadays is healthy leaving. Therefore, by knowing the family health history and genetic predisposition to a specific disease such as cancer or diabetes, one can prepare and take the appropriate mesures to prevent it or have an early treatment.Moreover, another reason people may seek for their ancestors`s history is to build a sense of belonging. Human beings need to feel welcomed and inserted into a culture; a community`s identity is as important as an individual one, as it provides people with the opportunity to grow and develop relantioships. When people know about their family history, their sense of belonging is promoted, and they can actively participate in their culture and contribute to their community.As mentioned in the previous paragraphs, people search about family history for health and cultural reasons. One and the other do impact positivily a person`s life, as being healthy and part of a community integrate people`s satisfaction about living.To summarize, one may try to find out about their family history for two main motives, one being about their health and the other one about feeling part of a community. Both reasons are important and have positive impacts on one`s life.";Currently, exploring one’s family history is becoming increasingly popular. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss the motivations behind this trend and explain why I believe it is significant and beneficial for individuals.One of the primary reasons people delve into their family’s past is to uncover information about potential hereditary health issues. In today's society, there is a heightened focus on healthy living. By understanding their family health history and genetic predispositions to certain conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, individuals can take proactive steps to prevent these diseases or seek early treatment when necessary.Additionally, many people seek to uncover their ancestors' stories in order to foster a sense of belonging. Humans have an innate desire to feel connected and integrated within a culture. The identity of a community is just as vital as that of an individual, as it allows people to grow and form meaningful relationships. By learning about their family history, individuals enhance their sense of belonging and can fully engage in their culture while contributing to their community.As highlighted in the previous paragraphs, individuals pursue their family history for both health and cultural reasons. These factors positively influence one’s life, as good health and community involvement significantly enhance overall life satisfaction.In conclusion, people are motivated to explore their family history primarily for two reasons: health awareness and a desire for community connection. Both of these aspects are important and can lead to positive outcomes in one’s life.
987;Write about the following topic.Information technology is changing many aspects of our lives and now dominates our home, leisure and work activities.To what extent do the benefits of information technology outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;There is no doubt that these days information technology has invaded our space and dominated our home leisure and work. However, the question: is dominating our lives by this technology have a negative or positive impact on our lives? Is considered one of the most controversial issues today. In this essay, I am going to examine this phenomenon from both viewpoints.On one side of the argument, some people argue that the benefits considerably outweigh the disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is integrating technology in every aspect eases our lives and decreases hardworking. For example, advanced houses with integrated voice commands give the person the ability to achieve multiple tasks without any physical activity. Moreover, the technology allows people to connect multiple devices with an email address and control them remotely. One good illustration of that you can switch on and off your home AC while you are at work by the WIFI technology.On the other hand, it is also possible to consider it with the opposing case. It is often argued that in fact using advanced technology increase the number of unhealthy people. People often have this opinion because people become lazier, and their daily activity dramatically decreases making them prone to diseases.As we have seen, there are no easy answers to this question. On balance, however, I tend to believe that using advanced information technology should be limited to simple tasks, so at any point if a technical error happened you can resume your life without any obstacles.;There is no doubt that information technology has permeated our lives and taken over our leisure and work at home. However, the debate over whether this technological dominance has a positive or negative impact on our lives is highly contentious. In this essay, I will explore both sides of this issue.On one hand, many people believe that the advantages significantly outweigh the drawbacks. They argue that the integration of technology into our daily routines simplifies our lives and reduces the need for strenuous effort. For instance, modern smart homes equipped with voice command features enable individuals to manage multiple tasks without any physical movement. Additionally, technology allows for the remote control of various devices via email, such as adjusting the air conditioning in your home while you're at work through Wi-Fi.Conversely, some argue that the rise of advanced technology has led to an increase in health problems. Critics claim that reliance on tech fosters laziness, resulting in a decrease in physical activity, which can lead to various health issues.As we can see, there are no straightforward answers to this complex question. Ultimately, I lean towards the view that the use of advanced information technology should be restricted to simpler tasks, ensuring that any technical issues do not disrupt our daily lives severely.
1033;Write about the following topic.It is inevitable that traditional cultures will be lost as technology develops. Technology and traditional cultures are incompatible.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many people hold the view that traditional culture and technological development cannot coexist as the latter catch on, the former will be bound to disappear. I totally disagree with this because both can be implemented jointly by putting technology at the service of tradition and through pilot projects.To begin with, technological progress, which is making major strides in our daily lives, is the means by which local mores, custom and traditions could be brought back to life, proving they are compatible. In fact, by tapping technology to make tradition far more attractive, considerably more audience will be engaged into such activities. Bologna is a case in point, since, thanks to digital machines and drones which have supported housewives into the making of , the traditional celebration of “making pasta day ” has recently being turned into a successful events, which draws people from country as far afield as China.Another example of possible coexistence is the possibility to heighten awareness of people costumes through the creation of pilot projects which bring both habits and technology to a new whole level. This can be put into practice by setting a direct connection to cultural heritage of a specific area of the world to those who do not have access easily. To this end, many primary schools in New York have developed a project in which, owing to the ultimate high speed connection, pupils who come from abroad can learn ancient craft directly from a master located in their country of origin.To conclude, I firmly believe that traditional culture and technology development are widely compatible as the technology can positively beef up the presence of cultural traditions nowadays, so as to keep its memory Alive. In addition, pioneering projects can be implemented to underpin cultural awareness amongst youngsters.;Many people think that traditional culture and technological development cannot coexist, believing that as technology advances, tradition will inevitably fade away. I strongly disagree with this perspective, as both can coexist harmoniously by leveraging technology to support tradition and implementing pilot projects.Firstly, technological advancements that significantly influence our daily lives can actually revitalize local customs, traditions, and practices, showcasing their compatibility. By using technology to make these traditions more appealing, we can engage a much larger audience in such activities. A prime example is Bologna, where digital tools and drones have assisted housewives in the pasta-making process, transforming the traditional event known as “Making Pasta Day” into a successful spectacle that attracts participants from as far away as China.Another illustration of coexistence lies in the development of pilot projects that enhance awareness of cultural practices by integrating tradition with technology. This can be achieved by establishing direct connections to the cultural heritage of specific regions for those who might not have easy access. For instance, various primary schools in New York have initiated programs that allow students from abroad to learn ancient crafts directly from masters in their countries of origin, facilitated by high-speed internet connections.In conclusion, I firmly believe that traditional culture and technological development are indeed compatible. Technology can play a crucial role in enhancing the visibility of cultural traditions today, ensuring that they remain vibrant and memorable. Additionally, innovative projects can be launched to foster cultural awareness among younger generations.
1117;Write about the following topic.It is now possible for scientists and tourists to travel to remote natural environment, such as the South Pole.What are advantages and disadvantages of this development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Thanks to the development of our society, individuals can now travel to isolated areas, namely the South Pole. Never has this area been exploded before so researchers could discover crucial information for thesis and tourists could appreciate a fabulous landscape. However, discovering those faraway environments could increase environment-related issues such as climatic change.South Pole is a place which has ever seen human activities before, and it seems to have numerous discoveries to make. Indeed, scientists which fauna and flora are the current studies, could find new mode of the marine life and discover new species. Moreover, people who are interested in travelling to South Pole might now do it, children who dreamed about polar animals could see them. Thus, the tourism should create new jobs and develop economic growth.Nevertheless, as each breakthrough that the society does, there are repercussions. In this case, the harmful effect of this discovery is global warming because when humans go somewhere, they let a carbon footprint which directly changes the environment. For instance, if individuals had to travel to South Pole, they would only use air or marine transport such as cruise ship which pollute the area with greenhouse gases. As a result, those greenhouse gases can warm nature which, unfortunately, would melt the ice and have a detrimental impact on the landscapes. As a consequence, in the forthcoming decades, this panorama may disappear. Thereby, if scientists want to study this natural area, they could not or in a limited way.To conclude, the advantages could be to discover new landscapes and how species can live in this hostile area. However, just going into this remote natural environment could destroy it before discovering something.;Thanks to advancements in our society, people can now explore remote locations like the South Pole. This region has previously been untouched, allowing researchers to uncover vital information for their studies and enabling tourists to witness breathtaking landscapes. However, venturing into these distant environments may also exacerbate environmental issues, such as climate change.The South Pole is an area that has experienced human activity, yet it still holds many opportunities for discovery. Scientists are currently studying its flora and fauna, which may lead to the identification of new marine life and previously unknown species. Additionally, those with a passion for travel can now visit the South Pole, fulfilling childhood dreams of encountering polar animals. This influx of tourism could generate new jobs and spur economic growth.Nevertheless, as with any societal advancement, there are consequences. One significant downside to this exploration is its contribution to global warming. Human activities create a carbon footprint that adversely affects the environment. For example, if tourists travel to the South Pole, they typically rely on air or marine transport, such as cruise ships, which emit greenhouse gases and pollute the area. This rise in greenhouse gases contributes to global warming, leading to melting ice and detrimental changes to the landscape. Consequently, in the coming decades, this stunning panorama may disappear, limiting future scientific research.In conclusion, while exploring this remote natural setting could lead to new discoveries about its ecosystems, the act of accessing these fragile environments may ultimately cause irreversible damage before any meaningful findings can be made.

Some people,however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;This is a world that fast developing and full of pollution.there is a worldwide problem whether economic progress is the most important goal when the other types problem are increasing. In my word is economic progress is important than other problems.Firstly,this is an economic world. human life condition is base on their income. For example,there have a village with poor people. They might working hard for live but they must have no time to think about other goal. This is reason why the governments to develop social economic . it is not uncommon that government have no money to solve the problem that environment pollution and others.Second, although economic progress is necessary for people but it also lead to other problems. With the increasing income it might need more resources to build the country. If it not solved correctly that give rise to more problems. The other types of progress will have a good developing when the economic progress finished and the government get enough money.Overall , i prefer economic progress to other types of progress. The better life come from money and the solution of the other types problem are come from the good economy.;We live in a rapidly developing world that faces significant pollution challenges. There is an ongoing debate about whether economic progress should be our primary goal, particularly as various other issues continue to escalate. In my opinion, economic progress holds greater importance than these other problems.Firstly, we inhabit an economic world where people's living conditions are largely determined by their income. For instance, in a village with impoverished residents, individuals may work tirelessly to survive but lack the time to address broader goals or issues. This underscores the rationale behind governments prioritizing socio-economic development, often leading to circumstances where they lack the financial resources to tackle environmental pollution and other concerns.Secondly, while economic growth is vital, it can also give rise to additional problems. As incomes rise, there is often a greater demand for resources to support national development. If these challenges are not addressed effectively, they can lead to even more complications. Other forms of progress can flourish once economic growth is achieved and the government has sufficient funds.In conclusion, I prioritize economic progress over other types of advancement. A better quality of life is closely associated with financial stability, and solutions to various issues often emerge from a strong economy.
555;Write about the following topic.Many parents today organise extra classes for their children after school and at the weekends.Do you feel that this is a worthwhile thing to do or do you feel children have enough education at school?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays educational institutions are equipped with devices that were unimaginable only a few years ago, which offer many opportunities to children to study every kind of subject. In other words, the technology introduced in schools helps many children to learn various subjects with different gadgets, such geography, art, maths by computers or history by means of audio-visual-techniques. However, I believe that children thanks to these appealing methods of learning have enough education and they need some time to unwind and experience their life with other activites.To begin with, apply children to extra classes at the weekends has become an issue of debate by many people. I hold firmly to the belief that children after schools need to dedicate their free time on sports. However, sports and other physical activities help young people to enhance their concentration, self-esteem and cognitive skills, social skills with their peer group. For example the most popular and suitable to children are sports with teams, such as football, basketball etc... where children could learn how to collaborate with other mates and the leadership skills gained in sports can help kids to excel in school, life and in the workplace, such as organising a good teamwork.On the other hand, there are few parents who argue that children need to attend extra classes at schools during the weekends. For instance, the world is still facing a global pandemic of covid-19, which caused many problems of attendency of students in many educational institutions due to various measures introduced. However this led many students to lazyness and reduction of methods of gaining knowledge, because it is widely believed that online lessons are not interactive as the lessons in presence. Moreover using continously a technological gadget for hours may cause distraction and negative mental effects. So the better solution for some people is to let their children do extra classes in presence in order to make up for the hours lost during the online lessons.To sum up, children need to experience different activities afterschool in order to have a good educational career. However some parents consider the extra classes an acceptable opportunity to not lose the methods of studying.;Today’s educational institutions are equipped with technology that was unimaginable just a few years ago, providing students with numerous opportunities to explore a wide range of subjects. This advancement in technology enables children to learn various topics—such as geography, art, and math—through computers, or to study history using audiovisual techniques. However, I believe that while these engaging learning methods are valuable, children also need time to relax and participate in other activities.One significant debate centers around whether children should attend extra classes on weekends. I strongly believe that after school, children should focus on sports and physical activities. Engaging in sports helps young people improve their concentration, self-esteem, cognitive skills, and social interactions with their peers. Team sports, like football and basketball, are particularly beneficial, as they teach children collaboration and leadership skills that can translate into success in school and in future careers, such as effective teamwork.On the other hand, some parents argue that children should participate in extra classes on weekends. The ongoing global pandemic has created challenges for students attending educational institutions, leading to disruptions in learning due to various health measures. This situation has contributed to issues such as student laziness and a decline in effective learning methods, as many believe that online lessons lack the interactivity of in-person instruction. Moreover, prolonged use of technological devices can lead to distractions and adverse mental effects. Therefore, some parents feel that allowing their children to attend in-person extra classes is an effective way to compensate for the learning lost during online lessons.In conclusion, while children should engage in various activities outside of school to foster a well-rounded educational experience, some parents view extra classes as a practical option to maintain their learning momentum.
305;Write about the following topic.Many people use written language in a less formal and more relaxed way. Why? Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, written language is used in comparatively more informal and relaxed way. I assume that it happens because of the need of making communication easier and faster. Without features of formal written language it is simplier to share your idea in a shorter period of time. This option is essential in a modern temp of life. This essay will cover both advantages and disadvantages of this development.The less formal and tense written language provides some pros. First of all, without formalization the process of communication requires less amount of time. Then letters consists of less number of symbols and can help to solve the discussed problem much faster. Moreover, this way of communication does not support formal borders between members of a dialogue. Then it is easier to come closer with the interlocutor and feel no pressure during the using of written language.On the other hand, development of making written language more informal and relaxed has some cons. Firstly, communication goes less respectful. Then interlocutors have almost no opportunity to pay a respect to each other. Formalized written language is significant in issue of social borders that can hihlight a paid respect. Secondly, sometimes the main gist of the letter goes unclear, because informal language is more relaxed. In these conditions, the quidity of the letter can be hidden with less formal features. If participants of the communication are not close, they will not understand each other correctly.In conclusion I would like to say that the process of using written language in a more informal way has both advantages and disadvantages. It can be revealed in different situations. That is why everyone should have their own opinion based on the information discussed in this essay.;In contemporary times, written language is often utilized in a more informal and relaxed manner. This trend likely stems from the need for streamlined and rapid communication. Without the constraints of formal written conventions, it becomes easier to convey ideas quickly. This flexibility is crucial in today's fast-paced world. This essay will explore both the benefits and drawbacks of this shift toward informal writing.The trend toward less formal written language offers several advantages. Firstly, the communication process becomes more time-efficient without the need for formal structures. Messages can be conveyed using fewer words or symbols, enabling quicker resolution of discussions. Furthermore, informal communication tends to break down barriers between participants, allowing for a more relaxed interaction. This fosters a sense of closeness and reduces pressure when engaging in written dialogue.Conversely, the move toward a more casual style of writing also presents some disadvantages. One significant drawback is that communication often lacks respect. Without formalities, interlocutors may miss opportunities to acknowledge and honor each other's viewpoints. Formal written language plays a vital role in establishing social boundaries that reflect mutual respect. Additionally, informality can lead to ambiguity, making it challenging to grasp the core message of a letter. The relaxed nature of such communication may obscure meaning, especially if the participants are not already familiar with each other’s communication styles.In conclusion, the trend of adopting a more informal approach to written language has both its merits and drawbacks. Its impact can vary greatly depending on the context. Therefore, individuals should form their own opinions based on the insights presented in this essay.
1161;Write about the following topic.More and more people are relying on the private car as their major means of transportation.Describe some of the problems over-reliance on cars can cause, and suggest at least one possible solution.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;That of trasportation is a question that have troubled all the people over the world, whatever it is the city or town in which they live. In the last years people used to relying on the private car to move around. . Although the possible reasons that persuaded people to use private cars, the problems that rise from their excessive use, such us traffic and pollution, are harsh consequences to be accepted. I think that an improvement of public trasportation and to incentive the use of ecological means of trasport like bicycle should be possible solution to those issues.Cars are considered the most confortable mean of trasport. In particular, if you have to move in a big cities like Milan. Indeed, means of trasports sometimes are late or full and also more unsafe. If you are a woman, for example, the use of public trasportation in some part of Italy is not safe mostly during the night hours. Another problem is that of comfort. If people use their car they can go whethever they want, when they want. If they have to spend more time in a place, they have not to be worried about the last bus they had to take to come back home.However, over-reliance of cars cause at least two big problmes: traffic and pollution. On the one hand, the problem of traffic will produce other issues such as anxiety and irritation. Indeed, if you have to go work in the morning and you live in a city like Rome you have to consider at least one hour spent in the traffic. Pollution is surely the most severe issue. Indeed, if all the people used to take a private car, then it is easely imaginable how much cars and fuel can be consumed daily. The two problems are linked, I want to underline, indeed, the noise pollution that derives from an intense traffic. It should be considered dangerous both for persons and animals.Two possible solutions to the problem of the over-reliance on cars are the following. Firstly, public trasportation should be improved. Indeed, if bus and tram were more safe and more confortable, then people would be more tent by their use. At least, they will solve the problem of traffic. On the other hand, I see the echologycal means of transport like bycicle as the new border to pass in order to save the world from pollution. One possible suggestion would be that of make cheaper the bycicle and also to give an economic subsidy to those people who decide to help the planet using them.In conclusion, I believe that the the use of private cars, because of the problems that it causes, should be discouraged. Two possible solutions rely on the improvement of public trasportation and on the incentive can be given to those using non-polluting means of trasport;Transportation is a pressing issue that affects people worldwide, regardless of whether they live in a city or a small town. In recent years, many individuals have come to rely heavily on private cars for their mobility. While there are various reasons why people prefer using their personal vehicles, the negative consequences of this excessive dependence—such as traffic congestion and pollution—are significant challenges we cannot ignore. I believe that enhancing public transportation and promoting the use of environmentally friendly options like bicycles could be effective solutions to these problems.Cars are often seen as the most comfortable mode of transport, especially in large cities like Milan. Public transportation can sometimes be unreliable, overcrowded, or even unsafe. For instance, women, in particular, may feel vulnerable using public transport in some areas of Italy, especially during nighttime. The convenience of private cars allows individuals to travel wherever and whenever they wish, without the worry of having to catch the last bus home if they stay out longer than planned.However, this over-reliance on cars leads to significant issues like traffic congestion and pollution. Traffic problems can create additional stress and frustration. For example, if you commute to work in a city like Rome, you might spend at least an hour stuck in traffic each morning. Pollution is perhaps the most pressing concern. If everyone relied on private vehicles, one can easily imagine the enormous amounts of fuel consumed daily. These problems are interconnected, especially considering how noise pollution from heavy traffic can pose risks to both people and wildlife.To address the issue of excessive car use, I propose two potential solutions. First, public transportation should be improved. If buses and trams were safer and more comfortable, more people would likely choose to use them, alleviating traffic congestion. Second, promoting eco-friendly modes of transport, like bicycles, could play a pivotal role in combating pollution. Making bicycles more affordable and offering financial incentives for those who opt for them could encourage wider adoption.In conclusion, I believe that the use of private cars should be discouraged due to the various problems they cause. Improving public transportation and incentivizing non-polluting modes of transport are two viable solutions to help mitigate these challenges.
1051;"Write about the following topic.Most people have forgotten the meaning behind traditional or religious festivals; during festival periods, people nowadays only want to enjoy themselves.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.";"In recent years, it is argued that many people have lost track of the meaning behind traditional and religious celebrations; Now, people seem to treat these celebrations as another holiday break. The following essay will fully endorse the statement and examine the reasons behind it.Firstly, there are several reasons why people forgot about the message behind celebrations. One of the most significant one is globalisation. As people start connecting with each other through social media worldwide, many people are too distracted with the latest trends and updates. A study from Yales University mentioned that 60% of the population on earth do not persuit the stories about their traditional roots and background. Hence, they do not celebrate festive or cultural events meaningfully. Another important reason is broken families. People who experienced a tough childhood without a male or female parent are not capable of understanding their own traditions and values. Therefore, they do not grasp the concept of cultural celebrations.Moreover, there are also cons to this arguments as people just want to take a holiday break. Although people may argue that it is important to remember the intention behind diverse celebrations, others just want to use the day for self-fulfillment purposes. For example, people would organise a party and invite friends over to their house so they can have a good time. Another argument that people only want enjoyment during festive periods is work-stress related illnesses. The majority of middle class workers are hardworking and dedicated to their job. However, the period of time for holiday breaks are significantly short and they just want to use the celebration events to rest at home. Despite the fact that they are neglecting their duties to demonstrate the meaning behind these celebrations to the younger generations, they also have a right to take care of themselves mentally and physically before others.In conclusion, there are both sides of the argument on why people think others have forgotten the meaning behind event celebrations and why this is not neccesarily true all the time. Personally, I agree that people should always find the meaning behind these celebrations in order to understand themselves better.";In recent years, it has been suggested that many individuals have lost sight of the significance of traditional and religious celebrations, treating them merely as holidays for leisure. This essay will support this viewpoint and explore the reasons behind this trend.To begin with, several factors contribute to the diminishing understanding of the messages these celebrations convey. One of the primary reasons is globalization. As people connect through social media, they often become engrossed in the latest trends and updates. Research from Yale University indicates that 60% of the global population does not seek to understand their cultural roots and history, leading to a superficial engagement with festive or cultural events. Another crucial factor is the prevalence of broken families. Individuals who have experienced challenging childhoods, often lacking parental guidance, may struggle to comprehend their own traditions and values, making it difficult for them to appreciate the essence of cultural celebrations.On the other hand, there are arguments in favor of individuals prioritizing holiday breaks over traditional meanings. While some may contend that it is essential to remember the purpose behind various celebrations, others may simply wish to use the time for personal enjoyment. For instance, individuals might throw parties and invite friends to socialize and have fun. Additionally, the stress related to work in middle-class jobs often leaves employees yearning for a break. With holiday periods being relatively short, many people opt to use celebrations as an opportunity to relax at home. While this may neglect the responsibility of passing down the significance of these celebrations to younger generations, individuals also deserve to prioritize their mental and physical well-being.In conclusion, there are valid arguments for both perspectives on whether people have forgotten the meaning behind celebrations. Personally, I believe it is important for individuals to seek out the significance of these festivities in order to foster a deeper understanding of themselves.
939;Write about the following topic.Music is played in every society and culture in the world today.Some people think that music brings only benefits to individuals and societies. Others, however, think that music can have a negative influence on both.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Music is the moonlight in the gloomy night of life.It is the universal language of mankind.There are mixed opinions about music on whether it is advantageous or not to individuals and society.This essay will discuss about pros and cons of music being part of our life.Some people have a perception that playing or listening to music is not beneficial in any manner. They feel music separates a person from socializing and that it is a form of addiction and distraction.Especially, parents feel that their child's concentration is impacted while multitasking with music and studies.For extroverts its a sort of discomfort or hindrance.Few extroverts feel better to share their feelings and difficulties with others than staying alone and listening to a song. Few recorded instances has suggested that sad music inculcates negative thoughts and aggression while in depression.On the other hand, there are people who think that music having a negative effect on individual and society is completely preposterous.They feel that tunes produces a kind of pleasure which human nature cannot do without.Music is a form of expression of feelings rather than being a hindrance.It greatly helps people to overcome their hurdles.Soothing and melodious music gives a refreshing effect.Jazz and Pop music facilitates society to come together and dance.Concerrts helps certain groups to spend time for relaxation from their busy schedule.Not only that, singing or playing instruments is a form of expression of their feelings.The essay argued that though music is considered to be a distraction , it is a form of rejuvenation to both society and individuals of all age groups.;Music serves as the moonlight in the dark and trying moments of life, acting as a universal language for humanity. Opinions on the role of music in our lives are varied, with some arguing its benefits and others questioning its impact on individuals and society. This essay will explore the advantages and disadvantages of music in our daily lives.Some individuals believe that engaging with music, whether through playing or listening, does not offer any real benefits. They argue that music can isolate people from social interactions and can become a source of addiction and distraction. Parents, in particular, may feel that their children's ability to concentrate suffers when they attempt to juggle studying with musical entertainment. For some extroverts, music can be a source of discomfort or a barrier to connection, as they may prefer to share their feelings and struggles with others rather than retreat into solitude with a song. Additionally, there are instances where sad music has been linked to negative thoughts and increased aggression during depressive episodes.Conversely, many people find the claim that music has a negative impact on individuals and society to be utterly misguided. They argue that music is a source of joy that is essential to human nature. Rather than being a distraction, music serves as a powerful form of emotional expression that helps individuals navigate their challenges. Soothing and melodic tunes can provide a refreshing escape, while genres like jazz and pop bring communities together to celebrate and dance. Concerts offer people an opportunity to relax and unwind from their hectic lives, and singing or playing instruments allows for personal expression.In conclusion, while music is often seen as a distraction, it can actually serve as a rejuvenating force for individuals and society as a whole, benefiting people of all ages.
587;Write about the following topic.Nowadays, sports is a big business with high earnings for professional sports people and companies involved both financially and other ways. Is this a positive or negative development for sports?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is argued that using mobile devices is as antisocial as smoking and that in certain areas smoking has been forbidden so mobile devices should be prohibited as well. I strongly disagree with this statement because this would not solve the initial problem and could turn out expensive as well.Firstly, banning mobile devices from certain places would be exagerated. This is because smoking actually damages your body, while the use of mobile phones is comparatively harmless. For example, a recent research found out that the risk of lung cancer grows by 0,02% with every cigarette, while high screen time has less damaging side effects like the loss of concentration. Altough the use of mobile phones is sometimes antisocial, I think that we should concentrate on the origins of this problem than simply prohibit it in certain areas.Secondly, banning mobile devices would have a regulatory side effect which could be expensive. The government would have to decide on new laws as well as implement them. Furthermore, it would be no easy task for the police to control these rules in an efficient way. As a result, police would struggle with a high workload. Admittely, I have enough faith in our legal system and I am sure that they could manage it but I think that we have more prescious und urgent tasks to concentrate on.In conclusion, I strongly disagree with banning mobile devices in certain areas. However, I admit that we use our phones too much which sometimes leads to antisocial behaviour. Nevertheless, prohibiting the phones in certain areas would not solve this problem and could as well be expensive for the government.;Some argue that using mobile devices is as antisocial as smoking, suggesting that just as smoking has been banned in certain locations, mobile device usage should face similar restrictions. I strongly disagree with this perspective, as it fails to address the root of the issue and could lead to unnecessary expenses.To begin with, implementing a ban on mobile devices in specific places would be excessive. While smoking poses actual health risks, such as serious damage to the body, the use of mobile phones is relatively innocuous by comparison. For instance, recent research indicates that the risk of lung cancer increases by 0.02% with each cigarette, whereas prolonged screen time has less severe consequences, such as diminished concentration. Although mobile phone usage can indeed foster antisocial behavior at times, I believe we should focus on addressing the underlying causes rather than resorting to prohibitions.Moreover, enacting a ban on mobile devices would create regulatory challenges that could be costly. The government would need to develop and implement new laws, which would not be an easy task for law enforcement to manage effectively. This could lead to an increased workload for police officers. While I have faith in our legal system's ability to handle such matters, I believe there are more pressing and valuable issues that deserve our attention.In summary, I firmly oppose the idea of banning mobile devices in certain areas. While I acknowledge that excessive phone use can contribute to antisocial behavior, instituting a ban would not resolve the core problem and could also impose significant costs on the government.
1133;Write about the following topic.People in all modern societies use drugs, but today's youth are experimenting with both legal and illegal drugs, and at an increasingly early age. Some sociologists claim that parents and other members of society often set a bad example.Discuss the causes and some effects of widespread drug use by young people in modern day society. Make any recommendations you feel are necessary to help fight youth drug abuse.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The use of drugs has been a warning habit in modern day society. In some research, it shows that households are losing their financing easily due to the fact that one of the parents has been addicted to drugs. Although there are some drugs which were approved by the government to be used moderately, yet some people are using these drugs heavily.This has drawn the attention of the youth either by a drug addict parent or a friend. Moreover, the number of youngsters taking drugs has increased dramatically throughout the years as there are people who provide these drugs in the black market. This critical issue has caused serious issues both socially and mentally.The social and mental impact of using drugs by the youngsters have damaged the educational progress, the social participation such as family and friends gatherings. Additionally, lack of stamina, weight loss, and loss of appetite are key factors of excessive use of drugs.There is a number of contributing elements to the phenomena. One of these elements is the sense of belonging to a group. Since humans are social animals, young people want to have the feeling of being accepted and loved, and this can be sensible when it comes to a group of friends. Therefore, once someone introduces a drug, the rest of the group will try, and if one says no, then they will be rejected. However, this rejection can be helping to solve this alarming issue.The solution is to find a way to distinguish the types of drugs and legalize the ones that do not harm greatly and prepare in parallel the better ways to control the consumption of drugs.;"The use of drugs has become a concerning trend in contemporary society. Research indicates that many families are struggling financially due to one parent’s addiction. While some drugs are government-approved for moderate use, there are individuals who misuse these substances extensively.This issue has particularly affected the youth, as they may be influenced by a parent or friend who is a drug user. Over the years, there has been a significant rise in the number of young people using drugs, fueled by the availability of these substances in the black market. This pressing matter has resulted in severe social and mental consequences.The effects of drug use among young people can hinder their educational progress and reduce their social engagement with family and friends. Additionally, excessive drug use can lead to physical health issues, including fatigue, weight loss, and loss of appetite.Several factors contribute to this phenomenon. A strong sense of belonging to a peer group often drives young individuals to seek acceptance and love among their friends. Consequently, when one member of the group introduces drugs, others may be inclined to try them as well; those who refuse may face social rejection. However, such rejection can also serve as a means to address this troubling issue.To combat this challenge, it is essential to differentiate between various types of drugs and consider legalizing those that pose minimal harm, while simultaneously developing more effective methods to regulate drug use."

I agree with this point of view because everyone they should have a chance. There were a opportunities and benefits.The first point, I would like to make is that there were a great opportunities for both rich countries and people who came from poor areas. When people thinking to transfer abroad there were many reason but the most important when they want a chance to show of there craft and ability. Such as, Indian people they travelled many areas and they give them a lot of discoveries and skills; moreover, the rich countries need some people to help to make their country better place for living. For example, I have read an article in the newspaper they talked about development countries like UK, US and Arabic countries they need those people to improve their economy and life.The second point, I will clarify is that there were many benefits when this countries allow jobs for those. They will be equality for all ;furthermore, there will be a improvement in living. For instance, I have saw a T.V decomontry they say "" In United States there are a equality and improvement in live between people they came from Africaand citizens they help them to have good education, skills and experience also they contribute the US economy to growth "".Finally, we can say that there were a opportunities and benefits for both sides. I am with this to have good life for all. I hope in the future poor countries they can take benefits from those people and developed their country to came better than now .";"In developing countries, it is essential to offer job opportunities to skilled and experienced individuals from poorer nations. I support this perspective because everyone deserves a chance, and this practice brings numerous opportunities and benefits.Firstly, I want to emphasize that there are significant opportunities for both wealthy nations and individuals from less affluent backgrounds. When people consider relocating abroad, they often have various motivations, but the primary reason is the desire to showcase their talents and skills. For instance, many Indian individuals have traveled to different countries and made substantial contributions through their expertise. Additionally, wealthier nations require skilled workers to help enhance their living conditions. For example, I recently read an article discussing how countries like the UK, the US, and various Arab nations rely on skilled immigrants to boost their economies and improve the quality of life for everyone.Secondly, I would like to highlight the benefits that arise when these nations provide employment opportunities to individuals from less privileged backgrounds. This practice promotes equality and fosters improvement in living standards. I watched a documentary that noted, ""In the United States, there is equality and progress in the quality of life for both individuals from Africa and native citizens, as these migrants gain access to quality education, skills development, and contribute significantly to the growth of the US economy.""In conclusion, it is evident that there are both opportunities and benefits for all parties involved. I advocate for creating a pathway to a better life for everyone. I hope that in the future, individuals from poorer countries can capitalize on these opportunities to develop their nations, allowing them to thrive more than they do today."

Others value quality of work above appearance.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Manners in the workplace have always been a topic that is discussed by many people as it is essential to know how we should behave in such a formal environment. Some companies give the opinion that their workers should have a smart look while others consider the attitude toward the job more important.To my mind, appearance should not the only thing to be considered. We can dress smartly and impress others, but it is only the first impression. Therefore, productivity, quality of work, and the way we are responsible for our tasks are things that make us outstanding workers. Moreover, it is obvious that the success of one company does not depend on how its employees dress but on how it is organized.In spite of the fact that dressing does not play a key role in the value of a worker, a neat and intelligent appearance still gives us significant benefits. I always suggest that one should dress suitably in different situations. In fact, it is not crucial for an organization to ask their employees to dress formally, but a set of smart casual clothes is something that we should wear when it comes to the working environment. It is because that wearing politely shows how we respect our jobs, our employers, and even our workmates. In some cases, a company's professionalism can be seen through the way its workers wear.To sum up, dressing smartly is not the best and only thing that one worker can do to have better performance. However, having a good appearance is something that great employees would do since it can be considered as their respect for the jobs.;"Workplace manners have long been a topic of discussion, as it is crucial to understand appropriate behavior in a formal setting. Some companies emphasize the importance of employee appearance, while others prioritize work ethic and attitude. In my opinion, appearance should not be the sole focus. We can certainly dress well and make a strong first impression, but ultimately, productivity, quality of work, and accountability are what truly distinguish outstanding employees. Furthermore, a company's success is determined more by its organization than by how its staff members dress.Although attire may not be the most important aspect of an employee's value, maintaining a tidy and professional appearance can still yield significant advantages. I believe that individuals should dress appropriately for different situations. While it is not essential for organizations to enforce a formal dress code, opting for smart casual attire in a work environment is advisable. Dressing appropriately demonstrates respect for our jobs, employers, and colleagues. In many instances, a company's professionalism is reflected in the way its employees present themselves.In conclusion, dressing well is not the only factor that contributes to an employee's performance; however, a good appearance is a sign of respect for one's work and can enhance the impression great employees make."

Conversely, others argue that such information is too important or valuable to be offered for free. This essay will discuss both perspectives and present my viewpoint.With advancements in technology, individuals now have greater access to valuable information, including experimental results and citizens' survey data, than ever before. Many utilize this information for academic pursuits or to inform business strategies, leading to the belief that sharing such data can contribute to companies' profits and enhance individuals' academic success. For instance, medical students often study past dissertations on diseases. By engaging with this scientific information, they develop into highly skilled professionals.On the other hand, the internet allows people to access information from around the globe. However, the rise in cybercrime has become a significant concern worldwide. As a result, some believe that sharing valuable information poses too great a risk. If sensitive national research data were to be compromised, the economic repercussions could be substantial.In conclusion, while sharing information can greatly benefit individuals and businesses by improving academic skills and supporting company growth, there are potential risks, such as information leakage and cybercrime, that must be considered.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Environmental problems are the biggest issue that people have to concern and by product form fossil fuels is one of causes. Someone think one way that can reduce result from fuels is sale car fuels in higher price. In my opinion, I disagree with this because highly price of oil leads to other problems such as financial problem and impact to food price, moreover, we can heal their environment by other ways.The negative effects of increasing the cost of vehciles fuels are improtant to human life. The significant points is price of basic requirements, for instance, foods and medicines which have to transportation by trucks that use oil fuels for movement. The expensive fuels increase business costs, so their products price are rising up. Futhermore, social problems follow by financial problems. When poor people do not have money but they still hunger, they will steal some food or water this situation roads to social problems.Other ways to reduce environment problems, the causes of this problem are not only fossil fuel but also agricultural or industial aspect which we have to focus on. Intustial areas are the top areas that make lot of pollutions such as air pollution, water pollution from thier procesing and chemical pollution which they use during process. Those of them lead to many problems and effect to qulity of human life. Moveover agricultural areas, there produce many of gas which result to global warming.In conclusion, the increasing car fuels might reduce some of environmental problems but also have drawback to population life. We should to chooce other ways to protect enviromant without effect to our life.;"Environmental issues are a significant concern for society, and one of the major contributors to these problems is the byproduct of fossil fuels. Some suggest that raising the price of fuel can help mitigate the negative impacts of fossil fuel use. However, I disagree with this approach, as higher fuel prices can lead to other complications, such as financial strain and increased food costs. Moreover, there are alternative methods to address environmental concerns.The negative consequences of rising fuel prices are crucial to human well-being. One of the key issues is the cost of essential goods, such as food and medicine, which are transported by trucks powered by fossil fuels. When fuel expenses rise, businesses face higher operational costs, ultimately leading to increased prices for consumers. Additionally, this can trigger social issues: when low-income individuals struggle to afford necessities, they may resort to desperate measures, such as stealing food or water, which can lead to broader social unrest.It is important to recognize that environmental problems stem from more than just fossil fuels; agricultural and industrial practices also play significant roles. Industrial areas are often primary sources of pollution, contributing to air and water contamination through emissions and chemical processes. These pollutants adversely affect human health and quality of life. Furthermore, agricultural practices can generate greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.In conclusion, while increasing fuel prices might help alleviate certain environmental issues, it also poses significant challenges to people's lives. We should explore alternative strategies for protecting the environment that do not adversely affect our livelihoods."
135;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that school children should not be given homework by their teachers, whereas others argue that homework plays an important role in the education of children.Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The issue that whether teachers should assign homework or not has attracted great attention recently.Some people believe that homework is a good way to consolidate students'learning effect.However,others argue that homework exerts huge pressure on students,which is bad for their long-term development.As for me,appropriate homework should be seen as the better choice.I will explain my idea from two aspects.Firstly,homework could examine student's learning results.After teaching the basic content,giving some homework is important to consolidate the knowledge.As an old saying goes,practice makes things perfect.Only doing many practices,can we master the knowledge proficiently.There is an example.In my teaching experiences,I found the students finishing their homework better would achieve higher scores in final examination,while those who couldn't finish their ordinary homework would gain lower grades in any examination.And my translation skills were also improved by practicing the homework from my guiders who gave the targeted examination to me.Secondly,too much homework will cause so many negative effects,such as making students tired very much,causing their depressed mood and their bored emotion.For example,my brother's daughter always suffered from the huge homework which was assigned by his Chinese teacher.She once complained with me that everyday she felt tired and bored after finishing Chinese teacher's assignments.So appropriate homework is reasonable for most students and those ideas that the more homework,the better students' scores ,are wrong to certain extent.Sometimes huge homework is the reason that why some students'scores are reduced.In sum,removing homework is not an ideal option for student's improvement in learning,and reasonable homework provides us a better way to deal with the problem.That is to say,we should strike a balance between assigning homework and removing homework.;"The debate over whether teachers should assign homework has garnered significant attention recently. Some individuals argue that homework is an effective method for reinforcing students' learning, while others contend that it places excessive pressure on students, negatively impacting their long-term development. Personally, I believe that appropriately assigned homework is the better option, and I will outline my reasoning in two key points.First, homework serves as a valuable tool for assessing students' understanding of the material. After teaching fundamental concepts, assigning homework is essential for solidifying that knowledge. As the saying goes, ""practice makes perfect."" Mastery of any subject requires ample practice. For instance, in my teaching experience, I observed that students who diligently completed their homework tended to achieve higher scores on final exams, whereas those who struggled to keep up with regular assignments often received lower grades. Additionally, my own translation skills improved significantly through the targeted exercises my instructors provided.Secondly, excessive homework can lead to various negative consequences, such as overwhelming students, inducing feelings of fatigue, and fostering boredom. For example, my niece often complains about the heavy workload her Chinese teacher assigns, expressing that she feels exhausted and uninterested after completing those tasks. This illustrates that a moderate amount of homework is preferable; the belief that more homework necessarily leads to better outcomes is flawed to some extent. In fact, an overload of assignments can be a contributing factor to declining academic performance.In conclusion, eliminating homework altogether is not a viable solution for enhancing students' learning. Instead, assigning reasonable amounts of homework offers a more effective approach to addressing this issue. We must strive to find a balance between providing homework and minimizing its burden on students."
525;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child's development while others think that it is important for children to go to school.Discuss the advantages of both methods and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In regards to the notion 'it is important for children to go to school', there are two contrasting opinions of supporting it and also disagreeing with it. Schools are conceptually thought to be essential and compulsory for many parents while others may not despite of what the society says.There are people who suggest that going to school is indeed necessary for children and students as it enables them to develop social ability and make friends which will ultimately be useful in the future. Attending school, a microsom of society, itself already teaches young students how to interact with other people ouside of family tree. Those who did not attend school when they were young may have severly low EQ or lacking interaction ability. For instance, an adult who was studying at home might not know how to respect and share objects with others. By being enrolled in a school, children can make remarkable childhood memories that may help them in the future when they are in a slump or depression.On the other hand, some people may disagree to this notion as they think studying at home is far more effective. Their argument might be that going to school would be a waste of time as children usually play around at school. Teaching children can be much more efficient as transportation time and playing time can be eliminatied by not going to school. Furthermore, as children do not have to go out, there will not be any conflicts on bullying or fight with friends. They will not fall onto deviation such as smoking, drinking et cetera which are usually encountered at school due to bad friends. Also, money can be saved by teaching at home as uniforms, for example, do not have to purchased.All in all, although young students might have number of advantages by not going to school, it is nevertheless more important to attend school in a daily basis to improve their social ability and interaction with other people.;"When considering the idea that ""it is important for children to attend school,"" there are two opposing perspectives: those who support the notion and those who challenge it. For many parents, schools are seen as essential and mandatory, while others may hold different views, irrespective of societal expectations.Proponents of school attendance argue that it is crucial for children’s development. Schools provide a vital environment for fostering social skills and friendships, which can prove beneficial later in life. By engaging with peers in a school setting, children learn essential interaction skills that extend beyond their family circles. For instance, individuals who were homeschooled in their youth may struggle with emotional intelligence or social engagement. An adult who studied at home might have difficulty sharing and respecting others' belongings. Additionally, attending school creates significant childhood memories that can support individuals during challenging times later on.Conversely, some people disagree with the importance of formal schooling, believing that home education can be more effective. They contend that school often becomes a distraction, with children spending time playing rather than learning. By homeschooling, parents can streamline education, eliminating travel and recreational time. Furthermore, keeping children at home may reduce the likelihood of conflicts such as bullying or fights with peers. It can also help prevent exposure to negative influences like smoking and drinking, which some associate with school environments. Additionally, financial savings can be achieved by avoiding costs associated with uniforms and transportation.In conclusion, while there are several arguments in favor of education at home, the benefits of attending school regularly to enhance social skills and interactions with others are ultimately more significant."
323;Write about the following topic.Some people believe women are better leaders than men. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is argued by some individuals that men aren't skilled enough as women in regard to leadership. This essay disagrees with the given statement as leadership skills are not depending on gender but are strongly related to people's personality and work experience.The role of a leader should not be stereotyped according to gender, for example, women might be considered more powerful than men because they could normally appear more organised and perfectionist. Indeed, several studies concerning leadership and the role of the leader, have demonstrated that some people have innate attitudes of a leader regardless of their gender. Some of those attitudes are related to active listening, emotional intelligence skills and great communication abilities. Thus, if effectively developed and fostered, those skills can support individuals to achieve higher roles in leadership and management.In the same way, the working experience also plays a crucial role in determining and further developing leadership skills. For example, a large number of women are still renouncing to their career paths in order to care for their families. Indeed, most of the women, apply for part-time roles which do not offer the opportunity to achieve a leadership role despite their abilities. For this reason, is difficult to affirm if women are better than men in leadership.To conclude, the role of a leader is shaped by innate characteristics and people's personalities regardless of their gender. Moreover, the poor presence of women employed in leadership roles does not create pieces of evidence to support such a point of view.;Some individuals argue that men are less skilled than women when it comes to leadership. This essay contests that view, asserting that leadership skills are not determined by gender but rather influenced by personality traits and work experience.Leadership should not be pigeonholed according to gender. For instance, women may be perceived as more competent than men due to their tendencies to be more organized and detail-oriented. Numerous studies on leadership have indicated that certain individuals possess inherent leadership qualities, irrespective of their gender. Key attributes such as active listening, emotional intelligence, and strong communication skills can be found in both men and women. When nurtured effectively, these skills can empower individuals to attain leadership and management positions.Furthermore, work experience significantly contributes to both the formation and enhancement of leadership abilities. Many women continue to sacrifice their career aspirations to prioritize family responsibilities. A substantial number of women seek part-time positions that prevent them from attaining leadership roles, despite their potential. Consequently, it is challenging to assert that women are inherently better leaders than men.In summary, the essence of a leader is shaped by intrinsic qualities and individual personalities rather than gender. Additionally, the lack of women in leadership positions does not provide sufficient evidence to support the idea that one gender is superior to the other in leadership capacities.
247;Write about the following topic.Some people feel that manufacturers and supermarkets have the responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging of goods. Others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Packing of goods has become a noticeable issue nowadays, especially in terms of environmental concerns and sustainable development of society. In order to reduce the amount of packaging, some people believe that manufacturers and supermarkets are more responsible for taking measures, while others insist that customers play a more critical role in reality. In my view, the effort needs to be made by the supplier and the consumer both to guarantee the achievement of the goal.On the one hand, the problem of over-packaging is often caused by commercial strategy. The supplier attempts to use beautiful packaging to make their products more attractive to customers. It is fairly easy to imagine that people would be more likely to choose a product decorated gorgeously than the same one with a plain appearance provided that there is thus no significant increase in price. Following that, producers would try to make every effort to obtain more competitive packaging for their products, which probably leads to excessive use of the wrap. Therefore, it is undoubtedly the duty of the producer to partake in reducing the amount of over-packaging by finding another way to improve the competitiveness of their products instead of merely attaching more value to their appearance.On the other hand, the behaviors of customers give rise to over-packaging as well. The more attention that people will pay to the appearance of goods, the more encouraged producers will be to exert themselves on wrapping. Moreover, the public awareness about the harmful influence of over-packaging is also profound in decreasing the amount of packaging. As customers take the problems caused by over-packaging into account, they would be more willing to purchase the goods with less packaging, which is a highly practical way to prevent producers from wrapping unduly.In conclusion, it is clear that suppliers and customers both are responsible for the trend of over-packaging. Therefore, the success of altering the situation needs the participation of them both.;The issue of product packaging has become increasingly prominent, especially regarding environmental concerns and the sustainable development of society. To reduce packaging waste, some argue that manufacturers and supermarkets should take primary responsibility, while others believe that consumers play a crucial role. In my opinion, both suppliers and customers must collaborate to achieve meaningful change.On one hand, over-packaging often stems from commercial strategies. Suppliers use attractive packaging to entice customers, and it’s easy to see how consumers would prefer a beautifully packaged product over a plain one, assuming the price remains similar. As a result, producers strive to create more eye-catching packaging, which can lead to excessive wrapping. Therefore, it is imperative for manufacturers to explore alternative methods for enhancing their products' appeal without resorting to excessive packaging.On the other hand, consumer behavior contributes significantly to the problem of over-packaging. The greater the emphasis customers place on product aesthetics, the more motivated producers will be to invest in elaborate packaging. Furthermore, raising public awareness about the negative effects of over-packaging can help diminish its prevalence. When consumers consider the implications of excessive packaging, they may be more inclined to choose products with minimal wrapping, providing a practical way to encourage manufacturers to reduce their packaging efforts.In conclusion, it is evident that both suppliers and consumers share responsibility for the trend of over-packaging. Consequently, addressing this issue requires the active involvement of both parties.
181;Write about the following topic.Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding change. Others, however, think that change is always a good thing.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people rather doing the same things over and over avoiding change, meanwhile others consider change as a positive thing. Some people are probably afraid of change and for this reason they prefer staying in the confort zone because it's something familiar. On the other hand, others believe that change is a good opportunity to grow and discover new things.Changing it's not for everybody, because there are people that doesn't like it, so they try to avoid it. Spending the whole life doing the same thing is not as bad as change for some people. This is probably linked to the fact that sometime change is something unknown. So, sometime people prefere to stay in their confort zone because even if it's not the best at least is something familiar. For example, people that hate their jobs but are stuck with it, is because they're too afraid to change it and land in a worse place or position. So they rather stay in that place because they're too afraid to lose it and end up worse. I believe that this is an understandable and common reason around people, however i believe that change can give more chances for improvement.Other people believes that change is always a positive thing. Changing is an opportunity to grow and discover new things, It's a chance to achieve something better and improve. There are people who doesn't like to be in the same place (phisically, economically or emotionally) and prefer changing. For instance, going to a new country because the idea of living in the same place forever is not charming enough, so find out new places to see, and places to feel confortable ,emotionally and economically for instance, is something that only people who are hungry enough of change would do it. I believe that sometime it's better risk it than live the same life everyday.In conclusion, the preference about change depends on people and wheter is beneficial or not depends on the different point of views and situations. I think, that change is important, everything change even if try to avoid it. So, it's better embrace it because no matter how things go it will leave you either with an experiece or with a lesson. So, in my opinion change is a good thing.;"Some individuals prefer to stick to familiar routines and resist change, viewing it as something to avoid. In contrast, others see change as a positive opportunity for growth and exploration. Fear of the unknown may drive some to remain in their comfort zones, where they feel secure. For them, the idea of spending their lives doing the same things isn’t as daunting as facing the uncertainties that change brings. This inclination to avoid change often stems from a fear of ending up in a worse situation. For example, many individuals endure jobs they dislike simply because they fear that seeking something better may lead to greater dissatisfaction. While this rationale is understandable and common, I believe that embracing change can lead to greater opportunities for personal growth.On the other hand, many people view change as inherently positive. They see it as a chance to grow, discover new experiences, and achieve better outcomes. For these individuals, being stagnant—whether physically, financially, or emotionally—is unappealing. They seek out new adventures, such as relocating to a different country, driven by the desire to explore new environments and create a more fulfilling life. It takes a certain hunger for change to pursue such transformations, but I believe it’s often worth the risk to avoid living the same life day after day.In conclusion, attitudes toward change vary from person to person, and its benefits often depend on individual perspectives and circumstances. I believe that change is essential; everything evolves, whether we like it or not. Embracing change can lead to valuable experiences and lessons, so I view change as a fundamentally positive force."
149;Write about the following topic.Some people think living in big cities is bad for people’s health.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In the past decades, the rise of urbanization has brought trends of moving into the cities. While some people believe that the availability of resources and welfare in metropolises can outweigh the unhealthy environment, I strongly believe that the fancy infrastructures come in exchange for health sacrifice.To begin with, most megacities are overpopulated. With scarce resources and higher demands in every aspect, products and services received in these bustling locations usually come at a higher price, lower quality and longer waiting time. For example, it could take up to weeks or months to queue up for non-urgent medical services while it takes only a few days or even without booking in non-busy areas. Moreover, the nature of crowded areas accelerates the spreading of transmittable diseases during the pandemic.Another undeniable health factor for those residing in cities is pollution. Most cities come with traffic issues where there are exceeding amounts of cars which create air pollution. It is proved that, in long term, smog in the air could result in respiratory diseases such as lung cancer. Furthermore, the number of the city's population is equal to the extremely large amount of waste and without an appropriate waste management system, it could lead to several more problems. One of them is pests such as mice and bugs which are the perfect mediums for severe diseases such as rabies.All in all, urbanization has tremendous benefits to human society as a whole and is unavoidable in the present context. Thus, governments should focus on addressing these issues to ensure the sustainable progress of cities and the citizens' quality of life.;"Over the past few decades, urbanization has led to a significant trend of migration toward cities. While some individuals argue that the resources and opportunities available in urban areas outweigh the potential downsides of living in an unhealthy environment, I firmly contend that the allure of modern infrastructure comes at the cost of our health.Firstly, many megacities are facing severe overpopulation. With limited resources and heightened demand, products and services in these bustling urban centers often come with higher costs, reduced quality, and longer wait times. For instance, accessing non-urgent medical services can involve waiting weeks or even months, whereas in less crowded regions, such services might be available within days or without prior appointment. Additionally, the densely packed nature of cities accelerates the spread of contagious diseases, especially during pandemics.Another significant health concern for city dwellers is pollution. Urban areas frequently grapple with traffic congestion, leading to air pollution caused by a high volume of vehicles. Research indicates that prolonged exposure to smog can contribute to serious respiratory illnesses, including lung cancer. Moreover, the large populations in cities generate vast amounts of waste; without effective waste management systems, communities face numerous challenges, including infestations of pests like rodents and insects, which can carry serious diseases such as rabies.In conclusion, while urbanization presents considerable advantages to society and is an inevitable phenomenon in today’s world, it is crucial for governments to tackle these pressing issues. By doing so, they can ensure sustainable urban development and enhance the quality of life for city residents."

When we look around, we can see its presence everywhere. However, some individuals believe that art classes in schools are a waste of time and that teachers should prioritize subjects like science. On the other hand, many argue that art education is just as important as math, science, and language. This article will thoroughly explain the reasons why art should be an integral part of children's education.It is widely understood that reading, writing, and mathematics are critical subjects for children to focus on during their school years. While this perspective has merit, subjects like art, music, and poetry also hold substantial importance in our lives. For instance, scientists suggest that engaging with art can foster a child's creativity and help teachers identify gifted students. Moreover, children express themselves in various ways; for some, art serves as a more effective outlet for their emotions. This capability can enhance understanding between teachers, parents, and children, and can also bolster children's confidence in their studies.In conclusion, while many parents view the primary goal of education as the acquisition of skills in reading, writing, math, and science, it is essential to recognize the value of art classes. Allocating time for subjects like art allows children to discover and develop their unique talents."

I strongly disagree with this opinion. I think that state policy cannot lead to the people's obesity. Moreover, I am sure that only parents are responsible for their children diseases.First of all, it is important to say that government's actions can not be followed with the obesity. It is responsible only for control that all available products are not dangerous for people's health. Food that consist of a lot of fats do not put your health under the threat after the first consumption. Only overeating of this kind of food can be harmful for your health leading obesity. For instance, there is no government's responsibility if you go to the mall and buy 6 cans of beer providing health problem for yourself. I am sure that government is responsible only for making 1 can of beer acceptable for your health.Secondly, children's actions and potential consequences of these actions should be controlled by their parents. Obesity can be a result of a permanent overeating. Because of their age, chilldren cannot control themselves. That is why this responsibility goes on their parents. As it was mentioned before, there is no product that can be harmful for the healh after the first and the only consumption. There is no reason to condemn government because of the permanent consumption of any products. For example, child could eat 3 pieces of cake insted of 1 just because of his wish. In this case, his parents should stop him after the first one to avoid potential obesity.In conclusion, I would like to say that I do not see any reasons to say that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children. It has no responsibility for people's overeating and lack of parents' control over their children.;"It is often suggested that the government is to blame for the increasing rates of obesity in children. I strongly disagree with this perspective. I believe that state policies do not cause obesity in individuals. Instead, I maintain that parents bear the primary responsibility for their children's health issues.Firstly, it is crucial to acknowledge that government actions are not a direct cause of obesity. The government's role is primarily to ensure that all available food products are safe for public consumption. Foods high in fat do not pose an immediate health risk after a single intake; rather, it is the consistent overeating of these foods that can lead to obesity. For example, if someone chooses to buy six cans of beer at a mall, any resulting health issues are their own responsibility, not the government's. The government's duty is limited to ensuring that any single can of beer is safe to consume.Secondly, parents must oversee their children's eating habits and the potential consequences of those habits. Obesity often arises from habitual overeating, which younger children may struggle to regulate on their own. Therefore, parents must take charge of their children's dietary choices. As stated earlier, no food item is inherently harmful after just one consumption. It is unreasonable to hold the government accountable for ongoing overconsumption of any product. For instance, if a child opts to eat three pieces of cake instead of just one, it is the parents' responsibility to intervene and limit their intake to prevent potential weight gain.In conclusion, I see no valid reason to hold the government accountable for the rise in childhood obesity. The responsibility for overeating and inadequate parental supervision lies squarely with individuals and families, not with state authorities."

But others think taking part in individual sports is better, like swimming. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"There are lots of benifits in both party of sports which is group sports and individual sports. Many argue that one is better than another. By analyzing my personal experience, both side advantages and disadvanteges will be discussed.Health, the main factor that make people doing the sport in some extent. Many sports help body to increase the metabolism and keep our figure look slim. For example, like swiming, the sport is well-known for beauty body buidling, many reaserch show that water pressure form muscle into more dynamic beautiful shape than any other sport regardless of safty issues which part of events were practice in open water.Compare to swiming, a group sport like soccer game need 22 players participate into the field. Average soccer player have very powerful core strenth, in order to compete in this match, soccer player need to wear certain protection to prevent from injury such as foot pad to reduce the impact from side kick from other players and ankel protector. Undoubtly, soccer players have most strong body among many sports. However, they are the group of people most likely get injuryed more frequently.Sport also can build trust and friendship between people. In this aspect, both individual sports and group sports are proven that partipating in group games or competing with another player on a 1v1 match can increase the improvement of sportsmanship between people. Like olympic motto, ""stonger, faster and higher"", a good sport can bring people together and compete each other in a fair and friendly enviornment. However, individual sport may get boring faster than group sports due to lack of competition.In conclusion, neither group sports nor individual sports are perfect in every aspects. It is important to found a sport suit for each individual personal interest. All kinds of sports always carry benifits with dangerous if people do not do it well.";"Both team sports and individual sports offer a variety of benefits, and there is an ongoing debate about which is superior. Drawing from my own experiences, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both types.Health is a major factor motivating individuals to engage in sports to some degree. Many athletic activities can boost metabolism and help individuals maintain a slim physique. For instance, swimming is renowned for its ability to sculpt a beautiful body; numerous studies indicate that the water’s resistance shapes muscles more effectively than many other sports, notwithstanding safety concerns that arise during open-water events.In contrast, team sports like soccer require the participation of 22 players on the field. A typical soccer player possesses exceptional core strength, as competing in such matches demands specific protective gear to minimize the risk of injuries, such as shin pads to absorb impacts from kicks and ankle braces for protection. While soccer players tend to have some of the strongest physiques in sports, they are also more susceptible to injuries due to the nature of the game.Sports also foster trust and friendship among participants. In this regard, both individual and team activities contribute to sportsmanship, whether through team games or one-on-one competitions. Adhering to the Olympic motto, ""Faster, Higher, Stronger,"" sports can unite individuals and encourage fair and friendly competition. However, individual sports may become monotonous more quickly than team sports due to the lack of competition and camaraderie.In conclusion, neither team sports nor individual sports are flawless in all aspects. It is crucial for individuals to find a sport that aligns with their personal interests. Regardless of the type, every sport carries its own set of benefits and risks, especially if not practiced safely."

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people argue that students who have noticeable abilities and nice educational skills in academics should be separated during the learning process. The other says that it is no object who a better in education who not they should study together. I believe that it is terrible idea to include separation among students.On the one hand, when students with strong and weak academic abilities educate separately, teachers could control the learning process more thoroughly. In this way the teacher could give them more difficult tasks and focus on really relevant topics. A good example of this are private schools with fees and entering exams. It is the fact that there students in final classes have better knowledge than in common schools.On the other hand, when students with different skills educate together the strong students will help weak ones. In these classes there are standards and all students should follow them and there are opportunities to ask schoolmates how to solve some task correctly. The nice example of this is my school. If I did not know how to solve a task I would have a chance to wait for help from my more wise mate.In conclusion, although separate education will give a chance to learn a lot of difficult tasks and it helps teachers, the losing way of asking help if you do not know how to solve the task would be devastating for the educational process. In addition, it could be separated by abilities and wisdom, anyway it is an awful idea.;"Some individuals contend that students with prominent academic talents and strong educational skills should be separated during the learning process. Others argue that it doesn't matter who excels in education; all students should study together. I believe that separating students is a detrimental approach.On one hand, when students with varying academic abilities are taught separately, teachers can manage the learning process more effectively. This allows educators to assign more challenging tasks and concentrate on relevant topics. A good example of this is seen in private schools that require tuition and entrance exams; students in their final years often possess a deeper understanding of the material compared to those in public schools.On the other hand, when students with diverse skills learn together, stronger students can assist their peers who may be struggling. In these inclusive classes, there are established standards that all students are expected to meet, and opportunities to seek help from classmates when tackling difficult problems arise. For instance, in my school, if I faced a challenging task, I could count on a more knowledgeable classmate to help me understand it.In conclusion, while separate education may allow for the exploration of more complex tasks and ease teachers' workloads, the loss of opportunities for students to seek assistance from peers would be detrimental to the educational experience. Ultimately, categorizing students by ability is an unwise idea."
569;Write about the following topic.Some teachers think that international student exchange would be beneficial for all teenage school students.Do you think its advantages will outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The international student exchange is getting more popular in many high schools in big cities. This operation brings many advantages which would be beneficial for teenager students. Though, here some disadvantages still exist.Firstly, I think one of disadvantages is that lack of supervision on the international exchange teenagers as they are living in other countries. In general speaking, the youths felt strange and inadaptable at initial period. They can’t speak well foreign language, can’t communicate well with other classmates or teachers, so they might feel alone and isolate from a new circumstance. If they can’t adjust themselves well to fit in with groups as soon as possible, they will encounter more difficult things, such as studying, social and daily routine. The worse situation is that they might give up their studying, even they will mislead them into crime.On the contrary, the advantages are far more than disadvantages. For example, youths will extend their horizons. They will see and know many new things what they never seen in domestic. They would easily accept those new things than adults, because youths have curiosities all long. Furthermore, the teenagers easier to make new friends in other countries, because they are always passion and single-minded. In order to communicate with different background students from all over the world, they must cultivate their social capacities harder than before. It is the best way to elevate their skills of the foreign language is communication. Moreover, through the different viewpoint collisions the international exchange students have gained multiple and scientific logics, which will have a profound impact at the rest their lives. However, I think the simplest advantage is that most the international exchange students have possessed with an excellent foreign language ability after then come back.At the end of my essay, I think it is not suit for all teenagers to be the international exchange students. Here the teenagers must accept some selection processes under the fair and effective principles.;The popularity of international student exchanges is steadily increasing in high schools throughout major cities. This program offers numerous benefits that can greatly aid teenagers. However, it is important to acknowledge some potential drawbacks as well.One primary concern is the lack of supervision for teenagers participating in international exchanges, as they find themselves in unfamiliar countries. Initially, young people often experience feelings of strangeness and difficulty adjusting. Language barriers can hinder their ability to communicate with classmates and teachers, which may lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation. If they struggle to integrate into their new environment swiftly, they may face challenges related to academics, social interactions, and daily life. In the worst-case scenario, this could lead to disengagement from their studies or even pushing them toward negative behaviors.On the other hand, the advantages of these exchanges significantly outweigh the disadvantages. For one, students have the opportunity to broaden their perspectives and encounter experiences they might never have had back home. Young people, being naturally curious, are often more receptive to new ideas than adults. Additionally, teenagers typically find it easier to forge friendships with peers from diverse backgrounds, as they are open-minded and enthusiastic. To effectively communicate with students from around the globe, they must develop their social skills more than ever before, and one of the best ways to enhance their foreign language abilities is through practical communication. Furthermore, interacting with different viewpoints during the exchange fosters critical thinking and diverse reasoning that can have a lasting impact on their lives. A notable advantage is that many students return home with advanced foreign language proficiency.In conclusion, I believe that being an international exchange student is not suitable for all teenagers. It is essential that participants undergo a selection process that is both fair and effective.
1003;Write about the following topic.Some universities now offer their courses on the Internet so that people can study online.Is this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It has become a popular trend that many universities have sent online courses for people to acquire knowledge through the Internet, which makes it more and more available for people to gain valuable resources and improve themselves. From my perspective, such a trend contains much benefits and it is undoubtedly a positive development.On the one hand, people can have more access to their interested expertise and delve into related fields with the help of online courses offered by universities. It is comparatively hard and inconvenient for people to attend courses in the university if they are not college students. Luckily, with myriads of online courses which are usually free and of high quality, learners merely need to register and sign in to find out some interesting courses ranging from academic knowledge to practical skills, which can afford a challenging but exciting experience for those attend the lessons.On the other hand, it is a good way for the universities to improve the quality of the courses as well as make some adaptation to the content of the courses. In order for people outside the universities to acquire knowldege effectively, online courses should cater to people's preference to some extent. It is expectable that some courses which is of great necessity and closely connected with people's daily life would be popular. Thus, universities would therefore release more high-quality courses by innovating teaching skills to meet people's needs.In conlusion, I think online courses provided by universities can surely make a positive impact on society because people who have the desire to acquire knowledge can enjoy sufficient resources without boundaries, which enhances individual's rights to grasp knowledge and facilitates the improvement of higher education in the long run.;The trend of universities offering online courses has gained immense popularity, granting individuals the opportunity to access knowledge through the Internet.

They enable those eager to learn to access ample resources without limitations, thereby promoting individual rights to knowledge and fostering the long-term advancement of higher education.
531;Write about the following topic.The issue of gay marriage remains controversial. Some people think that this trend has adverse effects on the society while others believe that it is seen as a natural trend and right for people to choose this type of marriage. Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Recently, many countries have legalized gay marriage. However, there are many people who do not agree with that, and claim that it has a bad influence on the education of children, and the evolution of society. However, in my opinion, I think it is a good opportunity for homosexual people as they are now understood by others, and have the right to have children despite of their situation.To begin, there are many parents, for example, who tend to believe that because of the access to gay marriage, their children will find it normal to fall in love with a person from the same sex. As a result, more and more children will become homosexual, which is unconventional as far as the parents are concerned. However, I believe that it is not because children understand the fact that being gay is normal, that they will be influenced by this. In fact, they will be able to compassionate for people who struggle to express their homosexuality, so they will help them to feel more comfortable with that. Moreover, they will be more open-minded which is very important for children development.Secondly, many other people are convinced that gay marriage will inevitably tends towards a decrease of the young population as gay individuals can not have their own kids. As a consequence, This phenomenon represents a threat because young people will not be able to take over for the future. However, I am not of this opinion. I think that such a decrease in young people population will not occur as the vast majority of the world's population in not homosexual. Moreover, by allowing gay marriage, gay couples will be able to adopt children. Indeed, due to the fact that they are not able to give rise to new-born, they can adopt children who are abandonned, and give them the opportunity to live in a new family with good conditions.To conclude, I firmly believe that gay marriage is a good opportunity for the development of the society. Indeed, not only it makes children more open-minded, which is important for their own development, but also gives for those who are unfortunately abandonned, a safe environment to thrive in.;In recent years, numerous countries have legalized same-sex marriage. Despite this progress, there remain individuals who oppose it, arguing that it negatively impacts children's education and societal development. However, I see this as a significant opportunity for the LGBTQ+ community, as it promotes understanding and grants same-sex couples the right to raise children.Many parents fear that the acceptance of gay marriage will lead their children to perceive same-sex relationships as normal, which they believe might increase the number of children identifying as homosexual. Yet, I contend that teaching children that being gay is acceptable does not compel them to adopt that identity. Instead, it cultivates empathy and support for those who struggle with their sexual orientation, helping them to feel more accepted. Additionally, this awareness fosters a more open-minded generation, which is crucial for healthy development.Furthermore, some argue that legalizing gay marriage will lead to a decline in the younger population because same-sex couples cannot naturally conceive children. They believe this poses a threat to future generations. However, I disagree. The majority of the population is heterosexual, and thus, a significant decrease in the youth demographic is unlikely. Moreover, same-sex couples are granted the opportunity to adopt children. By welcoming adopted children—many of whom are in need of loving homes—they can provide a nurturing environment and a chance for stability.In conclusion, I strongly believe that same-sex marriage represents a positive step forward for society. It not only encourages children to embrace open-mindedness, essential for their growth, but also offers a safe and supportive environment for abandoned children to flourish.
293;Write about the following topic.The most important function of music is that it helps people reduce stress. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many today have come to the conclusion that the most significant effect on people of music is to relieve stress. While I agree that music also has more important positive functions other than reducing stress.On the one hand, I have to admit that music is a good way to reduce stress and it do plays an important role in our daily life. A good example of this can be seen in Shanghai, where has a large number of single karaoke rooms in the office buildings. As we all know, compared to the others cities in China, the people living in Shanghai face more stress, like the surprisingly high price of house and the fierce competition of work. Those public karaoke rooms, which were provided by the government for the public, become a good place for people to enjoy the music and have fun.On the other hand, for many people, music is an ideal career to persue in their life, like the job as an accountant, which can bring them with incomes and improve their living standard. For example, the TV programs related to music attract more and more people to participate in, like The Voice. Most of the participants wish to show their excellent peformance in music through these stages with the purpose of having access to more business opportunities and making more money at the same time. It is undeniable that the following income would be exponential increased than before if they succeed finally.In conclusion, it is not doubt that music is very essential for us, not only for its spiritual meanings, but also for its more important role in our society which could allow the person to relise their dream while creating more economical benefits.;Many people today believe that the primary benefit of music is its ability to alleviate stress. While I agree that stress relief is significant, I also contend that music serves even more vital functions.On one hand, it’s clear that music is an effective means of stress reduction and plays a crucial role in our daily lives. For instance, in Shanghai, there are numerous solo karaoke rooms in office buildings. Unlike other cities in China, residents of Shanghai often face higher levels of stress due to exorbitant housing prices and intense job competition. These public karaoke facilities, made available by the government, provide a space for individuals to unwind and enjoy music.On the other hand, for many, music represents a fulfilling career path. Similar to careers in fields like accounting, a musical profession can offer both financial stability and an improved quality of life. Television programs focused on music, such as The Voice, are drawing increasing participation. Many contestants hope to showcase their talents and access greater business opportunities, ultimately leading to increased income if they succeed.In conclusion, it is undeniable that music is essential to our lives, not only for its emotional and psychological benefits but also for its significant role in our society, enabling individuals to realize their dreams while generating economic advantages.
925;Write about the following topic.The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Traffic in cities is now a major public health problem. Finding solutions to reduce traffic is very crucial. I totally agree that if people travel less from home to work or to education or even for shopping can reduce the amount of traffic. With the covid 19 outbreak pandemic we saw how much the working from home and using the zoom application for studying reduced the traffic in cities. People now are using online for shopping too. We know that traffic can be reduced if less consumers are using the roads. However, I dont agree that this is the only way to reduce traffic. Other strategies to reduce traffic are :1. Planning the roads and building the road bridges in a smarter way with special lanes for public transportation.2. Encourging people to use light trails, public transportations and to use car pools.3. Building special lanes for motorcycles and electric bikes.4. The governoment can put more regulations regarding how many cars each family can have.5. Increasing the vehicles prices and reduce the public transportation tickets.6. Educate people on the consequences of traffic and how it can inadverntly affect their life.7. Encourge people to walk more and to choose a work that is close to your home.As I mentioned above there are many strategies that can help in reducing tranffic and only by reducing the need for people to travel from home. I think i people travel less it abviously can reduce the traffic but we need a multi strategy with the collaberations of many sectors to successfly reduce traffic in cities.;Traffic congestion in urban areas has become a significant public health issue, making it essential to find effective solutions for its reduction. I firmly believe that reducing the frequency with which people travel—whether for work, education, or shopping—can significantly lessen traffic volume. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated this when remote work and online learning through platforms like Zoom contributed to decreased city traffic. Similarly, more people have turned to online shopping, which further reduces the number of cars on the road.While it’s clear that fewer consumers lead to less traffic, I don’t believe this is the only way to address the issue. Here are other strategies to consider:1. Smart road planning and the construction of bridges with designated lanes for public transportation can optimize traffic flow.2. Encouraging the use of light rails, public transit, and carpooling can help alleviate road congestion.3. Developing dedicated lanes for motorcycles and electric bicycles can facilitate safer and more efficient travel.4. The government could implement regulations limiting the number of vehicles allowed per household.5. Increasing vehicle prices while lowering public transport fares could incentivize the use of shared transportation options.6. Raising public awareness about the impacts of traffic congestion and how it affects daily life is essential for long-term change.7. Promoting walking and encouraging individuals to find jobs closer to home can also contribute to traffic reduction.As I mentioned, there are numerous strategies that can effectively reduce traffic, beyond simply minimizing the need for travel. While reducing personal travel can help alleviate congestion, a multi-faceted approach that involves collaboration across various sectors is necessary for successfully addressing traffic issues in cities.
235;Write about the following topic.There are several factors that motivate people to stay in the workforce, and money is the most important reason/factor. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The topic of motivation for work has merely failed to be discussed. Someone elaborate that the most significant factor is money while others suppose it is not. As far as I am concerned, although money is of great importance, it cannot always be the most valuable one.Undoubtedly, money can be a crucial factor to diminish the financial burden of families, especially for those who were born in a poverty-stricken area. To be more specific, only by earning sufficient money can they raise their later generations and keep the elderly. Provided that they cannot find a decent job that allow them to own some disposable money, it would add insult to injury.However, there are a great number of factors that may be considered as worthwhile to be the motivation of stay in the staff by some people. First of all, being in the workforce can help to strengthen an individual’s interpersonal skills. It is widely acknowledged that there are a colossal number of activities as well as team programmes that require people to collaborate, compromise and compete with the others. Thus, individuals will tend to learn some social skills and become gregarious and sociable, which can help them better adapt themselves to the mainstream society. In addition, people may also get a chance to broaden their horizons and lay a firm basis for future development by staying in the workforce. For instance, under the circumstance that numerous companies may provide the staff with the opportunity to go abroad and get involved in some international programs, people are able to get access to different cultures. As a result, people can develop panning-for-gold thinking rather than sponge-feeding thinking in the process of understanding divergent cultures, which can be beneficial for their future careers.In conclusion, although money is valuable for individuals to be in the workforce, there are many other factors that cannot be overlooked. Only by treating all the factors rationally can we enjoy the pleasure rather than pressure.;The issue of work motivation has rarely been thoroughly examined. Some argue that money is the primary motivator, while others disagree. In my view, although financial compensation is significant, it is not always the most important factor.It is clear that money plays a vital role in alleviating the financial stress of families, particularly for those who come from impoverished backgrounds. Specifically, adequate earnings are essential for individuals to support their families and care for the elderly. If they struggle to find stable employment that offers sufficient disposable income, the situation becomes even more challenging.Nevertheless, numerous other factors can motivate individuals to remain employed. First and foremost, being part of the workforce can enhance an individual's interpersonal skills. It is widely recognized that many roles involve collaborative activities and team initiatives that require cooperation, compromise, and competition. Consequently, individuals often develop valuable social skills and become more outgoing, which aids their integration into society.Additionally, staying in the workforce can provide opportunities for personal growth and future advancement. For instance, many organizations offer employees the chance to travel abroad and participate in international programs, allowing them to experience diverse cultures. This exposure fosters a mindset geared towards exploration and understanding, rather than merely absorbing information, ultimately benefiting their future careers.In conclusion, while money is an important factor in motivating individuals to work, many other aspects must be considered. By acknowledging all these factors, we can cultivate a more enjoyable, less pressured work experience.
115;Write about the following topic.To meet the growing need for food to support an increasing population, a country should make use of edible insects as a food source. However, some people believe that insects are not only unhealthy but harvesting them will also negatively affect nature. What are the benefits and drawbacks of eating insects?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some countries and culture already utilize insects as part of food source. As such, it can be relatively inexpensive to consume insects - which are often freely found in certain environments and do not take much skill to be collected, killed and consumed - as compared to the cost and manual labor involved in raising animal livestock, butchering, as well as preparing the meat for consumption. Similarly agriculture also involves consistent manual labor, and has costs associated with it, including for machinery and materials needed. However, people may be against the idea of consuming insects due to the novelty of it, and they may also feel disgust around it. As the prompt states, some may find it unhealthy. Harvesting insects on purpose will also require some physical and psychological work - but the benefit here is that it may be easier than harvesting large animals or cultivating crops.I have never consumed an insect product - and my father has mentioned to me that had lived in such-and-such country, I would not be so scared of cockroaches - viewing them as a food source. He intended this to be an ironic comment, meant to comfor me somewhat due to my strong aversion to cockroaches. However, he may be correct! For individuals socialized in such a society, their aversion to roaches may be lower than mine. Hence, part of the issue here is socialization and accepting this new food norm, should it be novel to the individual and/or the country.I have tried an octopus for the first time when I was around 20 years old - as I was curious about this dish called Takoyaki, and had heard good reviews of it. It was not unpleasant to eat the ocotpus, per se, but I likely will not go back to it. All in all, new experiences, including consumption of new types of food, may create strong aversion at first, but once dip your toes into it, so to speak, it may be tamer than the experience you were expecting - even if you never go back to eating it again.;"Many countries and cultures already incorporate insects into their diets. Consuming insects can be relatively low-cost; they are often readily available in various environments and can be collected, prepared, and eaten with minimal skill, especially in comparison to the expenses and labor involved in raising livestock, butchering, and preparing meat. Similarly, agriculture requires ongoing manual labor and incurs costs for machinery and materials. However, some individuals may oppose the idea of eating insects due to its novelty or feelings of disgust, and others might perceive it as unhealthy. Although intentional insect harvesting involves both physical effort and a mental shift, it may be less demanding than raising large animals or growing crops.Personally, I have never tried an insect product. My father once remarked that if I lived in a different country, I might not be so averse to cockroaches, seeing them instead as a food source. He meant this ironically to comfort me in light of my strong dislike for them. However, he may have a point! People raised in societies where insects are considered food might have a lower aversion to them than I do. Therefore, the challenge lies in socialization and embracing this new food norm, particularly when it is unfamiliar to an individual or a culture.I experienced a similar situation when I first tried octopus at around 20 years old, motivated by curiosity about a dish called Takoyaki that I had heard positive reviews about. While I found the octopus edible, I probably won’t choose to eat it again. Ultimately, new experiences, including trying different foods, can initially evoke strong aversions. However, once you sample them, they may turn out to be less daunting than you anticipated—even if you decide not to revisit them in the future."
131;Write about the following topic.With the improvements in today’s health care, society has to care for more and more elderly people.Do you feel that society will be able to cope with the increase in numbers of elderly people today and how can it be managed?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;I believe that all improvements in health care increase the number of elderly people, but those improvements also brings benefities in an way to care then.First of all, looking for a financial perspective, in generaly way, people became capable to work for a bigger period, getting retired older. So they could contributed more for any pension plan or those kind of program. We need to guarantee that our next governants will be capable to redesign the retire's program in an way to guarantee those beneffits to whole population.Looking by a health care perspective, all the improvments and medicine advance, it brings the possibilite to have a good life even allthough the years.For instance, we can see many people that healed from a bad ill like cancer or other ones and have a good life nowadays.This is the reason that elderly people is not a problem to our society, but in fact their represents more knowledge and we have all tecnology to take care about theirselfs.In other way we can see that our society open more space and are more concern with elderly population. We can see some places speciallyzed to take care of their and also a kind of intertainement focused on them, like some hotels, restauurants, clinics.In whole way our society are looking for treaty our elderly society in a decent way, respect them, make a enviroment friendly for their deficient and any dificult of mobility and any other issue that we need to cope to guarantee their activities.;"I believe that advancements in health care lead to an increase in the elderly population, but these improvements also enhance the way we care for them. From a financial perspective, people are generally able to work longer and retire at an older age. This allows them to contribute more to pension plans and similar programs. It is crucial that our future leaders are equipped to redesign retirement programs to ensure these benefits are accessible to everyone.From a healthcare standpoint, advancements in medicine have enabled many individuals to enjoy fulfilling lives well into their later years. For example, many people have successfully recovered from serious illnesses like cancer and are living vibrant lives today.This is why elderly individuals should not be viewed as a burden on society; rather, they represent a wealth of knowledge and experience. With modern technology, we are well-equipped to meet their needs.Moreover, our society is increasingly accommodating towards the elderly population. There are more specialized facilities designed for their care, as well as entertainment options tailored to them, such as hotels, restaurants, and clinics.Overall, our society is striving to treat the elderly with dignity and respect, creating an environment that is friendly to those with mobility challenges or other health issues, ensuring they can continue to engage in activities they enjoy."
933;Write about the following topic.Young people in the modern world seem to have more power and influence than any previous young generation.Why is this the case?What impact does this have on the relationship between old and young people?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"In modern times, the younger generation appear to be more powerful and influencial compared to the generations in times past. I believe this is as a result of younger people being more ascertive, stepping up to question and change existing societal norms and archaic cultures. At first, this may negatively affect their relationship with the older generation as a result of how unfamiliar they are to these changes but subsequently, the tension is bound to resolve, when the older generations come to accept these changes.To begin with, it is an open truth that young people these days tend to be very bold and outspoken and unlike their predecessors, are better at questioning norms that do not sit right with them and even going an extra mile to change these norms or cultures. A good example of this is seen in women empowerment and rights activism. In my part of the world, some years back, it was believed that a woman's place is in the kitchen and her sole job was to birth and rear children, therefore, women were not allowed to be educated or have paying jobs. Women in the older generation complied to this because it was the norm, but this is not the case in modern times, because many young women opposed to it and now, homes are even headed by women; the power of activism.Many people in the older generation are not familiar with young people being more outspoken and this is understandable because in their time, they were taught to only follow rules and not to question them. Therefore the fact that young people have become more outspoken and powerful is foreign to them and just like every human nature, whatever is foreign or different is automatically hated. As a result, there is likely going to be a tension between the 2 generations, however, with constant advocation and learning the tension is bound to resolve. For example, going back to women's rights activism, at the start, many older people were not on board as they did not think it was normal, however, there are now a lot of older people who have become activists.In conclusion, I believe that the power and influence the younger generation has is as a result of their ascertiveness and will to effect changes in their societies and even though it may cause a negative relationship with the older generation at first, subsequently, their differences is likely to be ironed out when the older generation learns to accept these changes.";In contemporary society, the younger generation seems to wield greater power and influence than those who came before them. This shift can be attributed to young people being more assertive, as they challenge and seek to change outdated societal norms and traditions. Initially, this can create tension between generations due to the unfamiliarity of these changes for older individuals, but over time, such conflicts are likely to be resolved as the older generation learns to embrace the new realities.It is widely recognized that today's youth are bold and outspoken, unlike their predecessors who often adhered to established norms without question. Many young people are actively confronting beliefs that feel outdated and are motivated to change them. A prime example can be seen in the realm of women’s empowerment and rights activism. In my region, it was once commonly accepted that a woman's role was limited to the household, with little emphasis on education or careers. While older women may have accepted this as the norm, today’s young women are challenging these assumptions, and it is now increasingly common to see women leading households and engaging in activism.Older generations may struggle to understand this newfound assertiveness among young people, as they were typically raised to conform to rules rather than to question them. Consequently, the current assertiveness of the younger generation feels foreign to them, and as is human nature, people often resist what is unfamiliar. This can lead to tension between the two groups. However, through ongoing dialogue and education, such disparities can be bridged. For instance, in the early stages of women's rights activism, many older individuals were resistant to the idea, deeming it inappropriate. Yet today, we find numerous older individuals who are active supporters of these causes.In summary, I believe that the influence and power of the younger generation stem from their assertiveness and drive to initiate change within society. While this may initially strain their relationships with older individuals, I am confident that over time, these differences can be reconciled as the older generation adapts to and accepts these new social dynamics.
351;Write about the following topic:In many countries, not enough students study science subjects. What are the causes? What will be the effect on society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, there are many courses available to take, from arts that include theatre and music to scientific topics such as mathemathics, physics, chemistry, biology and medicine. There is an evidence that the amount of students willing to learn science subjects is not sufficient. In this essay I will discuss the causes of the issue and the possible effect on society.There are several casues for the fact that students tend to skip science subjects. First, studying science can be hard and exhausting. The complexity of some subjects such as math and physics requires from the student to study many hours at home. Secondly, there are students who do not only find those courses difficult, but also get low marks even after studying long hours. As for chemistry classes, some courses include labratory lessons which may not appeal to some students.The importance of people having knowledge in science is great. The society relies on science on a daily basis. For instance, doctors who study medicine, must know mathematics, biology and chemistry well, because biology is relevant to the patient's body. In addition, doctors prescribe medications so they must know chemistry well. Another example is architects whose job is to plan and design buildings. Without a proper knowledge in physics, they could not plan buildings.Discussing those facts, studying science can be challenging. However, it is vital for the society that students will study science. Without doctors, nurses, scientists and other professions that rely on science, the health of the society might be effected negatively.;Today, there is an abundance of courses available across a wide range of disciplines, from the arts, such as theater and music, to scientific fields like mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine. Nonetheless, evidence suggests that there is a shortage of students interested in pursuing science subjects. In this essay, I will explore the reasons behind this issue and its potential implications for society.Several factors contribute to the trend of students avoiding science subjects. First and foremost, science can be perceived as difficult and demanding. The intricacies of disciplines like mathematics and physics often require students to dedicate numerous hours to study outside the classroom. Additionally, some students struggle to achieve satisfactory grades despite their efforts, leading to frustration and disinterest. In chemistry classes, for instance, laboratory work may deter some students who are not as interested in hands-on experiments.The significance of scientific knowledge in society cannot be overstated. We rely on science in our everyday lives. For example, medical professionals, such as doctors, must have a firm grasp of mathematics, biology, and chemistry, as these subjects are critical to understanding the human body and prescribing medications. Similarly, architects need a solid foundation in physics to effectively design and construct buildings.In light of these points, while studying science can be challenging, it is essential for the progress of society that students engage with these subjects. The absence of qualified professionals—such as doctors, nurses, and scientists—could have detrimental effects on public health and welfare.
1185;Write about the following topic:Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Poverty has been always a major issue around the world. Due to viruses, natural disasters, and poor management in the country and overpopulation, each day the poverty increases. In addition, some developed countries ignore the help or just give a temporary solution. Poverty has a great effect on the income that can lead to serious problems.To begin with, developed countries shouldn't only support with financial aid, as that kind of solution will not help the people. In my opinion, rich countries can stop poverty in such way to look for the natural resources of the poor country and to help and develop its resources. For example, in Africa they are famous for their large area of land. A rich country can take this opportunity to implement a long-term plan to benefit and fight poverty, such as to start expanding the lands of agriculture to use their natural resources such as cocoa, rice, and coffee. Furthermore, this idea can also help the people of the country where they can work on the land and be employed.Also, developed countries can donate and build health care centers and schools to prevent the dangerous disease from spreading. Schools can empower children to grow up and help the country's economy to rise and to fight poverty.In conclusion, developed countries can unite and discuss this significant concern rather than helping with financial support as poverty is taking the lives of many children. Poor countries just need better solutions and understanding from the world to prevent such problems from continuing to happen.;Poverty has long been a critical global challenge. Factors such as pandemics, natural disasters, ineffective governance, and overpopulation contribute to its persistent escalation. Many developed nations either overlook the urgency of assisting or provide only temporary fixes. The impact of poverty on income can lead to severe social and economic issues.To address this, developed countries should go beyond merely offering financial aid, as such measures often fail to foster lasting change. Instead, I believe that wealthier nations should invest in tapping into the natural resources of impoverished countries to aid in their development. For instance, Africa is renowned for its vast agricultural potential. Rich nations could seize this opportunity to implement sustainable, long-term strategies aimed at alleviating poverty by expanding agricultural initiatives that utilize local resources, including cocoa, rice, and coffee. This approach not only combats poverty but also provides employment opportunities for local populations.Additionally, developed nations should invest in building healthcare facilities and schools in these regions to curb the spread of infectious diseases. Education empowers children, equipping them with the skills to aid in their country's economic growth and contribute to poverty alleviation.In summary, it is essential for developed countries to collaborate and address this pressing issue rather than simply providing financial assistance. Poverty continues to devastate countless lives, especially among children, and impoverished nations require comprehensive solutions and genuine understanding from the global community to halt this cycle.
343;Write about the following topic:Some people believe that it is important to spend a lot of money on family celebrations. While others think it is a waste of money. Discuss both views.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Spending money in family celebrations can be seen as a way of appreciating where one comes from. Although some people say it is a total waste of money, l assert that it is wiser.To begin with, many people feel that it is of no importance to consume money on family gatherings. This is because people usually have more pressing issues in life like urgent health cases that require money. Also, some struggle to provide basic needs for their families, for example, tuitions, decent meals and shelter. For these reasons, it seems using money on family gatherings is just a luxury.Despite the merits of the arguments above, although many say it is wasteful to financially cater for family parties, l assert that it is crucial. One reason is that, it unites families and a sweet spirit is maintained if family members are recognised for their special days such as wedding anniversaries, birthdays and graduations where money is spent. Further, appreciation to others within the family cannot be expressed in many ways without forking out some money.Furthermore, money has to be spent on family get togethers where everyone is in a joyous mood so that people can catch up and release stresses from their straining personal lives. What is more, culture, closeness and love is easily displayed when families come together for such celebrations and use money for their own satisfaction. For instance, when my childhood birthdays were celebrated, l felt so much loved and l still cherish the memories as l vividly can recall.To conclude, although others feel that it is money consuming to fund family gatherings, l advocate that it is a wiser option. Should this be the case, love within families would not wax cold and family members would feel more appreciated.;Investing in family celebrations can serve as a meaningful way to honor one's roots. While some people view this as a waste of money, I believe it is a worthwhile expense.Many individuals feel that spending money on family gatherings is insignificant, especially when they face pressing issues such as urgent medical bills or struggles to meet basic needs like education, food, and housing. Given these challenges, they often perceive spending on family events as a luxury rather than a necessity.However, despite these valid concerns, I argue that financially supporting family celebrations is essential. Such gatherings foster unity and help maintain strong familial bonds, especially when we acknowledge important milestones like anniversaries, birthdays, and graduations with monetary contributions. Moreover, expressing gratitude and appreciation within the family often necessitates a financial investment.Additionally, spending money on family get-togethers creates a joyful atmosphere where individuals can reconnect and relieve the stress of their daily lives. These events also allow for the expression of culture, closeness, and love, making the investments in such occasions deeply satisfying. For example, I vividly remember the love I felt during my childhood birthday celebrations, and those cherished memories remain with me to this day.In conclusion, despite the perspective that funding family gatherings may seem extravagant, I advocate for its wisdom. By prioritizing these celebrations, we can strengthen familial love and ensure that family members feel valued and appreciated.
1199;Write about the following topic:Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Is competition instructive or toxic for children? There is a debate around this topic. There are those who believe that a sense of competition should be supported. On the other standpoint, there are those who believe that rather that compete children have to learn how to co-operate. I believe that supporters of competicions are partly right but also that co-operation between children is essential. The two strategy can be taken together to give to childrens all the tools they need to became useful adults.On the one hand, there are people who believe that to compete is essential for the growth of children. They believe that competitions rise the ambitions of children. They develop certain attitudes thanks to which they will have always bigger dreams and desire. The idea, therefore, is that children who have grown making competiions will became important managers because of their instinctive desire to be winners and successful persons. It is true that competitions permit childrens to develop their ambitions and to do the best they can in order to win. However, I strongly believe that a good understanding of the aim of competitions should be taught before they start to compete. Indeed, children have to understand the instructive role of competition and how manage the possible distructive consequences that could derive if a child is not ready to lose. Children should start a competition being aware of the possibility of lose and the possibility to win. I believe that is important to stimulate children in doing competitions but teaching them the important role of defeats and the role of coperation. This lead me to analyse the second standpoint.There are, indeed, people who dislike competitions at all. They believe they are toxic for the growth of children. According to them, it is negative to teach children to be against between each other. Rather, children should learn how to work together and co-operate. Surely, co-operation is a vital skill in workplaces. The ability to work in team is one of the most searched by different businesses. To learn how to work together means for children to understand their role in a group and also to think about the ideas that should support the team itself. Co-operation then permits children to develop fundamental social skills. However, co-operation alone is not enough for children's instruction. I believe that co-operation is possible just if a child is also learning how to work and produce something alone. Children, in order to advances ideas and give a good support in a team, have to learn to be ambitious and this is possible thanks to competitions.In conclusion, I believe that an instruction in which single competitions as well as team-works are encouraged is the most useful and productive in order to grow up efficient adults.;Is competition beneficial or harmful for children? This topic sparks a lively debate. Some argue that fostering a competitive spirit is essential, while others advocate for the importance of cooperation among children. Personally, I acknowledge the merits of competition but believe that teamwork is equally crucial. By integrating both approaches, we can equip children with the tools they need to become well-rounded adults.On one side of the debate, there are those who assert that competition is vital for a child's development. They argue that competition fuels children's ambitions, nurturing traits that inspire them to aspire to greater heights. The notion is that children who engage in competitive environments are likely to become successful leaders, driven by a deep-seated desire to win and excel. While it's true that competition can spur kids to realize their ambitions and strive for success, it's imperative that we teach them the underlying purpose of competition before they participate. Children must grasp that competition has an educational role and learn how to cope with the potentially discouraging effects of losing. They should enter competitive situations with an understanding that both winning and losing are possible outcomes. Encouraging children to compete, while concurrently instilling the importance of learning from defeats and the value of cooperation, leads me to consider the opposing viewpoint.On the other hand, there are those who completely reject competition, viewing it as detrimental to children's development. They argue that pitting children against one another cultivates negativity, and instead, children should focus on learning to collaborate effectively. Undoubtedly, cooperation is a vital skill in today’s workplaces, with teamwork being highly sought after by employers. Teaching children how to work together helps them understand their roles within a group and emphasizes the importance of contributing ideas that benefit the team. Through cooperation, children develop essential social skills. Nevertheless, I contend that cooperation alone does not suffice for a child’s education. Effective collaboration can only occur if children also learn how to work independently and generate their own ideas. To contribute meaningfully in a team, children need to cultivate ambition, which can be fostered through competitive experiences.In conclusion, I believe that an educational framework that promotes both individual competition and teamwork is the most effective way to nurture capable and efficient adults.
397;Write about the following topic:Some people think that hosting an international sports event is good for the country, while some people think it is bad. Discuss both views and state your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;International sports events are one of the most trendy interactions at any hosting country. Depending on the hoster, the events could represent a virtue or a slip. This dependence is associated with the costs, logisitcs, marketing, etc. I tend to be of the opinion, that the virtues outweigh the disadvantages and that they shall be considered as opportunities to exploit.Some people think of the international sport events as being disadvantageous, because for example of being a pressure on the countries' infrastructure as well as the provided services and facilities. Another reason might emerge as some countries also might not be well-suited for such events. For instance, despite spending a big budget on the organisation of the event, the lack of qualified personnel or needed objects and materials shall cause a massive distruction of the hostees' experiences.The other perpective of the usages and utilization of such events could be clear through the massive amount of virtues, which these events normally brings to the hosting countries. For example, these events are regularly sponsored from international organisation, which provide the financial means not for only the logisitcs of the events, but additionally fees for the hosters. Furthermore, the financial benefits shall not stop by the provided fees through the owning organisation, but also the global or regional branding of such country will affect the tourism and the local service providers absolutely positive.Concluding, international sport events could be absolutely virtous, if the hosting countries were to implement their strategies successfully. Should such countries be willing to give the event the raw focus on the organisation and the user-experience, that would absolutely lead to massive benefits financially, marketing-wise and from intercultural perspective.;"International sports events are among the most impactful interactions for any host country. Their significance can vary greatly depending on how well the event is managed, affecting outcomes such as costs, logistics, and marketing. I believe that the benefits of hosting these events often outweigh the drawbacks, presenting valuable opportunities for growth.Critics argue that international sports events can strain a country's infrastructure, services, and facilities. Additionally, some nations may not be adequately prepared to host these large-scale events. Despite investing considerable budgets, a lack of qualified personnel or necessary resources can detract from the overall experience for participants and visitors.On the other hand, the advantages of hosting such events are plentiful. These events often receive sponsorship from international organizations, which not only covers logistical costs but also provides financial support to the hosts. Moreover, the economic benefits extend beyond direct funding; the global or regional exposure can significantly boost tourism and positively impact local businesses.In conclusion, international sports events can be incredibly beneficial if host countries effectively implement their strategies. By prioritizing organization and the visitor experience, countries can reap substantial financial rewards, enhance their marketing opportunities, and foster intercultural connections."

Not only because it is a combination of text, audio and video, but also due to its . It has threatened the domination of spreading news of the traditional media, and, I would say, is about to take control.We can find everything we want on the Internet – the latest news, books, songs, movies, cartoons… . With the radio, we can merely hear. Compared to a newspaper, the radio and TV can provide the latest information. For instance the breaking news of the Americans’ attacking Iraq was immediately online, as well as that the Twin Towers of New York were destroyed on September 11, 2001. However, we just cannot .The Internet is a way of getting information, as long as your mobile phone is connected or you possess a laptop. When I am a vehicle, I usually have my cellphone connected to the Internet, then browse through what in the past few hours, or log in MSN to begin a conversation with my friends. Reading a newspaper is also a good way to kill time, but for me, a youngster, it is not so modern as “surfing online while commuting”.The traditional media will never disappear, though the Internet has taken a big advantage the competition. And definitely, there is still a long way for the Internet to go. , the Internet benefits me the most, and I highly appreciate it.;"Today, we have various sources for news, including radio, television, newspapers, and the Internet. In my opinion, the Internet stands out as the best of these options. Since its inception, the Internet has rapidly evolved into a thriving industry. It effectively combines text, audio, and video, and it poses a significant challenge to traditional media by gradually reshaping how news is disseminated.On the Internet, we can access a vast array of content, including the latest news, books, music, movies, and cartoons. Unlike radio, which offers only audio, and television or newspapers that can provide timely updates, the Internet delivers real-time information from across the globe. For example, breaking news about the U.S. military actions in Iraq and the tragic events of September 11, 2001, were immediately available online.Accessing information through the Internet is straightforward, as long as you have a mobile device or a laptop with an Internet connection. When I’m on the go, I often keep my cellphone connected to the Internet, allowing me to catch up on recent news or chat with friends on messaging platforms. While reading a newspaper can be a good way to pass the time, I find that ""surfing the web while commuting"" feels more modern and engaging, especially for someone my age.Although traditional media will not vanish completely, the Internet has clearly gained a substantial edge in this competitive landscape. There’s still much potential for the Internet's growth. Personally, I find it incredibly beneficial, and I truly value what it offers."
1377;should children grow up in the city or countryside (advantages/disadvantages)?;Some people think it is better for children to grown up in the city, while others think that life in the countryside is more suitable for them. What are the advantages and disadvantages of both places?Living in the rural area is the best option for children by a group of people, while others believe that cities offer more opportunities. In my opinion, if the city offers security and green areas, I agree it is a better place to raise the next generation some advantages both sides.Firstly, the countryside in touch with nature, taking care of animals and helping with the gardening. Because of that, they learn how to protect the environment and to live without any technological equipment. Besides that, they have more freedom to play outside the house without any security worries, whereas in the city they are kept at home smartphones and computers for this reason. On the other hand, schools usually have lower quality and it is hard to find extracurricular classes. Therefore, children difficulties trying to develop their abilities besides the school curriculum.However, schools at metropolitan areas tend to have better quality and offer all kinds of activities. Even if there is a sport or an art course that the institution does not offer, it is possible to look for it in another place around the city. As a result, all children’s talents and passions can be easier to develop. On the other hand, security, pollution and contact with nature are issues that we have to worry about. The better option would be a city with an excellent quality of life where children could play in parks and gardens.To sum up, growing up in the countryside can be very positive for someone’s childhood, but the city will usually offer better opportunities for their talents’ development.This is a well written essay.

What are the pros and cons of both environments? A segment of the population suggests that rural areas provide the best childhood experience, whereas others contend that cities present more opportunities. In my view, if cities prioritize safety and green spaces, I believe they are preferable for raising the next generation due to several advantages on both sides.Firstly, living in the countryside allows children to connect with nature, care for animals, and engage in gardening. This connection teaches them to protect the environment and live without reliance on technology. Additionally, children in rural areas often enjoy greater freedom to play outdoors without safety concerns, unlike their city counterparts who may stay indoors with smartphones and computers. However, the educational quality in rural schools often lags, and it can be challenging to find extracurricular activities. Consequently, children may struggle to nurture their skills beyond the standard curriculum.Conversely, schools in metropolitan areas generally offer higher-quality education and a wide range of extracurricular activities. Even if a particular sport or art class is not available at their school, children can often find alternatives elsewhere in the city. This accessibility allows for easier development of their talents and passions. On the downside, urban living raises concerns about safety, pollution, and limited contact with nature. Ideally, the best option would be a city that offers an excellent quality of life, providing children the opportunity to play in parks and gardens.In conclusion, while growing up in the countryside has its benefits for childhood development, cities typically provide superior opportunities for nurturing individual talents. Overall, this essay effectively addresses all aspects of the topic, with well-extended arguments supported by examples. The information is logically organized, and most ideas are seamlessly linked with appropriate transitional phrases. The vocabulary choice effectively conveys the writer’s meaning, though some wording could be further refined. Most sentences are error-free and showcase a variety of complexities.

1379;should unpaid community work be mandatory in high school (agree/disagree)?;"Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programs (for example working for a charity, improving the neighborhood or teaching sports to younger children). To what extent do you agree or disagree?It is argued that voluntary services charity, cleaning the neighborhood, imparting knowledge to the underprivileged, should be made mandatory in the high school curriculum. I strongly agree as it not only helps in students becoming socially responsible adults but also in shaping their character.Firstly, community service inculcates a sense of responsibility towards the society, something that is needed to shape a good society. For instance, the introduction of Swatch Bharath scheme in my school, The Hyderabad Public School, ten years ago taught me not only to keep the surroundings of the school clean but also to never litter wherever I go. Hence, now I feel responsible to maintain cleanliness everywhere. Such services are needed to develop a better society in the future.Secondly, voluntary services cater to the overall character development of an individual. It a feeling of empathy in children which is needed to build a better character. For example, an alumnus of Montessori High School, who indulged in petty law-breaking activities during school confessed that it was the charity service that he did in high school; which in his mind; him in becoming a better person for his family and refrained him from committing socially irresponsible acts. Thus, such voluntary activities teach us to value what we have and in turn to our personality development.That being said, we cannot deny the fact that many students misuse the time allocated for these services by considering it as an excursion to enjoy with friends rather than a learning .In conclusion, although compulsory voluntary community service has its drawbacks, it is still useful in shaping a child as a socially responsible citizen and also in their overall personality development. Therefore, pupils should be encouraged to involve themselves in such activities.This is a well written essay. It addresses all parts of the task and the arguments and ideas are developed and supported. The information is presented in a logical order and the ideas are linked by appropriate connective words. The use of vocabulary conveys the exact meaning of the writer and there are only minor instances of a word being used somewhat unnaturally. Sentence formation demonstrates a high level of control and very few errors (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows suggested corrections). Overall this essay seems good enough for IELTS Band 8 level.";Some individuals contend that engaging in unpaid community service should be a mandated component of high school curriculums, such as working for charities, enhancing local neighborhoods, or coaching sports for younger children. I wholeheartedly agree with this perspective, as it not only fosters a sense of social responsibility in students but also contributes to their overall character development.To begin with, participating in community service instills a sense of accountability toward society, which is essential for cultivating a better community. For example, when my school, The Hyderabad Public School, implemented the Swachh Bharat initiative a decade ago, it taught me the importance of keeping our school environment clean and reinforced the idea of not littering in any location. As a result, I now feel a personal obligation to uphold cleanliness everywhere I go. Such initiatives are crucial for nurturing a more responsible society in the future.Furthermore, community service plays a significant role in the holistic development of an individual's character. It fosters empathy among children, which is vital for their moral growth. Take, for instance, a former student of Montessori High School who engaged in minor delinquent behavior during his time there. He later reflected that participating in charity work during high school had a profound impact on him, enabling him to become a better person for his family and steering him away from socially irresponsible actions. Consequently, these voluntary activities help us appreciate our privileges and contribute positively to our character development.That said, it is important to acknowledge that some students may misuse the time designated for these services, viewing it as merely a chance for socializing with friends instead of an opportunity for personal growth.In conclusion, while mandated community service does have some potential downsides, its benefits in promoting social responsibility and fostering character development among youth are undeniable. Therefore, students should be encouraged to actively participate in such meaningful activities. This essay effectively addresses all aspects of the prompt, presenting arguments and ideas in a well-organized manner. The arguments are supported with relevant examples, and transitions between ideas are smooth. The vocabulary is appropriately chosen, conveying precise meanings, with only a few minor instances of slightly awkward phrasing. The sentence structures demonstrate a high level of proficiency, with very few errors. Overall, this essay is likely to achieve an IELTS Band 8 level.
917;‘Failure is proof that the desire wasn’t strong enough’To what extent do you agree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Failure is what nobody wish for, but it could occur secondarily to an unsuccessful attempt towards ones goal, for various reasons. I am in the view that, failure is not a proof of lack of desire, rather it is more to do with improper techniques, less allocation of time and lack of proper attitude.It is the general view that, ultimate success in any field is taught through the failures in life. One can be subjected to multiple failures due to lack of ability to develop essential skill set, also known as techniques, that would be essential to achieve a certain goal. One classic example is Thomas Alwa Eddison, the great inventor of all time, who went through nearly 100 unsucessfull experiments, before inventing the light bulb. He was brave enough to accept the failure experiments had taught him 100 different impossible ways not to discover the light bulb.On the other hand, time plays one of the most crucial factors in obtaining a goal/success. By this I meant, the time that is allocated towards full filling tasks that are directed towards preparing for the goal. The little time is spent during the preparation, the further away the goal felt like. For an instance, one cannot expected to win a marothon with just one day preparation.Similarly, attitude plays by far the most striking part of the success. This is simple as, one cannot dream of becoming a good physician, having shown no interest in paying attention to people and their health related complaints.In a nut shell, failure is not a proof for inadequate desire in fact, failure is due to improper practices of techniques,failure of managing time in preparing and attitudes that fires the drive.;"Failure is something that no one desires, but it can happen as a result of unsuccessful attempts to reach one's goals for a variety of reasons. I believe that failure does not indicate a lack of ambition; instead, it often results from ineffective methods, insufficient time investment, and an inadequate mindset.It is widely accepted that true success in any area is often achieved through the lessons learned from failures. Numerous setbacks can arise from an inability to develop the necessary skills or techniques that are critical to accomplishing a particular objective. A well-known example is Thomas Edison, the legendary inventor who experienced nearly 100 failed experiments before successfully creating the light bulb. He courageously embraced each failure as a lesson, understanding that those 100 attempts were simply ways not to succeed in inventing the light bulb.Time also plays a vital role in achieving goals and success. Specifically, the time dedicated to tasks that prepare one for their objectives is crucial. The less time spent on preparation, the farther away the goal may seem. For instance, one cannot expect to win a marathon with just a single day of training. Similarly, attitude is perhaps the most significant factor in achieving success. It is straightforward: one cannot aspire to be a good physician without demonstrating a genuine interest in understanding patients and their health concerns.In summary, failure should not be seen as evidence of insufficient desire; rather, it stems from ineffective techniques, poor time management in preparation, and attitudes that fuel one’s motivation."
1419;“Some people say that the education system is the only critical factor to development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?”;Education plays a vital role in the development of a country. Therefore, some people think that the education system is the only important factor to the development of a country and they may be right.Education is the foundation of developed society. It is rightly said, ‘education is a ladder success’. If all the people of any country are educated then they becomes broadminded, civilized and progressive. An educated society improves the standard of life as well., education also creates a good employment opportunity and therefore country does not have to suffer from big problems like unemployment. Educated peoples are more aware of such as pollution and many more. A country becomes technologically advanced because of educated people.Not only this, but also by giving importance to education, the nations can get rid of problems like , poverty, unemployment and population growth that delay the progress of a nation. The crime rate can also be kept under . The standard of living of the people will go up. If the nations to be progressive it is very important that the people are more educated and progressive. Any country can become more technologically advanced and developed because of education.However, there are other factors that also play an important role in the development of a country. Such as governments have to encouraged people to do soIn conclusion, I would like to say that a good education system will lead to a developed country.;"Education is crucial for a country's development. Many people believe that the education system is the primary driver of this growth, and they may be correct. Education serves as the bedrock of a progressive society; as the saying goes, ""education is a ladder to success."" When a nation’s populace is educated, they tend to become more open-minded, civilized, and forward-thinking. An educated community not only enhances the quality of life but also leads to better employment opportunities, reducing issues like unemployment.Moreover, educated individuals are more likely to be aware of pressing issues such as pollution and other social challenges. An educated workforce is essential for a country's technological advancement. Additionally, prioritizing education helps address significant problems like poverty, unemployment, and rapid population growth, all of which can hinder national progress. A well-educated society is often associated with lower crime rates and improved living standards. While education is vital, it is important to recognize that other factors also contribute to a nation's development. For instance, government support and encouragement play a significant role in fostering an educated populace. In conclusion, a robust education system is fundamental to achieving a developed and prosperous nation."
