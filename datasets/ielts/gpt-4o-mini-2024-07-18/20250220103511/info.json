In my opinion, it is very controversial question, but I believe that nations who are tolerant to others and friendly are able to succeed in constracting better world not only for themselves and their surroundings but also for future generations. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view about attractiveness and development of countries based on national diversity.\nOn the one hand, people of different nationalities are hardly able to understand each other and can be impatient for people who have another nationalities, that can create difficulties in communication, making agreements, sovling of problems. For example, people with different backgrounds can strat arguing about better governmental constitutions and politics, religions, educational system, traditional and another types of medicine, and so on. It worths to mention that none of those people will be completely right, if they deside to show off their experience instead of accepting ideas of others and just giving advice. Moreover, some disputes can even lead to quarrels, but not to finding the better dessisions, that can influence on safety of people with different nationalities. So, for living peacefully and sharing some ideas of better developmental practice, people should first of all respect each other independantly of their nantionalities.\nOn the other hand, people of various nationalities are able to create not only interesting and diverse community, but also share knowlege and experience in order to achieve the best results in countries' development. For achieving this, people should follow several basic rules, which are usually unwritten, but those mental and behavioral lows should be understood by everyone. Firstly, they should be tolerant to each other and accepting some differences. Secondly, they should be polite when they want to share their knowlege and experiences, not showing off. Thirdly, it would be wonderful if they are able to create international community where people can communicate and make friends. Last but not least, they should remember that their attitudes for each other influence on the world as a whole where they and their children live, so they should be responsible for their words and behavior.\nIn conclusion, countries which managed to connect people of different nationalities and create a friendly surroundings, in my opinion, are able to develope faster and look like fascinating diverse community which consist of people of various backgrounds."
